DRoseCantStop,"He has been getting into the groove of things lately. There is no doubt his injury from last season has regressed his play, but he has been dominating the paint and getting rebounds.

DRoseCantStop,Please make these Jo
DRoseCantStop,Steph's wife Ayesha.
DRoseCantStop,"I wanted him to take this job ever since December. He's a very respectable guy, someone who can establish great relationships with the players, and can make adjustments if ever need be. Thibs has done a lot for us while he was here, but making adjustments during games was not his forte. 

This season was our best chance at winning the East and we still couldn't get it done. Our offense needed an upgrade badly, and I think with Fred at the helm we can go places with the talent we have now. Not too concerned about our defense, especially if we end up retaining Adrian Griffin.

DRoseCantStop,"Can't blame the refs on that, just missing shots and letting the Cavs back into the game. Step it up Bulls."

GhostifiedMark,Sure why not
GhostifiedMark,Eat your heart out Skip Bayless
GhostifiedMark,Blake has been so disappointing 
GhostifiedMark,"So I missed most of the first quarter

What happened"
GhostifiedMark,"What has she ever done to deserved to get hated?

And I don't get the hype for her...I don't think she's ugly but she seems like she's 1 or 2 makeup fixes away from showing her age

I like Cari on first take better"
GhostifiedMark,Wow
GhostifiedMark,"Lmao Taj

Hitting Delly is like a big no no"
GhostifiedMark,Curry... Jesus
GhostifiedMark,Tracy Wolfson mole...

GhostifiedMark,"Jon ""I'm the last guy ESPN wants to commentate on a game"" Barry"
GhostifiedMark,Wow Pierce could have been with the Clippers
GhostifiedMark,Steph Curridiculous
GhostifiedMark,What happens when you put an off ball player on an off ball player...
GhostifiedMark,I mean...we can't talk...Wade and Chalmers aren't saints when it comes to flopping 
GhostifiedMark,ANOTHER BLOCK?
GhostifiedMark,Isn't shump injured?
GhostifiedMark,Yeesh should have just scored 
GhostifiedMark,Tony Allen lol
GhostifiedMark,You know I've never seen the godfather movies and I own the box set
GhostifiedMark,I want rockets to win this game just for the lil b thing to die for a while 
GhostifiedMark,He can't get more minutes than Rashad Lewis and Ray Allen

GhostifiedMark,Lol no need to throw stuff
GhostifiedMark,Lmao shaq
GhostifiedMark,Damn DJ
GhostifiedMark,"Blake has been bad this game 

And fuck Jason Terry"
GhostifiedMark,So idk why but my step dad is rooting for the wizards
GhostifiedMark,"I know there are some players you hate but then they're on your team and you root for them

Terry isn't that player for me lol"
GhostifiedMark,CP fucking 3
GhostifiedMark,I learned this like last week and I had funny thought of Steph Curry going home
GhostifiedMark,They miss Mike Conley 
GhostifiedMark,i will never forget that lol
GhostifiedMark,He got a hitch shot
GhostifiedMark,Idk about that
GhostifiedMark,Doc: goddamn...
GhostifiedMark,I'm sure people don't know what salty means anymore
GhostifiedMark,You could see the disappointment on Valde's face when she mentioned the Kings run
GhostifiedMark,i think he's playing scared fur to foul trouble
GhostifiedMark,"If you're gonna hide behind the free speech bill of right just to be an asshole, don't be surprised if an asshole retaliates. Its been shown time and time again that poking the bear never leaves good results. Don't bitch when you get mauled."
GhostifiedMark,Lol the one time he makes a 3
GhostifiedMark,"I had to research Yakama

I've always wanted to ask a native american descent this: Do you any issues with the Washington Redskins situation?"
GhostifiedMark,Nice throwback jerseys
GhostifiedMark,This is why you don't boo paul pierce
GhostifiedMark,Lol if he made that 
GhostifiedMark,Maybe he sees harden as a threat to Kobe
GhostifiedMark,In that replay they don't even show the part where the clock prematurely runs out. Matt Barnes only knew because everyone saw the play. 
GhostifiedMark,"It doesn't matter what the refs call cause at the end of the day, someone is gonna bitch"
GhostifiedMark,I was confused for a second but I got it lol
GhostifiedMark,I didn't even notice..ugh..

GhostifiedMark,Jesus Christ 
GhostifiedMark,My god Harlan your hair
GhostifiedMark,"Can you imagine the Lakers announcers now if that happened in this era lol

It would be a lot more than 

"".....he makes it!"""
GhostifiedMark,"Curry mom comments incoming....
Again"
GhostifiedMark,"It helps him guard opposing centers but man I feel like the weight is limiting him offensively

Plus he's older...forgot about that"
GhostifiedMark,Money? 
GhostifiedMark,Too late
GhostifiedMark,"People here knows it was a joke right?
"
GhostifiedMark,"Harden: that wasn't a foul?!?!??

Ref: nah

Harden: goddamn "
GhostifiedMark,Is Reddit broken or something?
GhostifiedMark,Can't argue with that logic
GhostifiedMark,Well that was a fun game
GhostifiedMark,"It won't happen but if Lebron and Noah duke it out this game thread, the crowd, the city of Chicago and Cleveland, and ESPN will explode"
GhostifiedMark,Lol why does ESPN alert us that sports center is starting on another channel? I don't think anyone cares
GhostifiedMark,Lebron looking like me at the park when I get 3 happy
GhostifiedMark,Nightwing
GhostifiedMark,Nice name 
GhostifiedMark,Matt Barnes needs to knock down some 3s
GhostifiedMark,"He has a hitch shot...kinda like Carlos Boozer

Lol at me getting down voted. If it goes in,  good for him. Still bad looking form"
GhostifiedMark,Why is Nick Johnson getting minutes? 
GhostifiedMark,JJ is in a zone
GhostifiedMark,Church usually ends at 1
GhostifiedMark,"It's bad enough that ball dominant Harden is deadly

I can't imagine what Off Ball Harden looks like"
GhostifiedMark,"You can't deny that its mind boggling that the Cavs PR department approved of it. There's hot topic issues in sports talking about domestic violence and child abuse...why in the fuck would you release a cheesy video of a guy tossing a girl into a coffee table and ending it off with the girl saying its her fault for being a bulls fan (something the male counterpart doesn't like)

Sad part about this is that it wasn't even funny. "
GhostifiedMark,Why is dirk wearing lipstick?
GhostifiedMark,Lol I need to see the replay  
GhostifiedMark,"&gt;If that's **isn't** the look of pure competition I don't know what is

FTFY"
GhostifiedMark,"One day I hope the crowd screams ""HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERS"" if he ever leads a fast break

It won't happen but the thought of it is hilarious "
GhostifiedMark,Lmao that's a bad call but Blake post moves have always looked wonky to me
GhostifiedMark,"Lol damn

I wish it worked out when your FO brought those guys together. Would have been fun to see the Pistons back in playoff contention again"
GhostifiedMark,"lol my god

"
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Clippers guard the 3 point line
GhostifiedMark,I just realized that the clippers are ridiculously small
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn
GhostifiedMark,"Idk man

He still has to aim"
GhostifiedMark,What a weird game 
GhostifiedMark,It actually wasn't that bad compared to the Bulls/Bucks series or the Cavs/Celtics series
GhostifiedMark,😒
GhostifiedMark,Lol Livingston you had an open curry at the elbow
GhostifiedMark,"People want the underdog to win

Personally I have no pick in this fight and FUCK JASON TERRY"
GhostifiedMark,Nene did a good thing 
GhostifiedMark,That guy with the mop has a serious afro
GhostifiedMark,"I agree with this

The slow mo makes it a lot worse than what it is. If I recall that play correctly, Lebron was going full speed"
GhostifiedMark,Really bad imo
GhostifiedMark,Let's blame Reggie for the hack
GhostifiedMark,lol i almost thought Pop wasn't gonna do it
GhostifiedMark,I agree with Harlan. They waved the white flag a little too early 
GhostifiedMark,Warriors are just enjoying Harden right now
GhostifiedMark,"I agree that it isn't much but if I were to run a business as big as a basketball franchise, I would be so pissed at the team that made the video. No owner wants to have bad publicity and I won't be surprised if someone gets fired."
GhostifiedMark,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who heard that lol

Fucking Jon Barry"
GhostifiedMark,ROFL Hubie 
GhostifiedMark,Lmao Perk made a 3
GhostifiedMark,Meh
GhostifiedMark,You may need to fix that
GhostifiedMark,Wait no...where is Ernie
GhostifiedMark,Damn JR just shitted on Butler 
GhostifiedMark,"Lmao oh yeah I remember so many rockets fans shat on the eastern conference every time people here talked about the southwest division 

"
GhostifiedMark,"I think he rides the momentum of the game. The clippers were pushing a little run there and if the clippers converted, his excitement would have been warranted."
GhostifiedMark,I thought it was hilarious 
GhostifiedMark,"Lol Hawks do not boo Pierce

"
GhostifiedMark,Lol Scott you're killing the hawks
GhostifiedMark,Lmao oh shit Horford
GhostifiedMark,.... What a bad title
GhostifiedMark,Second time he's shot a 3 and they won't give it to jim
GhostifiedMark,Lol Bazemore is the most confident guy on the hawks team
GhostifiedMark,I mean...I wanna say that I like rap music to prove my case but they're mostly underground rappers and that won't help
GhostifiedMark,Idk what the situation is but yeah I don't think they're allowed to show plays
GhostifiedMark,"I've always liked Nene so seeing this is nice

Also is it me or has ESPN been fucking up with their audio? "
GhostifiedMark,"lol wall is like ""fuck off me!"""
GhostifiedMark,Holy shit Hawks D is slowly coming back to form 
GhostifiedMark,"I was actually referring to the Christian part. As for him hating gay people I just ignored it

I guess I should have mentioned that"
GhostifiedMark,"Lebron hair is weird man

Like on the side it looks kinda smooth cause of the waves but on the front it looks like its standing up"
GhostifiedMark,"When something is transparent, light is able to shine through the object. When something is translucent, light can come in but it gets lost within the object or something like that."
GhostifiedMark,I agree that he it was a bad game but man I really hate this kind of criticism. Just because he isn't screaming doesn't mean he didn't care. 
GhostifiedMark,Its so fitting and sad 
GhostifiedMark,Did someone ever make a gif of Shaq crying?
GhostifiedMark,Korver has been bad this whole playoffs man
GhostifiedMark,That line makes it so much funnier 
GhostifiedMark,Lol he spent like 3 minutes complimenting Draymond Green and has been speechless at Curry's production
GhostifiedMark,I don't think I'll ever comprehend how Rose gets his shots up when he's at the rim
GhostifiedMark,"How does that line make you think it was staged?

You've never fallen among friends and make stupid statements like that? I do it from time to time"
GhostifiedMark,I wanna believe that he legitimately plays like that. Like when he's practicing he does that weird head flail thing as he goes for a hook shot
GhostifiedMark,Can't argue with that
GhostifiedMark,Hawks fans learn from the Raptors series...don't do that
GhostifiedMark,Can I come? I still need to fulfill my quest of getting black out drunk at a party and regret the decisions I've made afterward 
GhostifiedMark,"This guy has a rep for doing shit like this
"
GhostifiedMark,GRIT AND GRIND
GhostifiedMark,Elton brand gonna put the team on his back
GhostifiedMark,Nah his right foot was on the line 
GhostifiedMark,Rivers is growing!!!
GhostifiedMark,I've seen the headphones Curry is wearing....I think its supposed to have really nice bass and good highs
GhostifiedMark,You'll get downvoted but this made me laugh
GhostifiedMark,Regular season? The situation that guy is talking about happened very recently
GhostifiedMark,i mean that's an ideal situation but that rarely happens
GhostifiedMark,Lol jesus
GhostifiedMark,Lol Delly the savior 
GhostifiedMark,"Al ""Hassan Whiteside"" Horford"
GhostifiedMark,I forgot Marcus Teague was in the league 
GhostifiedMark,Wow they called it
GhostifiedMark,Yeah typing it is easy 
GhostifiedMark,Lol Baby Davis
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn I love the playoffs
GhostifiedMark,What's with the rockets having the colts sign
GhostifiedMark,"It's sad that I discussed 12 years a slave with some friends and my white friends hated it cause the movie is ""obviously pandering to the white guilt trend to appease black folks"""
GhostifiedMark,Silver should have dinner that last year if that was really true
GhostifiedMark,Lee has been good
GhostifiedMark,i'm pretty sure me and shaq and jordan could win a shit load of games if i tried really hard
GhostifiedMark,"So my step dad has changed the channel

He's mad at Boston, Bulls, and Hawks for letting this happen lol"
GhostifiedMark,Wow a flagrant 2?
GhostifiedMark,Josh Smith can go 11/13 from 3 and they still won't respect his shot
GhostifiedMark,"I think people overreacted to the ""don't be gay lebron"" comment"
GhostifiedMark,I think she looks better than Sage Steele
GhostifiedMark,He's a tech guy
GhostifiedMark,Lol clippers look small right now
GhostifiedMark,"Sure, seen it many times

Doesn't change that it look ridiculous. "
GhostifiedMark,He didn't take another dribble 
GhostifiedMark,"I believe it

Having Carroll and Thabo as your wings is a defensive nightmare "
GhostifiedMark,"the one with the glasses is Lebron, the other guy is Greg Oden.

Lebron never had a father figure so people have been joking around saying that Greg Oden is the father...there's some similarities."
GhostifiedMark,Fucking DJ
GhostifiedMark,If it's just a quote why not add the whole thing? 
GhostifiedMark,Didn't Blake move a little when Harden was in the air?
GhostifiedMark,"Clips fans when CP3 got injured and Griffin went on that tear, what was the record?"
GhostifiedMark,You think anyone would believe me if I told them that this was a halftime show for a basketball game?
GhostifiedMark,Have they always done that or is this a once time thing? 
GhostifiedMark,Your players don't respect his presence?
GhostifiedMark,How much do you think that guy made for doing that taco bell commercial?
GhostifiedMark,"A good example is when they covered your series with the Bulls

They had literally nothing to say"
GhostifiedMark,"Or its a mental thing?

You really think Doc would allow DJ to leave practice without practicing FTs"
GhostifiedMark,When was the last time these guy lost at home?
GhostifiedMark,Nah Speights is gone
GhostifiedMark,Lol what the hell harden
GhostifiedMark,Why not both
GhostifiedMark,I thought Memphis had a good chance but Conley went down :/
GhostifiedMark,Maybe if you cared about what karma does to you
GhostifiedMark,Lmao you honored the flair bet
GhostifiedMark,Is Al Horford pinky ok?
GhostifiedMark,really? i think i've seen it since the beginning of this series
GhostifiedMark,"TIL that Steph Curry is from Akron, Ohio"
GhostifiedMark,"you know how you get hot at the park

yeah i thought that person was me "
GhostifiedMark,"I agree

She knows her shit and loves talking about it"
GhostifiedMark,Hooooooooooly shit
GhostifiedMark,"To bad that was actually nice transition D from the dubs 

Both Steph and Klay blocked a lane for Harden to drive in and it went downhill from there"
GhostifiedMark,Lmao what a pass
GhostifiedMark,"Mark Jackson: Momma, there goes that man

His mom: stop saying that "
GhostifiedMark,Lol I thought DJ tipped it in
GhostifiedMark,2spooky4me
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Mike Miller why did you leave your man open
GhostifiedMark,kawhi with 4 fouls
GhostifiedMark,Corey Brewer holy shit
GhostifiedMark,"Five coaches have kept their job

Spo

Pop

Rick

Thibs (well for now)

....
Who am I forgetting?"
GhostifiedMark,lol instead of KOBE they'll yell CURRY
GhostifiedMark,tomato.jpg
GhostifiedMark,What does this even mean
GhostifiedMark,A girl I like drives a Honda Accord 
GhostifiedMark,"Lol you can't win with the people in this thread

*hawks commit a foul*

NBA WANTS LEBRON TO WIN.  LEAGUE RIGGED

*Cavs commit a foul*

NBA OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO EXTEND SERIES. LEAGUE RIGGED"
GhostifiedMark,"I meant the lineup they had on the court 

They had Blake playing the 5 and guards surrounding him (Paul, Rivers, Redick, Crawford) "
GhostifiedMark,Lol when Curry jacked up that shot Rockets fans were ready to punch a wall
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn Schröder
GhostifiedMark,Lol he'd become the most frustrating player to guard
GhostifiedMark,Can you imagine Kahwi or Mike Conley asking for another players number? 
GhostifiedMark,"Welp that's it

Warriors and Cavs"
GhostifiedMark,Lol Chris Webber 
GhostifiedMark,He kinda dribbles like him

I still don't agree that ALC is mainstream. "
GhostifiedMark,DDDJDD!!!!!
GhostifiedMark,I..I don't understand
GhostifiedMark,"I think for this situation /u/ThePun_ post explains it

&gt;Relevant NBA rules section:

&gt;Traveling:
To start a dribble after establishing a pivot foot, the ball must be released from the player’s hand before his pivot foot leaves the floor or he has committed a traveling violation. A player who receives the ball while moving is allowed a two count rhythm but must release the ball prior to the third step touching the floor. When ending his dribble a player may use a two count rhythm in coming to a stop, passing or shooting. **A player who falls to the floor while holding the ball or while coming to a stop may not gain an advantage by rolling on the floor.** A player who attempts a shot may not be the first to touch the ball if it fails to touch the backboard, rim or another player. If a player comes to a stop on the count of one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously, he may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he alights with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor. If a player has one foot on the floor or lands with one foot first to the floor, he may only pivot with that foot. Once that foot is lifted from the floor to shoot or pass it may not return until the ball is released. If a player jumps off one foot on the count of one he may land with both feet simultaneously for count two. In this situation, the player may not pivot with either foot and if one or both feet leave the floor the ball must be released before either return to the floor. When a player gathers the ball he may not step consecutively with the same foot, as in a hopping motion."

GhostifiedMark,Wow you sure are a risk taker

GhostifiedMark,"Kyle ""Anthony Davis"" Korver"
GhostifiedMark,Lob City

GhostifiedMark,"Crazy shot
"
GhostifiedMark,Lol I love this
GhostifiedMark,"You don't think this place would get people to be more knowledgeable about the sport?

GhostifiedMark,I know Harden is notorious for getting to the line a lot but goddamn don't just ignore him
GhostifiedMark,"Man when Teague is bad, the hawks don't look good. I may be wrong but I really think Teague's penetration junpstarts their offense.

It doesn't help that the Wizards have kept Korver in check "
GhostifiedMark,I thought Mike Breen said 5?
GhostifiedMark,ROFL refs trolling 
GhostifiedMark,"Fuck ESPN

Not even for their announcers...this fucking static "

GhostifiedMark,"Welp OKC got the first pick

It's the shirt guys"
GhostifiedMark,Fucking nice
GhostifiedMark,The korver we all wanted to see
GhostifiedMark,"According to this thread, seems like I missed a bad song"
GhostifiedMark,"Oh yeah I remember

Idk how the reception was on here but on the comments of the hang time blog on nba.com, there was a lot of upset Lakers fans lol"
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Wendy's have created a commercial where they grouped all the most annoying types of people this world has created

GhostifiedMark,Crazy shot
GhostifiedMark,Lol what the hell Shaq

GhostifiedMark,Heat check
GhostifiedMark,Might make this game crazier 
GhostifiedMark,"Amazing series

I really hope Paul can be good to go for the Rockets "
GhostifiedMark,Mavs can't even play D and Blazers after Wes Mathews injury was just sad to watch. 
GhostifiedMark,I mean he got the guy ejected so he did something right 
GhostifiedMark,"It was a dumb foul

"
GhostifiedMark,Isn't he good from 3?
GhostifiedMark,I'm ready for this

GhostifiedMark,I thought he was joking 
GhostifiedMark,Balmer: JAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
GhostifiedMark,It looked so bad when they desperately looked for him for a quick 3
GhostifiedMark,...wait does Gentry know this?
GhostifiedMark,"I never said it was a bad thing. I actually agree with you

Still gives me a little chuckle though "
GhostifiedMark,But you brought it up
GhostifiedMark,"...43 points in a quarter

I'm quite concerned that this team won't have fans at the arena for the next game "
GhostifiedMark,I do have a mark on my forehead so it must mean something 
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Christ this sub is just shitting on the hawks
GhostifiedMark,Teague goddamn

GhostifiedMark,Lol damn Horford
GhostifiedMark,"i would try this but then i'd have to get a girlfriend

"
GhostifiedMark,"oh wow

That reminds me of when Jordan jacked up the 3 when they fouled him and they didn't give it to him"
GhostifiedMark,I don't know I'm on the fence
GhostifiedMark,That's the spirit
GhostifiedMark,Lol damn that almost went in
GhostifiedMark,It's so sad man... Such an amazing player but has this stigma against him for not even reaching the WCF
GhostifiedMark,"DOWN GOES JOEY

DOWN GOES JOEY"
GhostifiedMark,What a bad foul
GhostifiedMark,I missed this cause my step dad wouldn't fucking change the channel...ugh
GhostifiedMark,Welp...
GhostifiedMark,Lol why is Pau asking for a foul
GhostifiedMark,"I don't know...I kinda find that hard to believe. Its been shown every time that any writer is willing to make an article out of whatever controversial crap that this place finds. And it annoys me to no end that people constantly do it with no regard to the person's public image.

"
GhostifiedMark,It's the only reasonable explanation
GhostifiedMark,That's it
GhostifiedMark,I was wondering why Blatt hasn't called any timeouts to stop this drought but he doesn't have enough 
GhostifiedMark,HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERS
GhostifiedMark,What? He tried to take a swipe at the ball but he couldn't reach it
GhostifiedMark,"Holy shit Okafor kinda looks like Tim Duncan

But his voice is deeper

Lol what a world"
GhostifiedMark,That announcer guy sounds more enthusiastic
GhostifiedMark,I thought so cause of the random PR-like answers with basketball and whatnot (not saying he doesn't like the game but it came off weird)
GhostifiedMark,Udidit
GhostifiedMark,Yeesh did TNT mistakingly put Doc's voice on air?
GhostifiedMark,Poor Horford...looks bad for him
GhostifiedMark,Lol goddamn Bogut
GhostifiedMark,What the fuck was that
GhostifiedMark,Lol I'm sure coaches love his throwback 50s form 
GhostifiedMark,lol I could tell Tony Allen don't like wearing suits
GhostifiedMark,Hey thanks 
GhostifiedMark,Wow that second gif... He looks like Bane that just wouldn't quit in his old years
GhostifiedMark,Have they reposted her other drawings? 
GhostifiedMark,"Didn't even notice the wrong placement  of the apostrophe 

Thanks"
GhostifiedMark,I didn't realize that Mark Jackson ruined a bad ass quote
GhostifiedMark,Gonna have to go to auto zone after seeing that dunk
GhostifiedMark,It must be stressful being a clips fan
GhostifiedMark,"Harden: go show dem east fuckbois how it's done

Steph: all year baby

Lebron: fellas....sharpen the daggers

*Jones, Delly, Smith, Miller, Shumpert, and Irving proceed to knock down back to back 3s*"
GhostifiedMark,Lol this is so like the Hawks/Wizards game 
GhostifiedMark,"Lol how is this a good argument. Noah isn't in jail for shitting on Cleveland. He's not being restricted to say anything besides his PR telling him to watch what he says to the media (which isn't that relevant to this situation)

I swear people who use this argument have got to be the biggest bitches when it comes to arguments. Can't take it when you're criticized? Muh 1st Amendment 
"
GhostifiedMark,He's played nice D on Harden all series
GhostifiedMark,He hates Harrison Barnes
GhostifiedMark,Pistons fans....if there are any here... What do you guys think of Josh Smith now? 
GhostifiedMark,"CP3 has been bad man

Skip Bayless is gonna have a field day on him"
GhostifiedMark,Its Harlan
GhostifiedMark,"Wow Dennis has been nice

Jeff Teague has to worry for his starting position "
GhostifiedMark,i love this post but i don't think posting it here will be beneficial since comments on game threads tend to fly by
GhostifiedMark,"Well look at it this way, when you poop you won't feel it anymore"
GhostifiedMark,We all friends here
GhostifiedMark,"....this is nothing similar to what's happening in the gif. You just met another asshole and in the gif, it was after the game and the lady was doing her job."
GhostifiedMark,Oh god seeing Livingston buckle down like that scared the hell outta me
GhostifiedMark,"With the night he's having, I still believe he would have made it"
GhostifiedMark,Lol Delly almost held the guy's leg but let go immediately 
GhostifiedMark,Disturbing pic
GhostifiedMark,"There were a lot of injuries in this year's playoffs and I heard a lot of opposing crowds cheering

Who would've thought that the team that this subs crucifies the most would have been the most respectful "
GhostifiedMark,Yeah....no
GhostifiedMark,Lebron forgot he's not 29
GhostifiedMark,My god
GhostifiedMark,"thats what i'm worried about

After Carroll...who's left to keep Lebron in check? "
GhostifiedMark,Flo is harsh
GhostifiedMark,I don't know why but I always forget that he's a good defender
GhostifiedMark,i mean if he can't beat superman than i wouldn't call him a god
GhostifiedMark,For their sake I hope it doesn't happen
GhostifiedMark,"oh i never knew that

i thought he made it to start up his own website and ESPN saw it and offered to team up or whatever"
GhostifiedMark,"Lol ""you working dare downvote me"""
GhostifiedMark,:( I laughed 
GhostifiedMark,Idk people still say he's one of the greatest
GhostifiedMark,[You don't say](https://youtu.be/V-fRuoMIfpw)
GhostifiedMark,Lol I'm glad someone noticed it
GhostifiedMark,Guess I'm in that weird situation where I disagree with his decision 
GhostifiedMark,"that was my first reaction

"
GhostifiedMark,"Idk seeing Nene and Noah compete for ""who's fucking up the team the most"" award is funny to me"
GhostifiedMark,"Lmao Mike Tricio

""Woo"""
GhostifiedMark,Lol refs gave a foul to the warriors just to appease their hunger 
GhostifiedMark,Reminds me of the nuggets
GhostifiedMark,I mean there is that pic of LeBron walking around and Windhorst is nearby
GhostifiedMark,stretches the floor i guess
GhostifiedMark,Lmao Doc
GhostifiedMark,[reminded me of this](https://youtu.be/V9vft6tXI1g)
GhostifiedMark,John Wall looks like he owns a car dealership 
GhostifiedMark,Our league's MVP
GhostifiedMark,Who hurt him? Lebron
GhostifiedMark,"Kendrick, yeah. I forgot I had him on my list.

DOOM..he's popular underground rapper. I think any person who's invested into hip hop will have at least heard the name 

As for Mick, I disagree. He only got noise last year for the mixtape but that's it. I don't really hear his music on any mainstream medium."
GhostifiedMark,....lm... *is unsure whether it'll get me downvoted*...ao? 
GhostifiedMark,"If you see a guy in the post or taking a bunch of jab steps, its lebron "
GhostifiedMark,"-Noah leaves man for double team

GhostifiedMark,"well i just learned where the ""dominate -insert random thing-"" joke came from"
GhostifiedMark,Lol Chuck
GhostifiedMark,It was like a dolphin spinning in the air
GhostifiedMark,Explains Manu and Lebron
GhostifiedMark,"In some ways, this is really similar to my nightmares"
GhostifiedMark,"Lol delete your comment. You don't have to join the downside train with me

I just thought the series would have been more competitive if both teams were healthy but I guess this game thread disagrees. Oh well"
GhostifiedMark,lol this is creepy
GhostifiedMark,Blake remembered that this is an important game
GhostifiedMark,Can't wait for the western fans to complain about this offensive drought
GhostifiedMark,"Lol this guy

GhostifiedMark,What a pass from lebron 
GhostifiedMark,Lol Trillsap
GhostifiedMark,"This is me with Bradley Beal in the regular season

As for Korver ...dude could not miss man"
GhostifiedMark,Lol it's hilarious
GhostifiedMark,Did you forget that this is the conference finals? 
GhostifiedMark,"Mike Breen: Luke Walton!

JVG and MJax: *silence*

Me: lol"
GhostifiedMark,"I come home and see the score

Me: aw man the game is done

Harlan: AND WE END THE THIRD QUARTER-

Me: what the fuck did he say...Jesus Christ  "
GhostifiedMark,really? he hasn't said much imo
GhostifiedMark,Holy shit
GhostifiedMark,"Lol when I heard Reggie say ""Lebron is now 9 of 61..."", I almost lost it"
GhostifiedMark,"...
You're still in the same position

Harden isn't even having a good playoff series"
GhostifiedMark,A little 
GhostifiedMark,Really? 
GhostifiedMark,I have a hard time imagining that this will affect you deeply for the next game 
GhostifiedMark,I can't imagine how these guys dealt with that type of pressure 
GhostifiedMark,he has a sister?
GhostifiedMark,MARC GASOL
GhostifiedMark,they didn't even bother to run him off the 3 point line
GhostifiedMark,Lol when something bad happens to the Bulls Thibs have such a disgusted face 
GhostifiedMark,I really like those bounce passes Lebron pulls off
GhostifiedMark,Lol that's a nasty jumper Thompson 
GhostifiedMark,Funny vid
GhostifiedMark,Was that really his fault? He threw it to an open Ariza but he started cutting to the basket. 
GhostifiedMark,I wanna see the graphs he used
GhostifiedMark,Wait what?  Rockets ball
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn Blake
GhostifiedMark,"....

GhostifiedMark,Playoff Ridick : I can make everything besides 3s
GhostifiedMark,Is Memphis really that bad of a 3pt shooting team?

GhostifiedMark,THE HACKING BATTLE CONTINUES 
GhostifiedMark,Oh Barnes..don't put your hand there
GhostifiedMark,Pixels...I might watch that
GhostifiedMark,i think shaq legitimately fell and the studio decided to cash in on this situation
GhostifiedMark,That was 80s night right?
GhostifiedMark,I don't think he's dirty but that was suspicious 
GhostifiedMark,i could see him doing this just to get as much time to set up his offense without using timeouts
GhostifiedMark,Jesus literally no guards went back
GhostifiedMark,24-9 run
GhostifiedMark,"Considering that when the other injuries that have happened in the plays ended up with cheers from opposing fans, this is a breath of fresh air"

GhostifiedMark,Dat veteran experience 
GhostifiedMark,JR Smith...

GhostifiedMark,This is no better than getting dumped via text
GhostifiedMark,Well shit
GhostifiedMark,Pau looks weird man. He always looks dead and tired but then he gets a double double
GhostifiedMark,Its those damn dark corners huh?
GhostifiedMark,I guess not all Reddit apps give you the ability to see flairs
GhostifiedMark,I kinda wanna see this cause I might laugh 
GhostifiedMark,I think them protecting Dunleavy's dirty antics but getting all riled up over Delly is a better thing to mention.
GhostifiedMark,Damn you thought Scott Brooks was safe?... Actually I could see why. I thought the injuries would delay his firing but the GM didn't wait
GhostifiedMark,Barnes is deceptively quick 
GhostifiedMark,HE DID IT
GhostifiedMark,This is my first time seeing Mayweather talk and I'm shocked... My friend (he's not a boxing fan) has told me that this guy is an egomaniacal jackass...

Seriously man this guy will kill hopes and dreams

*Lebron misses 3*

Opponents: WE HAVE A CHANCE

*TT gets board, passes it out to Lebron and he makes game winner*

Opponents: sigh.."
GhostifiedMark,"I don't think his Xs and Os are all that...I've only seen PnR for lobs to Howard, post up for their bigs, and Harden to drive and create for himself, others, or layups/drawing fouls"
GhostifiedMark,Lol big baby couldn't stay in the air too long
GhostifiedMark,So no gif of Davis reaction to his first jumper?
GhostifiedMark,They did the same play twice 
GhostifiedMark,Lol I'm surprised no one is talking about it
GhostifiedMark,OH SHIT
GhostifiedMark,Lock down every other player and let Lebron beat you
GhostifiedMark,yeesh if the warriors win the ring then Lebron giving Steph the torch is pretty much fate
GhostifiedMark,Lol the ref blew the whistle waited till everyone looked at him and then made the call
GhostifiedMark,I just realized that Charles Barkley was right...rockets won

GhostifiedMark,PAU STAHP
GhostifiedMark,"Am I the only one who thinks that both teams are displaying some poor transition defense?
"
GhostifiedMark,I honestly think your team needs a diaw type player. I think Paul Millsap tries to be that kind of player but his ball handling skills is suspect imo
GhostifiedMark,"I really wanted Chris Paul to reach far in the playoffs

"
GhostifiedMark,Lol amazing
GhostifiedMark,Imagine if Clippers had a bench
GhostifiedMark,Damn Nene 
GhostifiedMark,Lol Clippers have to stop disrespecting Josh Smith's 3 point shot

GhostifiedMark,"Nikola: YES I GOT LEBRON

GhostifiedMark,I'm sure most people have a hate boner for Sandler so you're gonna be get downvoted
GhostifiedMark,OMG Crawford stop... 
GhostifiedMark,"Its a foul but learn from the Rockets/Clippers series

Looking for fouls ain't gonna cut it"
GhostifiedMark,Idk why Jimmy Butler bothers with tightening his shorts. His shirt will come loose regardless
GhostifiedMark,something something kendrick
GhostifiedMark,They wanna get him going?
GhostifiedMark,"&gt; :))))))))))

Whenever I see this I think of a person with many chins"

"
GhostifiedMark,crawford stop my god
GhostifiedMark,If you want to depend on Shaun Livingston for heavy minutes be my guest
GhostifiedMark,Marv is so surprised that Dellavedova has 2 3s
GhostifiedMark,"If Blake had longer arms I think he'll be a better ball handler

I mean he's fine but whenever he's pushing a fast break I feel like he's always dipping a little just so he won't dribble it off his foot"
GhostifiedMark,HE'S 4/4?!?!?!
GhostifiedMark,"Lol when in doubt

Hack"
GhostifiedMark,"Well...eh...

I mean I think Blake has more moves but it always looks wonky to me because of his short arms"
GhostifiedMark,I hope so
GhostifiedMark,Lol damn every shot Korver takes there's a foul
GhostifiedMark,That's sad
GhostifiedMark,No it wasn't . It was a 3 on 2 favoring the warriors 
GhostifiedMark,"I sometimes think that besides rockets fans, this sub doesn't know how good the rockets are

"
GhostifiedMark,"No doubt but it's not like Teague was good this post season

Wall is just making or worse for the Hawks"
GhostifiedMark,"It's weird that I knew he was gonna make that

This team makes demoralizing shots man"

Noah: I've always been booed

GhostifiedMark,I thought they said finals
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn Crawford 
GhostifiedMark,lol i can hear Giannis saying this
GhostifiedMark,Lol you'll get downvoted but I laughed

GhostifiedMark,Jesus there are more Steph Currys? 
GhostifiedMark,Rofl Harden
GhostifiedMark,"JJ ""I only make threes when they are important"" Redick"
GhostifiedMark,I can't believe I haven't seen more clippers fans pissed at Crawford 
GhostifiedMark,If Clippers win what are the chances that Doc won't get credit for his performance this series?
GhostifiedMark,Lol if that went in
GhostifiedMark,I thought it was a charge 
GhostifiedMark,That black mask lebron had was so bad ass
GhostifiedMark,"Get ready for ""you ungrateful fuck"" comments"
GhostifiedMark,"Omg

It's uncanny"
GhostifiedMark,if that happens...would the history books say that Durant was drafted by the Sonics but then traded to OKC?
GhostifiedMark,i knew he was born in akron but the same hospital? crazy
GhostifiedMark,Lol Bazemore
GhostifiedMark,Probably Thibs muffled screams
GhostifiedMark,holy shit is that true?
GhostifiedMark,I'm not saying his left eye is blind but his depth perception isn't off a little bit?
GhostifiedMark,Your team let those rec league chumps get a 14 point lead 
GhostifiedMark,Holy Shit that was a nice block
GhostifiedMark,Well I didn't expect this
GhostifiedMark,They were seriously calling a sweep? I thought everyone thought this would go to 7
GhostifiedMark,Lol its shit on lebron day even though what he said was as harmless as a baby with a toy rattle
GhostifiedMark,Lmao 
GhostifiedMark,"Most of these guys are

Chris Webber immediately pointed out the mismatch Mozgov had on Rose but completely disregarded Kyrie's ability to get around his man...and he did

"
GhostifiedMark,Nasty dribbling 
GhostifiedMark,"idk...i think those two aren't good post defenders to begin with

Duncan is great don't get me wrong"

GhostifiedMark,Shout out to the ref who ran the quick hard left to catch Aarons pass
GhostifiedMark,"....I need to see that block again. I don't think he touched it. If he did, that is really close to goaltending"
GhostifiedMark,lol Nene
GhostifiedMark,I wouldn't count on ZBO to get a loose ball tbh
GhostifiedMark,LOL did he just do a split?
GhostifiedMark,A fully healthy Hawks squad vs a fully healthy Cavs squad would have been quite the sight 
GhostifiedMark,Really?
GhostifiedMark,Sorry but I'm tired of this Powerade commercial 
GhostifiedMark,Is that Tyler Ennis?
GhostifiedMark,"The crowd don't even cheer when Noah gets a rebound 

Its just sad watching him try "
GhostifiedMark,Well if he did there would be a turnover so..no..
GhostifiedMark,Didn't Lebron say that this year he's not expecting to get a ring? I know he did that so he won't repeat what he said last time but i think it some merit
GhostifiedMark,"Blake has been incredible in the post season

The WCF finals will be a crazy one "
GhostifiedMark,Wooooow
GhostifiedMark,I mean with no context yeah its weird

At the same time I don't think Delly tried to undercut anyone

GhostifiedMark,"Damn he thought he was broadcasting the Lakers

And wtf Hawes"
GhostifiedMark,"Lol damn I knew there was some bulls fans that have been so disappointed with Joakim but I didn't expect that. I can see why people might like his behavior but this sub sometimes blur line between ""passion"" and just being an asshole. I personally don't mind it but eh...

And this is unrelated but your post reminded of the times I've seen Noah mutter to himself when he fucks up a play lol."
GhostifiedMark,Only on Giannis

GhostifiedMark,Nah there's a troll downvoting everybody 
GhostifiedMark,"Can't believe people actually think Horford tried to go for Delly's head with an elbow. Dude was falling over and moved his arm cause Delly was under him. At the same time I don't think Delly had any ulterior motives to get rid of players by going after legs. Plus he tripped over Carroll. 

If anything, you call a flagrant foul on Horford for holding onto Delly's arm. 
"
GhostifiedMark,Lee called bank
GhostifiedMark,GODDAMN
GhostifiedMark,Did he have a beard in Utah?
GhostifiedMark,Lol he won him over when he saw Whiteside triple double 
GhostifiedMark,ROFL 
GhostifiedMark,McHale basically did what you're suggesting
GhostifiedMark,I would agree but this isn't just one game 
GhostifiedMark,Can someone tell me why weeds are such a problem for a gardener?
GhostifiedMark,You could live with Dennis shooting 3s
GhostifiedMark,This is just sad
GhostifiedMark,Name checks out
GhostifiedMark,Sounds familiar 
GhostifiedMark,This... This is quite alarming
GhostifiedMark,You must be a dick at thanksgiving dinners
GhostifiedMark,Jesus harden
GhostifiedMark,Uh oh....3s are falling 
GhostifiedMark,"Harden is running a step back mid range clinic

Got curry on skates "
GhostifiedMark,Why is shaq pissed?
GhostifiedMark,Eh you can go watch it for yourself but imo it won't be a lasting memory. I agree with your comment on the Dark Knight trilogy even though they don't end it so strongly
GhostifiedMark,Yeah man and if the warriors can put the ball in the basket all the time they can win this game
GhostifiedMark,Probably. You'll have a shit load of DMC haters
GhostifiedMark,Savage
GhostifiedMark,Lol what is even happening in this gif
GhostifiedMark,"Why did Doc stick with Barnes on Harden..i'm not even a clippers fan and i got mad at that shit

Only JJ Redick and CP should handle Harden...its almost laughable that down the stretch that Redick had to cover fucking jason terry"
GhostifiedMark,"I'm not even a clippers fan and this guy frustrates me

Jesus what a chucker "
GhostifiedMark,"*ESPN shows Curry's parents*

Me: that's their parents

Step-dad: that's his wife? 

Me: no that their parents"
GhostifiedMark,Does Mchale want all his forwards to post up or something? 
GhostifiedMark,Looks like I missed a dagger
GhostifiedMark,"Its ok Tony Allen
"
GhostifiedMark,"""dad why do you always talk to these people? and why does the fat one hate me?"""
GhostifiedMark,Why hasn't Muscala seen the floor
GhostifiedMark,Lol bulls you're disappointing my step dad
GhostifiedMark,And Warriors is back
GhostifiedMark,Tony Allen is gonna say his mantra to Jeff Green
GhostifiedMark,Idk man..Spencer Hawes isn't exactly a rim protector
GhostifiedMark,Damn Klay what was that
GhostifiedMark,Damn they're only down by 5
GhostifiedMark,Its cause females don't care unless they're involved /s
GhostifiedMark,Dang that's a lot
GhostifiedMark,Clock manager strikes again
GhostifiedMark,I still find it funny
GhostifiedMark,Maybe Pat Beverly had a big impact 
GhostifiedMark,Wow one comment against the warriors and he's salty?
GhostifiedMark,"lol Baron Davis is like ""aight you got me"""
GhostifiedMark,"Mike Breen: performance of the night by the Navy

*shows Kyrie jogging*

Me: lol"
GhostifiedMark,"Jamal Crawford...gotta live and die by him

*looks at rules*

*4. NO Emma Watson GIFS, lets keep her sacred.*

Me: Jesus Christ "
GhostifiedMark,"To be fair, at the time it's not like they were seeing and-1 players doing crazy shit"
GhostifiedMark,Lol what was that Lebron? 
GhostifiedMark,Lol omg I can see it
GhostifiedMark,Sounds sad
GhostifiedMark,I feel like Howard always performs in the playoffs...I'm probably wrong though 
GhostifiedMark,Why a tech on teague?
GhostifiedMark,It's the face for me..
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Christ this is real
GhostifiedMark,Uh OK? 
GhostifiedMark,This sub annoys me when they make out of context threads like this
GhostifiedMark,I mean their in the top ten right?
GhostifiedMark,Lol Bud calm down
GhostifiedMark,Didn't Stevenson get a tech for doing that? 
GhostifiedMark,"I heard Mike Tricio so I thought Hubie was with him

Jesus Christ Jon Barry "
GhostifiedMark,I actually have lol
GhostifiedMark,Muscala gambles too much
GhostifiedMark,Why wait? 
GhostifiedMark,Wowwww
GhostifiedMark,Cavs fans: LOWE SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP
GhostifiedMark,What a bullshit call
GhostifiedMark,What a beast
GhostifiedMark,Come on now
GhostifiedMark,Idk taking a charge from lebron might hurt
GhostifiedMark,Dear lord the Hawks wings just got clipped 
GhostifiedMark,Shump hit the rim
GhostifiedMark,"Lol Jalen

""He shouldn't even know that guys name""

Baynes man...he always gets shitted on"
GhostifiedMark,Salesperson: got you fam
GhostifiedMark,Don't they know that Jesus is in San Antonio
GhostifiedMark,what the hell Wittman tried to do there
GhostifiedMark,"Warriors fans you can blame my sister for this

She's never watched one game of the warriors and she became a fan of them yesterday while calling a sweep for this series"
GhostifiedMark,A common misconception. We are actually translucent.
GhostifiedMark,Another Terminator? 
GhostifiedMark,"So I explained to my step dad why DJ keeps getting fouled

We both shared a laugh "
GhostifiedMark,What the hell. What's with the Star Wars characters 
GhostifiedMark,I think Harden blocked Austin Rivers
GhostifiedMark,Pierce isnt really good on D
GhostifiedMark,"Damn it

I took a few bites but then I felt weird so I threw it away"
GhostifiedMark,"Bad News Blake

Lol I kinda like it"
GhostifiedMark,I think both are bad tbh
GhostifiedMark,Jesus he got over Gasol
GhostifiedMark,This game is slow man...lol the ball casually rolled to Antic and no one did anything 
GhostifiedMark,Kerr making his best /r/nba knee jerk reaction impression 
GhostifiedMark,Jamal stahp
GhostifiedMark,"""I HATE ESPN, NO CONTENT WHATSOEVER"" -/r/nba"
GhostifiedMark,"BANG

IT'S OVER"
GhostifiedMark,I'm in tears
GhostifiedMark,This is horrible defense wtf
GhostifiedMark,"i mean...there was an open player in the corner and Korver had to leave Gortat to close out

2&gt;3"
GhostifiedMark,"Jesus Christ man

Dammit clippers add depth for next year"
GhostifiedMark,....oh my god 
GhostifiedMark,"Warriors paying homage to the Clippers

And lol Harden just blocked green "
GhostifiedMark,Idk Coach Nick might love it
GhostifiedMark,Lol Byron Scott's face
GhostifiedMark,Another 3
GhostifiedMark,I like the plays the clippers played down the stretch to try to cut the lead.  Four players on the perimeter and left either Griffin or Jordan for a quick layup.  
GhostifiedMark,Are we talking about Pierce or Noah
GhostifiedMark,Wowowowow
GhostifiedMark,"Don't bother James, Tony Brothers don't give a fuck"
GhostifiedMark,Assuming the wizards will let it happen
GhostifiedMark,"Schröder looks like he doesn't have eyebrows but lo and behold, they're there"
GhostifiedMark,My god JR
GhostifiedMark,"Lol I can't stand RA the rugged man..don't ask me why...there's just something about him that puts me off.  Plus some of his fans are some pretentious fucks. Same breed as Lupe stans

I don't have any problems with the rest of the artists you mentioned. I actually think they are ridiculous lyricists but I just never like their ear for beats. "
GhostifiedMark,Lol Matt Barnes
GhostifiedMark,I'm in tears lol
GhostifiedMark,A PLOT TWIST
GhostifiedMark,"Plead guilty to assault and battery charges...In 1997

I'm sure he's done his time"
GhostifiedMark,"....

Welp you've ruined this for me. "
GhostifiedMark,Jesus Marco
GhostifiedMark,"Yeah

"
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn Dunleavy
GhostifiedMark,Hacking has gotten so bad that DJ doesn't even get back with the team on offense..he has to stay back 
GhostifiedMark,well that must have been a good night for you guys
GhostifiedMark,lol the guy in the second vid is losing it
GhostifiedMark,"Well this explains why Allen kept shooting 3s

I was wondering wtf was happening"
GhostifiedMark,that mercury team last year was too OP
GhostifiedMark,"Clips fans would you want Jamal on your team next year?

"
GhostifiedMark,"I honestly thought a heat fan would say Bill Walker with the way he's shot this season.

I don't hate Napier but I gotta agree with you"
GhostifiedMark,"First Team all defense 

-Tony Allen"
GhostifiedMark,Crazy play
GhostifiedMark,"I think he wasn't because his name isn't very big

He, Millsap, and maybe Horford have been the only consistent player in the post season for the Hawks "
GhostifiedMark,"They don't lol

Sad part about this is that when he does give the warriors credit no one mentions it"
GhostifiedMark,Oh shit its a Hawes game
GhostifiedMark,Lol fuck Jason Terry
GhostifiedMark,What a save by Millsap
GhostifiedMark,I think he's getting an emmy
GhostifiedMark,"i have never seen anyone here celebrate ""vet moves"" "
GhostifiedMark,Wait didn't the ref blow the whistle and have the ball to the throw in man before the game clock expired?
GhostifiedMark,I've never paid for PPV but ...actually I'm sure the internet would just stream it so nvm
GhostifiedMark,So he went to tell the hawks bench good luck in the next round?
GhostifiedMark,"Why are people mad that Nene missed that layup in traffic (yeah it was a bad finish)

Beal and Wall were defended beautifully and I'm sure Nene running to the paint for a layup was their last option. He just didn't execute"
GhostifiedMark,I didn't even know you guys had him. I thought he was with the pistons 
GhostifiedMark,Whenever someone is talking about Deron Williams I always expect to see this comment
GhostifiedMark,I really have to ask the rockets sub how valuable was Pat Beverly to your team's defense and what made it sigh highly ranked....its just bad right now. I wish Ernie mentioned it cause Kenny and Chuck are just killing him whenever he mentions it. Its like the Wes Mathews situation and I can't understand it...how does losing one person affect your teams defense so much (its somewhat happening to the Hawks too)
GhostifiedMark,Sloppy start
GhostifiedMark,How is that on Horford?
GhostifiedMark,"What's with those fans on the front row

I feel like they're gonna hit the ref"
GhostifiedMark,Why didn't you just say Korra...The Legend of Korra isn't her name
GhostifiedMark,Are you serious?
GhostifiedMark,I second this
GhostifiedMark,Why is Harden on Blake anyways?
GhostifiedMark,I thought it was a troll down voting everybody 
GhostifiedMark,😳
GhostifiedMark,Moose 
GhostifiedMark,I mean..fuck him for getting caught up in a screen amirite?
GhostifiedMark,Lol Korver my god
GhostifiedMark,Doc playing one player per play
GhostifiedMark,Well damn Capella
GhostifiedMark,I can't imagine that ending well
GhostifiedMark,Lol Jeff Green 
GhostifiedMark,I didn't even know refs could control the clock 
GhostifiedMark,Delly on Brooks is not fair
GhostifiedMark,"I don't think so

I just saw happy grizz fans taking about the game"
GhostifiedMark,IT'S WORKING
GhostifiedMark,...I don't think Carroll had possession of the ball
GhostifiedMark,You tried
GhostifiedMark,What happened to that Tensho guy bulls fans?
GhostifiedMark,if it does then thats sad
GhostifiedMark,not a fan of typical pop music
GhostifiedMark,"Are you serious? I mean you could argue that the OF boys and Action Bronson are but that's it.

Edit: forgot to add Kendrick"
GhostifiedMark,Lol I didn't even notice 
GhostifiedMark,/r/shestillsucking
GhostifiedMark,They ran one in the beginning of the half and...well that was it
GhostifiedMark,its so crazy that it might just work
GhostifiedMark,I think Harden made that
GhostifiedMark,Lol he lost a bet
GhostifiedMark,Lmao Rivers has got to feel so smug right now 
GhostifiedMark,Goddamn bogut 
GhostifiedMark,Is McHale still hacking? I'm not at a TV right now
GhostifiedMark,"This was literally not an issue till this game

I'm not sure if people are just upset over the Bulls loss or if people are just being influenced by JVG"
GhostifiedMark,Warriors fans just enjoying this lol
GhostifiedMark,No...I don't need nightmares
GhostifiedMark,Manu was just giving Harden the gift of drawing fouls
GhostifiedMark,Lol it's official. My step dad hates Draymond Green
GhostifiedMark,This is like a troll Reddit comment on YouTube
GhostifiedMark,Omg lol
GhostifiedMark,Amazing
GhostifiedMark,I think Butler might be the best transition defender in the league right now 
GhostifiedMark,Lol Noah looks like fabulous
GhostifiedMark,Lol what did Wall do with his fingers?
GhostifiedMark,Its like you solved a 1000 puzzle and now you're just playing with a 20 piece set
GhostifiedMark,Lol people will call him a bitch for it but Lebron really knows how to handle himself. Immediately walks away from the situation if it gets too tense 
GhostifiedMark,Wow they've never lost 2 straight games at home? 
GhostifiedMark,now kith
GhostifiedMark,Korver's free throw form is like watching a martial artist slowly moving to perfect his form 
GhostifiedMark,"If JJ Redick can continue his D on Harden, Clippers can win this"
GhostifiedMark,"Mcnuggets are nasty though

The only thing I'd get from McD's is their cookies, frappe, and their breakfast sandwiches "
GhostifiedMark,I don't think Wittman has ever let a reporter finish their question 
GhostifiedMark,He's got worse handles
GhostifiedMark,"I think his twist with the horns set he's been running the whole series has been so good to CP3's success. It gives him room, it puts him in a comfortable position (he's money from mid range), it easily helps him penetrate the defense, and it easily slips into a side pick and roll with Blake (another play that is killing the spurs)

I wanna believe that Doc is stressing them to keep doing it cause its so effective."
GhostifiedMark,"i think i saw it before hand though

idk maybe my memory is shot"
GhostifiedMark,i'm not disagreeing with you but...how do you know?
GhostifiedMark,ZBO heard this game thread and fouled Curry out of kindness 
GhostifiedMark,"I agree

But I don't hate Nick Young...he's just there. Sometimes he makes me laugh, sometimes he doesn't"
GhostifiedMark,Lol that was the laziest flair screen I've ever seen 
GhostifiedMark,I don't think most people understand that aspect of referring tbh
GhostifiedMark,Cause he's winning? 
GhostifiedMark,Lol that's still a lot
GhostifiedMark,"It's cause people have such a hate boner for Harden that logic escapes them

Seriously it's crazy how people are complaining about this"
GhostifiedMark,"Mozgov is really lucky he didn't become a doctor

"
GhostifiedMark,You're lucky..
GhostifiedMark,The what
GhostifiedMark,OMG Klay
GhostifiedMark,I think among heat fans there are people who like Juwon Howard and others who don't care much for him
GhostifiedMark,.....oh Reggie..
GhostifiedMark,"Hmm I forgot tomorrow is Memorial Day so of won't have to miss the game

Thanks anyways"
GhostifiedMark,"Wow I'm just now noticing Mike Breen's age

"
GhostifiedMark,How different are the rules on timeouts between Europe and here?
GhostifiedMark,Doc learned too much from Pop
GhostifiedMark,Nah just tired
GhostifiedMark,Wow they got it
GhostifiedMark,This is some bad d
GhostifiedMark,lol my god
GhostifiedMark,I'm sorry
GhostifiedMark,Ouch
GhostifiedMark,Lol how'd you mix up Teague with Dennis
GhostifiedMark,What is OJ doing?
GhostifiedMark,What?
GhostifiedMark,"Wow I thought it was goaltending

Amazing block"
GhostifiedMark,I mean Lebron can't survive forever
GhostifiedMark,Lol there was a user who said Memphis was the ultimate pretender 
GhostifiedMark,I'm neutral 
GhostifiedMark,"Seraphin and Otto are looking like TT

Its bad enough that the Hawks are small"
GhostifiedMark,I had a pair...I regret it everyday 
GhostifiedMark,Lol damn
GhostifiedMark,So did Nene and Gortat switch places?
GhostifiedMark,And then he drains a jumper
GhostifiedMark,Time was running down and for some reason none of the bigs wanted to set a pick for him
GhostifiedMark,"I'm sure you know by now, but CP3 injured"
GhostifiedMark,Wtf is up with the rims
GhostifiedMark,"He's living up to the typical angry android user stereotype

I love android but man these people make us look like victimized dicks"
GhostifiedMark,The headband is back
GhostifiedMark,Holy shit Nene
GhostifiedMark,You monster
GhostifiedMark,The playoffs this year has given me a new appreciation for Doc Rivers. It also has shown me that Star Wars characters are Rockets fans and that Jesus came back just to be a Spurs fan 
GhostifiedMark,So how did the Clips score 43 points in the third quarter?
GhostifiedMark,It may be too late but I have 6 bucks and some change in my pocket so what do I buy to eat for this amazing game
KabirC,"&gt; So since January 15th (right after the cavs got mozgov, shump, and JR) the cavs are 45-9 in games that LeBron plays (he sat out 2)

"
KabirC,Klaystation 4 is on
KabirC,"Klay's off again, god damn it Klay, you aren't even tired from defense."
KabirC,Steph Curry.
KabirC,That was terrible transition defense 
KabirC,"Julie Phayer @juliephayer 

Steph getting ""overrated"" chants. LOL."
KabirC,"Scored on, no he fouled Steph."
KabirC,"Jonathan Feigen ‏@Jonathan_Feigen  

Kerr picks up a T. Joey got him during time out.

Fuck you Joey, screwing up this game"
KabirC,"Game isn't over, but it was the Anthony Davis effect. He affected a lot of transition shots because of his length and athleticism and then the Pelicans could knock down 3s a lot better."
KabirC,Damn Dray
KabirC,"Want to complain about Josh Smith handchecking Steph too? There is stuff everywhere that isn't called, stop complaining."
KabirC,"That's not how basketball works lol, entire game changes. Momentum and the events afterwards"
KabirC,"Damn, didn't realize that Klay's wingspan is only 6'8. Andre and HB are both at 7' and that definitely helps when contesting the step back."
KabirC,What's with incompetent clock operators? How the hell is the NBA having this problem in the playoffs
KabirC,Joey Crawford...
KabirC,"It's Scott Foster, he's terrible"
KabirC,"Because Draymond has been killing him positionally, Gasol hasn't gotten in the low post very often when he's tried to back down Draymond."
KabirC,Rockets happy with the refs now that you're getting calls?
KabirC,Did the Raptors play the Wizard all in the beginning of the season before their collapse? Amazing how different of a team they were.
KabirC,Yup that there were
KabirC,Harrison Barnes is the complete opposite of the last 2 games
KabirC,Warriors have had like 7 or 8 wide open shots they've bricked and only made like 2 wide open shots.
KabirC,Why wouldn't you just shoot the Golden Gate Bridge emoji?
KabirC,"LOL, he almost made that shit"
KabirC,"Dirty, no. Cheap, yes."
KabirC,He is ass on defense right now and he's taking stupid shots. He needs to sit right now to get his head in the game
KabirC,"Andre, stop fucking shooting 3s"
KabirC,"I'm scared of that happening, Josh Smith getting a sliver of confidence."
KabirC,"Can't hold that obviously, they aren't calling it as long as you don't hug him and get him in the air."
KabirC,0-100 by Drake
KabirC,"It's been reported many places, has been all year."
KabirC,"That was an obvious travel, refs what the fuck?"
KabirC,11-12 from that corner
KabirC,"Even when he's got playing time, he has no shot anymore. His touch is gone, but that's probably because of playing time."
KabirC,God damn it refs
KabirC,"Warriors started the game chucking 3s, and ended up going down 19-3 when their shots weren't dropping but the Rockets couldn't miss."
KabirC,Warriors use a lot more of Andre on Harden so Klay isn't tired on offense and gets it going. Will probably go back to putting Klay on Harden once he has his confidence going.
KabirC,Looking much more relaxed
KabirC,Threw Livingston back
KabirC,This game is about to get crazy chippy now.
KabirC,I CALLED GAME! - THE TRUTH
KabirC,All good
KabirC,"How can you not love Wall's enthusiasm from the bench, awesome to see!"
KabirC,Warriors in 4
KabirC,"Scott Foster is one of the worst refs in the NBA, being magnified these playoffs."
KabirC,"Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83  

Ron Adams has beard clippings on his hands."
KabirC,http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33o3fi/absolutely_shameless_flop_from_draymond_includes
KabirC,How was that not a foul? Iggy got gut checked
KabirC,Rockets have a much worse chance to beat the Warriors.
KabirC,No.
KabirC,"Livingston got pushed on that, but no complaints right now."
KabirC,"If it was a flagrant 2, he would have been suspended because he has flagrant points."
KabirC,"Good looks so far for the Warriors, need to hit"
KabirC,"No, just /u/rabsho"
KabirC,"Steph never got hot in this game though. When you're looking at it, they finally started to make some open looks, offense still had 21 turnovers, but they capitalized on the open looks they got, unlike in games 2 and 3."
KabirC,"Yeah, he hits at 37%, but the max he hit in any one game this season was 3 and he only takes like 2 3s a game. "
KabirC,Koufos and Calathes are completely useless tonight
KabirC,Because you guys are playing terribly? I don't know
KabirC,Joey Crawford in full effect
KabirC,Dwight stepped out there
KabirC,HUGE foul disparity
KabirC,Klay had to heat check that 
KabirC,"No chance that's all it will take. There's still CP3 on his team who the voters view as more important than Blake right now. Plus, the Clippers don't have the bench to get a #1 seed"
KabirC,"Stupid turnover, come on D-Lee. "
KabirC,"He's got a long way to go still, he is the best shooter of all time, but he's got a way to go to become the greatest anything. Needs longevity and awards. "
KabirC,Goble called a foul he didn't see lol
KabirC,"Conley's grabbing on for dear life.

https://twitter.com/LetsGoWarriors/status/597198312299696128"
KabirC,"There isn't one, no one who has his ability to shoot off the dribble like he does"
KabirC,Barnes' crossover just froze Z-Bo.
KabirC,"There isn't one, LeBron was pushing through the screen."
KabirC,Ariza is putting a hand on Klay on every shot 
KabirC,"Shump would be on Klay, they won't put LeBron on Klay since Klay runs off the ball way too much."
KabirC,Only would be last 2 minutes if the game is within 5. Wish they actually did it for the game.
KabirC,Great defense Andre
KabirC,"Yes, the way they are done on some soccer jerseys are really nice. But unfortunately, they will have both ads on uniforms and TV timeouts."
KabirC,"Yup, they won't call it though, have to take advantage of it where you can"
KabirC,"Off the ball TA has made a lot of mistakes this series, one guy on Twitter had like 4 or 5 of them from Game 1. Klay had 3 or 4 open shots he missed running off the ball. If TA has you on the ball, not much you're going to do. But can definitely get open off the ball"
KabirC,"I'm worried about injuries. Refs aren't keeping this in control, if we have a suspension because of some BS like that."
KabirC,We rocked them when they had Howard too though
KabirC,"That's just embarrassing, what the hell is he doing."
KabirC,"Steph is missing every shot, this is ridiculous."
KabirC,You're about to get downvoted to hell in this thread
KabirC,FTs are 17-3 for the Grizz so far
KabirC,"In the season he shot like 64% or around there, he's as good at finishing as there is in the NBA"
KabirC,"Guys play on worse injuries than that, they'll just take some pain killers and get a cortisone shot. "
KabirC,Someone's theory of his sleeves getting shorter is very true lol
KabirC,"Clear path fouls never make sense, they call it sometimes they don't call it other times. "
KabirC,"That was terrible, foul on Lee and Curry that were ignored. Easy 2 for Memphis"
KabirC,Klay has had no BB IQ for this game and last game
KabirC,Shooting 55% would make the strategy statistically ineffective.
KabirC,"I worded it badly, need to sign Dray first and then would need to see from there what the rest of the situation is."
KabirC,"They tried to double Harden for some strange reason, but it wasn't a full double."
KabirC,KLAY SUPERNOVA TIME!
KabirC,"Fast Break ‏@GSWFastBreak  

Dwight Howard has a few words for Tony Brothers on the way back to the huddle."
KabirC,"They don't call those in the paint at all, Dwight does it plenty of times."
KabirC,Z-Bo just pushed Klay down for that easy basket.
KabirC,Harden crying for a foul
KabirC,What's with SA fans crying throughout this thread? 
KabirC,"Our shooting isn't on, defense is swarming and we finally put Andre on Harden. And we aren't turning the ball over"
KabirC,Over the back much?
KabirC,HELL YEAH!!!! WE'VE MADE IT!!
KabirC,"Once Dray hits 2 threes in a game, will have a lot more space "
KabirC,"LOL, there were like 3 fouls on Steph there"
KabirC,Steph was wide open for 3 that entire play
KabirC,"Rusty Simmons ‏@Rusty_SFChron  

Klay Thompson is back on the bench, with blood dripping out of his right ear. The stay was short. He's headed back to the locker room."
KabirC,"That's bullshit, he got pushed into Ariza"
KabirC,Kerr: Ball was loose
KabirC,Pelicans came in playing a lot better than the Mavs. And what do the Pelicans have to do with the Rockets playing the Mavs?
KabirC,Needed that 3 badly
KabirC,Andre just took a shot to the face
KabirC,"No problem haha, yeah he's public enemy #1 right now in the playoffs. "
KabirC,It was over after the missed rebounding foul on Dray and the Conley dagger
KabirC,Yes we are
KabirC,"Come on Klay, gotta get a shot off there"
KabirC,"Don't know about with the best of them, but he definitely can surprise with his hops"
KabirC,Warriors destroyed the Clippers who tried to trap Steph on every play. More often than not he makes the right play and the other team pays for playing 4 on 3.
KabirC,"Rose was guarding him primarily in that game. Steph was OFF, missed open shot after open shot. And didn't help that Klay was going on mini streaks."
KabirC,"LOL, what?"
KabirC,Klay is 3-9 so far in this game and 0-4 on threes. Didn't realize he took that many shots!
KabirC,"Ann Killion ‏@annkillion  

Good sign: Klay ""we don't want to go back to Houston"" Thompson just hit 14 out of 18 shots in warmups."
KabirC,"We're missing the best player in the NBA!! Based Speights.

But seriously, yeah somehow that's our only injury, he was our #4 scorer in the regular season though."
KabirC,"Lol, that certainly would be easier"
KabirC,Klay out of this game please
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Iguodala vs Pelicans

9-29 FGs, 2-16 3FGs

Iguodala vs Grizzlies

13-29 FGs, 7-15 3FGs"
KabirC,All you have to do is look at the Game 3 postgame thread for people clamoring the Warriors were a fraud and that the Grizz are going to destroy them.
KabirC,Refs are not going to call a foul on Livingston are they
KabirC,Please stop the Draymond 3s unless he's wide open 
KabirC,Can't afford to miss FTs for that when you have the lead.
KabirC,That's a foul every time
KabirC,"A few of the guys include John Wall, Andre Drummond, Rudy Gobert, Beno Udrih, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Bass, Raymond Felton, Carlos Boozer, Nik Stauskas, Eric Gordon and a bunch others. Because I work with them."
KabirC,Oklahoma State
KabirC,How the hell are the Rockets playing so badly? Step it up.
KabirC,"LOL, these freaking freaks of nature"
KabirC,"Warriors will run Curry off the ball a lot in that case, who's going to guard Klay?"
KabirC,I don't think I've ever seen someone have so much hate for a team
KabirC,If Beal had shoved him or something that'd make a lot more sense. 
KabirC,There's the stupid sequence of events we were expecting
KabirC,So salty ahahahaha
KabirC,"Warriors aren't playing well right now. 2 or 3 stupid turnovers, 5 missed open shots and the missed Barnes dunk. But definitely playing better than the Grizzlies."
KabirC,Andre's going to be on LeBron when he's in the game.
KabirC,"Tony Allen shoves Speights on the bench then walks in the middle of a performance, classy dude "
KabirC,Hawes just got a rebound over Dwight
KabirC,"Still down 7, Memphis can go on a quick 6-0 run. Until we tie/take the lead we aren't back."
KabirC,Barnes 4/4. Rest of the Warriors 11/34.
KabirC,"Draymond at center this game: 16 minutes, 47 Warriors points, +18"
KabirC,"Yup, been doing that for a long time, noticed it everywhere"
KabirC,"Steph, Klay and Durant are the only All-Stars unless you're projecting Draymond to somehow make an All-Star game."
KabirC,"He learned after his ankle problems. Not luck, was because of past experience. "
KabirC,Why is Teague getting so mad about that?
KabirC,Steph can't buy a shot right now
KabirC,"Steph, LeBron, Harden, Blake and either Rose or Butler"
KabirC,"Yup, would like to see that for sure."
KabirC,"Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83  

Harrison Barnes ruled no basket due to shot clock violation.
"
KabirC,"Is TA a good screener? Klay is pretty adept at getting around screens, so if he isn't, would not help the Grizz much."
KabirC,"This is kind of why I'm optimistic about a Cavs/Warriors finals should it happen, Adams is a defensive wizard and using Andre on LeBron while locking everyone else up and having Draymond and Bogut in the paint will make for a good series."
KabirC,Randolph slipped more than it was a foul
KabirC,"Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Mo Speights and Festus Ezeli off the bench."
KabirC,"Damn, Harden's back"
KabirC,He hasn't been cursed yet
KabirC,"Draymond never played PF under Mark Jackson, hell the Warriors starting line-up this year never played a minute together under Jackson."
KabirC,Extension of arms to the back while someone is jumping is an obvious foul.
KabirC,"LOL, you're drunk if you think there's a GS circle jerk going on right now. It's anti GS"
KabirC,"If we are going with this line-up, should have Ezeli instead of Lee. Much better defensively, and both provide little spacing."
KabirC,Good call.
KabirC,"He's prolly not going anywhere next year, Warriors won't give up assets to get rid of him."
KabirC,"Yeah that was the play where Johnson was lifting Curry's leg, he seemed to do that a lot when Steph tried to release."
KabirC,"Yeah, that makes sense."
KabirC,"Well first off, Warriors don't play a TON of small-ball. Kerr doesn't see it as effective for a long period of time. If Bogut needs to play more, he will. He didn't play much in the regular season so he wasn't injured in the playoffs. "
KabirC,"It also requires LeBron to be extremely efficient, which he hasn't been doing this playoffs."
KabirC,"Ok, that's an easy flagrant 2"
KabirC,That was off Dwight
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Curry is walking off. Stretcher not needed"
KabirC,That's what everyone says about Draymond...
KabirC,That's what's going to happen will be Barnes and Andre with a sprinkle of Klay and Dray on LeBron if we make the finals. Let LeBron get his and make it as hard for him as possible in the paint with Bogut and Draymond
KabirC,"It may kill the offense flow, but what makes the Warriors great is the elite defense, being able to set it every time would be quite nice. McHale would realize it's not worth it after a little while too."
KabirC,"Steph's pregnant wife, Ayesha."
KabirC,It's a foul
KabirC,Steph took 2 concussion tests. Why would the release any details? No medical team releases details to the public about injuries in the playoffs. 
KabirC,But that was also a much worse defense
KabirC,"Will be a lot more of Barnes and Andre while sprinkling in Klay, Livingston and Dray. Let LeBron do him and just make sure they don't get second chance opportunities and open 3s. Warriors have been good at doing that so far in the playoffs, just need to keep it up. 

Draymond is much more useful being in the paint with Bogut to clean up anything and keep TT and Mozgov off the boards."
KabirC,Just like the Spurs were gonna win the first series?
KabirC,"Missing the shots we need to hit

Edit: Klay happened"
KabirC,"Yup haha, interesting strategy, and Harden has to honor the inside cuts otherwise it is an easy 2"
KabirC,I do
KabirC,Iggy had to take that shot after getting Harden
KabirC,Livingston is getting no respect from the refs
KabirC,The sea just parted for Barnes
KabirC,"PG: Jason Terry

SG: Manu Ginobili HM: Chris Douglas-Roberts

SF: Andrei Kirilenko

PF: LeBron James

C: Chris Kaman"
KabirC,"No not at all, any of those 3 have the merits to be there. Although I do believe that Gasol is a slight step behind Duncan and Bogues this season"
KabirC,It's so loud you can't hear the whistle
KabirC,Steph tweaked his left ankle because of Terry undercutting his 3.
KabirC,"There was definitely contact to the head, got an arm straight to the head."
KabirC,Yeah you're jumping the gun. We're down 12 still
KabirC,That's terrible situational awareness 
KabirC,"Ahahahaha, yeah not much air space under the shoes on those shots"
KabirC,"He held the ball a lot longer than he needed to, had an open Bogut then Barnes"
KabirC,No it isn't.
KabirC,Crazy how much different this game would have been if they didn't screw up the 2 on 1 fast break and the Klay dunk
KabirC,Z-Bo just going to let Draymond take every 3? 
KabirC,He's not mentally there today
KabirC,"LOL, he wanted to make sure the foul was called, and it didn't affect Dwight at all."
KabirC,What are you talking about? Just about everyone on the Warriors is in foul trouble
KabirC,Well you guys are terrible 3 point shooters anyways
KabirC,"On the other hand, Warriors played pretty terribly outside of Steph and Bogut (minus all the turnovers). Klay didn't make any of his shots, Draymond was missing shots and throwing the ball away like Bogut, and Barnes wasn't making any of his shots either. "
KabirC,Grizz have slowed the pace of the game down a ton
KabirC,"LOL, that's not close to what it is. Google StubHub vs Warriors lawsuit."
KabirC,Gasol and VC are mad lol
KabirC,Tripped him
KabirC,He's shooting a ridiculous 69.2% from midrange in this series
KabirC,"Dwight gave the first push, Bogut pushed harder and then Dwight hits him in the head."
KabirC,"Fast Break @GSWFastBreak 

The only thing unprofessional in the Toyota Center was the Rockets' Game 3 performance. "
KabirC,Has Tony Allen come in the game since he came out?
KabirC,"Ok, this is just fucking ridiculous. Refs have fixed this game"
KabirC,It's kind of hard to stop the best offense in the NBA
KabirC,39 points on threes
KabirC,How was that not a foul? 
KabirC,His build
KabirC,Warriors with 16 assists on 20 made field goals
KabirC,"Not surprising at all, if it wasn't going to be a suspension he would have gotten a flagrant 2."
KabirC,"&gt; you're all seriously over-rating the Jumpshot squad

You're the one who said that and are talking about others spewing uniformed opinions as fact?
"
KabirC,"Steph doesn't drive as often as others, but when he does, he's one of the best finishers in the NBA. Shot 64.2% around the rim this year. Harden had around 200 more FG attempts around the rim than Steph this year and shot it at 54.7%. Harden had 422 FG attempts from the left side and ""only"" 186 from the right side. No stats for KD unfortunately, didn't play enough to have a good sample size."
KabirC,"That's not his average, that's just the Thunder reporter trying to be funny."
KabirC,"Ok, that's a good call, both guys were fouling."
KabirC,Until you get to Roaracle. 
KabirC,How the hell was that out on us?
KabirC,"I've got a ton of friends in pro sports, if they see something they like, they buy it or have their agent reach out to the company. Depends on the person. If it is a company trying to get advertising they will just send care packages out, mainly through agencies."
KabirC,That ball just floated up there in the air waiting for Dwight 
KabirC,They're all numbers
KabirC,"WOW, it is LOUD!!!"
KabirC,You seen Gasol or Randolph? All good bigs do it.
KabirC,"Warriors don't have any motivation, telegraphing all their passes, the don't want it at all."
KabirC,"They aren't showing any replays, you guys have had blatant fouls that they don't show either."
KabirC,"Joey Crawford is not going to call a foul for him, which is ridiculous since he's been fouled 3 or 4 times on drives"
KabirC,Joey Crawford T'd up Kerr because Crawford is terrible
KabirC,"Always missing our centers in past playoffs, and this year things have been much better so far."
KabirC,"Rosalyn Gold-Onwude ‏@ROSGO21  

Steph Curry will return to game. No signs concussion. Just contusion."
KabirC,"4th quarter they gave the advantage to the Warriors, that's for sure. Grizzlies get an advantage when Conley/TA hold on to Steph and Klay running off the ball so it goes both ways. "
KabirC,"Game tied 102-102, Warriors inbound the ball with 3.4 left. Steph Curry dribbles it up the court, and oh my god he pulled up at half with Tony Allen in his face, and bah god, he hit the three!!!"
KabirC,Why you shooting lightning? 
KabirC,Definitely
KabirC,"Klay hasn't been in this series, he was left in NOLA"
KabirC,Circlejerk going to circlejerk 
KabirC,"Lee, please never shoot."
KabirC,"Doesn't look like he meant to hit the face, but we don't know intent. "
KabirC,Very strange
KabirC,"That was a major travel, can't slide on the ground without dribbling"
KabirC,"No, they are a random person from around the country. "
KabirC,"He all of a sudden catches on fire and scores like 12 straight points, and then 10 minutes later he blows a fast break lay-up."
KabirC,"Warriors turned to crap when Bogut came out of the game after his ""3rd foul"""
KabirC,You might lose it as well
KabirC,Got a swipe to the face/eye
KabirC,They could have used that gif last night.
KabirC,I was hoping Andre would alley oop it to himself and go between the legs
KabirC,"Over Draymond? No chance, he's the 2nd most important guy to the Warriors success. Horford would probably be the first guy off the bench though. Not saying the Hawks are bad players at all, just a lot about the Warriors system and fit."
KabirC,Z-Bo just makes some stupidly ridiculous shots. Been doing it all series
KabirC,Lee and Livingston too. Everyone else who gets minutes does or has.
KabirC,Did they seriously call that? Brewer initiated all contact
KabirC,FESTUS!!!
KabirC,That's bullshit
KabirC,You seen Gasol's picks in this game? Both are setting illegal picks lol
KabirC,"Question is will they play Brewer or the Jet. Would make most sense for Harden to play ""PG"" basically what he's done all year round and try to hide him on Barnes while using Brewer and Ariza on Klay and Steph."
KabirC,"For people just reading the title, the average price for Game 5 is $292.30, hasn't slipped below $300 all playoffs long. This is based on the secondary reseller's market."
KabirC,Basically just going to be a free throw fest
KabirC,"That game was crazy, he just pulled up and hit ridiculous shots multiple times"
KabirC,So...
KabirC,Your username should be babywithadultteeth 
KabirC,"Oh I agree, but just saying the vomiting isn't just exclusive to a concussion.  He should have stayed in a dark room."
KabirC,Classy.
KabirC,He would have fouled out after the 2nd quarter
KabirC,"Welcome baby with adult teeth, going to delete this post like you do with all of your others?"
KabirC,Was that not over the cylinder? 
KabirC,Need to get the ball moving again
KabirC,"The 3rd game Dwight had played 18 straight games before coming into that game. I can't remember about the 2nd game, but yeah not at all for the 3rd game."
KabirC,"Yo Steph, don't do him like that"
KabirC,"LOL, that was hilarious"
KabirC,"Ah aight, that's smart then"
KabirC,"Yo, we aren't guarding Allen, not Lee."
KabirC,"What the fuck Randolph, you are just making ridiculous shots"
KabirC,"BBALLBREAKDOWN ‏@bballbreakdown  

Always weird when a referee calls a foul who isn’t even the picture"
KabirC,"If Teague isn't ejected, there will be some serious payback in the game, and there probably still will be. Refs better take care of the situation now."
KabirC,Steph too clutch!
KabirC,"I'd still put AD over him, but he's probably #2"
KabirC,In the playoffs.
KabirC,"Man, what an outlet pass by Steph"
KabirC,They ignored the shooting foul
KabirC,It's been that way since halftime. They want a game 7
KabirC,"Warriors have 7 turnovers so far in the 1st quarter, defense is good, but offense is BAD"
KabirC,"No, Steph has more time to go to get there. Steph needs a title and the continued success he's had so far."
KabirC,Not worth getting anyone in foul trouble. Warriors defense can hold them
KabirC,STEPH DUNK!!!
KabirC,"Refs are trying to keep the Rockets in this game, this is complete BS."
KabirC,2 easy floaters missed
KabirC,Andre had Steph wide open but tried a cross court pass
KabirC,What the hell is that call
KabirC,"He gets MVP treatment when he has the ball, off the ball is a completely different story."
KabirC,He tore apart the Warriors transition game singlehandedly. It's freaking insane
KabirC,Damn you are really salty
KabirC,"There is no reason for him to be here, an elbow to the face is the definition of a flagrant 2"
KabirC,What are you talking about Klay has been terrible offensively 
KabirC,We start to get close and then someone makes a stupid mistake
KabirC,Any specific shooters you like? 
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe 

Up-to-the-minute 3-point shooting this series:

Iguodala 41.7%

Curry 28.6%
"
KabirC,Where the hell is the foul there?
KabirC,"No, he starts at PF. In small ball he goes to C"
KabirC,No
KabirC,"Daniel Leroux ‏@DannyLeroux 

That is at least three open threes and a missed dunk for the #Warriors. Getting the looks early."
KabirC,"If you're rooting for TT, that's the way to go. Draymond handles the ball a lot more, takes more threes and is averaging a double double and has been close to a triple double multiple times."
KabirC,How is that a foul? He's just standing there
KabirC,Scott Foster is an official no one wants to see.
KabirC,One of the fans got in his ear trying to distract him from shooting a three and he's been killing them since then
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

I've honestly just been watching Tony Allen pace around like a madman during Curry's trophy handoff

"
KabirC,"Draymond didn't guard him, Andre did. And LeBron was insane in that game"
KabirC,He got all hand
KabirC,"No they won't, Bogut is going to be on Z-Bo and Draymond will be on Gasol. It's how the Warriors neutralized both guys in the last 2 match-ups."
KabirC,It's Draymond on Gasol...
KabirC,"Wow, the Hawks had all the chances in the world. Tie game with 17 seconds to go, iso 3 pointer by Teague with LeBron bearing down on him. Mike Scott with a chance to secure the rebound and just watched it go to the Cavs. Wide open 3 pointer to tie the game in OT. All missed."
KabirC,"Yup it is, which is why he doesn't look at the refs for a call afterwards."
KabirC,"That was sick by Harden, and then he gets worked by Austin Rivers"
KabirC,Bogut destroyed him in the game
KabirC,Terrible defense
KabirC,"He's not a bitch, but he'll definitely take on match ups that are favorable to him and to his rules"
KabirC,He blessed the Hawks...
KabirC,Too much basketball left.
KabirC,"Great, another game where we are missing all our shots"
KabirC,"Yup, he can't hit them close to his rate in the season right now."
KabirC,A Draymond 3 is not the shot we want when we need points
KabirC,Golden State Warriors
KabirC,"The latter, look at the Warriors with Andre Iguodala."
KabirC,God damn it Josh Smith
KabirC,"They are calling some random things, not calling others. It's just terrible reffing, don't think they know what they are calling for either team"
KabirC,There has been no one closing out on those open shots. 
KabirC,Bogut won the tip!
KabirC,"Unless he got smacked there, yeah he's going on there"
KabirC,/r/mathfail 
KabirC,Klay is garbage in this game
KabirC,"Yup, that one where he head butted Bogut and got the foul call was probably the strangest "
KabirC,Andre missed a wide open Klay in the corner for 3
KabirC,"He played good defense in the regular season, playoffs he has been bad."
KabirC,"Holy shit, he missed a step back."
KabirC,"Uhh, yeah. 

Curry

MJ

Draymond

Ayres

Bogut"
KabirC,"Nah man, it's hilarious."
KabirC,Gasol has had at least 3 or 4 travels in this game running the fastbreak lol
KabirC,Draymond isn't offering any spacing anyways. 
KabirC,Tallest SG in the league!!
KabirC,"Steph, why are you trying to dunk it? Almost lost the 2 points"
KabirC,Same kind of foul that Steph got once and then didn't get next time last game
KabirC,"Losing team complains the most, always happens."
KabirC,Steph almost had his 5th steal
KabirC,"LOL, dude is just hugging Curry right in front of the refs, no call."
KabirC,"I guess I read that wrong, when he said may see more of that, thought he was referring to putting Mozgov in rather than TT at the 5 which is why I was confused. "
KabirC,Z-Bo is making all his jumpers
KabirC,DJ
KabirC,We're here
KabirC,"Warriors definitely say no, Draymond is perfect in our system. Cavs say no as well."
KabirC,Oh my god Steph!!
KabirC,"Bogut looked like he got hurt when he went down earlier, hopefully he's good"
KabirC,Over the back on Koufos 
KabirC,Ariza is holding on for dear life not to end up on a vine
KabirC,Hawks are just throwing Wizards players down for rebounds
KabirC,"Blake is on Harden, take advantage of that"
KabirC,Classy Dwight.
KabirC,Jones went through Ezeli's back to get the ball too
KabirC,Both LeBron and Harden drive and dish and Draymond is the outlet guy for any traps and swing passes.
KabirC,"Warriors moving the ball well and not turning it over while playing suffocating defense, this is the Warriors brand of basketball."
KabirC,No it doesn't.
KabirC,Andre is the one that's guarding him the most
KabirC,"That's a shot he makes more often than not. I'm fine with Steph taking that shot, but yeah he wasn't making his shots tonight, nor was Klay."
KabirC,"Holy shit, Barnes is broken"
KabirC,"I've got a paper due tomorrow, I've written the intro so far. This game has me hooked"
KabirC,"He's getting hit a lot on the arm and he's trying to draw a foul call, but he's not going to after getting the tech"
KabirC,Klay. Bad shots and bad defense
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Bay Area media has been called homers for much of these playoffs. Nation, THAT is what we’ve been watching all year"
KabirC,What the hell Bogut...
KabirC,Time to get helmets out around Ariza
KabirC,At least 6 or 7
KabirC,Not at all lol
KabirC,"Conley is playing, but apparently his mask is fogging up. That's going to be a bitch to deal with while chasing Steph/Klay along with his impaired vision"
KabirC,"Bogut does it too, so as long as they don't call it both ways it is fine"
KabirC,Z-Bo had no interest in going around the screen
KabirC,Happens all the time
KabirC,Draymond is getting fucked ton these foul calls
KabirC,"This is bullshit, call the fouls on Conley and Allen grabbing runners."
KabirC,"You remember game 3, don't you?"
KabirC,Why isn't DJ in the game now? That makes no sense at all
KabirC,"Draymond, Barnes, Andre, and Livingston all can. Then add the star power of Steph and Klay"
KabirC,"Dray can take Davis as he showed in the playoffs, but can Kawhi do the same on Duncan?"
KabirC,Andris Biedrins
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe 

Grizzlies had caution tape keeping players from walking out while the kids were performing"
KabirC,"Yeah, that's why I'm confused. Guy goes to ASU then says Steve Kerr is better than Steve Nash"
KabirC,"Now, go for the kill. Can finish the game with Andre if we need to."
KabirC,"Fran Blinebury ‏@franblinebury  

Draymond Green as Warriors enter locker room at half: ""Keep fightin' back, fellas. I promise you they'll (effin) crack."""
KabirC,And counting
KabirC,It's ridiculous how little respect he gets off the ball
KabirC,Oh how the tide has changed...
KabirC,Ok Bogut
KabirC,Steph's like 50% on threes right now
KabirC,"Yeah, Bogut and Draymond can bang with the best of them and are the best defensive duo in the NBA in my opinion. "
KabirC,"Probably not, Warriors need elite defense from their C more than offense. Korver might start over Barnes for some games just to make it impossible for teams to defend the Warriors."
KabirC,"How many steals is that of guys just holding the ball, the Wizards need to learn how to protect a basketball"
KabirC,"His shot is gone because of injuries, his touch I'm not too sure that's because of injuries though. "
KabirC,Oh shit
KabirC,"Nah, that's definitely Steph. Offense has absolutely no flow at all without him. No person who can carry the load. Draymond is definitely #2 with Klay and Bogut behind."
KabirC,"LOL, and the dumbest post of the hour goes to..."
KabirC,Z-Bo and Gasol do it all the time
KabirC,"It was, he went up and just got pushed out of the picture"
KabirC,What the hell was that Klay
KabirC,"Yes, 2nd in regulation, 1st time we've lost all season allowing fewer than 100"
KabirC,He said 85 Bear
KabirC,Better defense and rebounding.
KabirC,"I know he's eligible, but there's no chance he will sign an extension before because the Warriors have decisions to make."
KabirC,Conley comes down and hits a 3. 5 point swing right there
KabirC,"GSWStats

Stephen Curry has matched a playoff-career-high with four steals, tying Tim Hardaway for 6th on the club's all-time playoff steals list (41)"
KabirC,"Yeah, and then piss off Bogut again"
KabirC,Kerr's sending a message to the Warriors.
KabirC,"Offensively, will Z-Bo be able to hit all his shots outside the paint like he did in game 1. If not, will be a lot tougher for the Grizz to get any offense going"
KabirC,"Steph is #4 in the league, AD is just phenomenal. "
KabirC,Bogut is going to be on Mozgov and Draymond will be on TT
KabirC,"Yeah, they did it in the regular season since Gasol operates more from the high post and Randolph in the low post. Killed Gasol and Randolph both time when Bogut was there."
KabirC,Shhhhhhh
KabirC,"Watch the replay, he definitely got hit"
KabirC,Given out
KabirC,"When he gets hot, there's very little stopping him. Klay on fire is more scary than Steph on fire"
KabirC,LeBron James
KabirC,Bogut just got thrown down.
KabirC,Still down 8
KabirC,"Joey Crawford was complete garbage tonight, random techs to Jones, Livingston and Kerr and somehow all the refs kept Dwight in the game."
KabirC,They also had DMo and Bev for those games
KabirC,Maybe you can ask D-Rose?
KabirC,Not really...
KabirC,That's kind of what I'm worried about
KabirC,"Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence and thrice is a pattern."
KabirC,"Similar styles. Both look to drive to the basket and kick out to the open man when defenses collapse on them. Warriors are fine with the opposing player driving and playing 1 on 1 with Bogut there to help. If they play defensively like they did in the Rockets series, minus game 4, will be able to handle it very well."
KabirC,That left arm is messed up
KabirC,"Complete shit to start last game, complete shit again"
KabirC,Joey Crawford is about to T up someone here
KabirC,Warriors are just blowing every chance. 2 on 1 leads to a turnover and then Klay misses a dunk and Grizz get the 3.
KabirC,Or calling a foul on a push off
KabirC,"He smacked him straight in the head, that's not a play on the ball."
KabirC,"Dwight has 6 so far, 1 more and it is an automatic suspension. "
KabirC,"Not condoning it, but you seen our sub after you guys won game 3?"
KabirC,"You haven't been watching this game, have you?"
KabirC,Lol Klay
KabirC,"Klay, stop fouling Dwight. You are an idiot"
KabirC,"Oops, meant 2018 at the end."
KabirC,"Come on Bogut, Barnes had an easy dunk. Bogut has been terrible passing it tonight"
KabirC,Refs weren't happy with Livingston or Draymond in this game at all
KabirC,You not watch the first round?
KabirC,What the hell is Harden doing on some of these passes
KabirC,He's not coming back tonight
KabirC,That wasn't a blocking foul
KabirC,He did
KabirC,"Harden was grabbing Andre's arm and then flopped, and people wonder why his style isn't liked."
KabirC,He hasn't this year. He's only played the 4 and 5. Last year he played the 3 until the playoffs.
KabirC,"We got GOAT Walton too, but neither count for the roster"
KabirC,20*
KabirC,"No he didn't, go look at the stats when he was guarded by Draymond. 

Here's just a quick look at through game 2, got even better in game 3.

https://twitter.com/TheNBABulletin/status/590988832763469824"
KabirC,Spurs fans complaining all thread long
KabirC,"DeAndre Jordan vs Dwight Howard, Josh Smith and Clint Capela"
KabirC,Steph only had 2 points after that 1st quarter
KabirC,"Yeah, we want you guys to reverse sweep the Cavs too."
KabirC,LOL
KabirC,Warriors getting sloppy
KabirC,He went to Davidson
KabirC,Question answered 
KabirC,"Hahahahaha, all good"
KabirC,"Thought there wasn't a foul there at first, but Duncan got him with the body on the 2nd replay. Could go either way"
KabirC,We've done this thread many times.
KabirC,"Yes, I've heard. He hates both teams."
KabirC,"Lol, Conley with the obvious foul on Steph"
KabirC,They're going to call it any time someone hits the ground with contact on a loose ball 
KabirC,"He sounds more like a high schooler 5 years ago, it really wasn't until recently that people stopped or at least see it as socially unacceptable to use ""gay"" as an insult."
KabirC,Teague was watching the Warriors/Rockets game yesterday and now thinks he's Steph Curry
KabirC,Foul on Ariza there too hitting the elbow
KabirC,Harden grabs and locks arms while driving more than any other player in the league
KabirC,Andre gambled for the steal there
KabirC,How is that on Draymond? 
KabirC,"Glad Joey hit the deck, terrible ref"
KabirC,"Klay's got his shot back, have fun Houston."
KabirC,An elbow to the face is a flagrant 2
KabirC,"Klay's garbage again, need to stop going to him."
KabirC,"When Klay's cold he still normally hits his mid-range shots, and is like 50% or so on open corner threes."
KabirC,"He wins a lot of tips, just happened he was going up against Dwight last round and then Marc Gasol the round before, he still won a few against both and won just about all against the Pelicans. Also, tips are based a lot on timing rather than pure jumping ability.

KabirC,Yes they can.

26 possessions. 45-22 HOU.  173 Ortg for HOU, 85 for GSW. HOU TS% 94.7.  More advanced stats: "
KabirC,Need lots more 1-4 pick and roll.
KabirC,Steph has to keep his head up on those
KabirC,Dray had his hands raised before Steph released 
KabirC,"Barnes made the right cut, Bogut normally drops it behind the back for the easy slam"
KabirC,"Come on, just lay that in HB"
KabirC,I own a clothing line and a sports art company
KabirC,Andre just needed to put on the breaks and had an easy lay-up
KabirC,Can't blame em
KabirC,You guys are down 14 with all the refs help
KabirC,There's the make-up call 
KabirC,STEPH CURRY!!!
KabirC,"Yeah it's one of those 3, I went homer pick with Bogut. I do think he's the best defensive center in the league, only thing is he's missed a good amount of time and didn't play all that many minutes"
KabirC,Did they just call a foul? Fuck these refs
KabirC,"Klay has been an idiot all game long, but Harden's been flopping everywhere."
KabirC,Are you already drunk? 
KabirC,"Yeah, that's not going to happen. "
KabirC,LOL Clippers
KabirC,No he didn't.
KabirC,"Unpopular? Nah, that's very popular around."
KabirC,"You realize the nickname started from Drake's song 0-100, right? Then later people started calling James, Chef Harden."
KabirC,"Warriors shooting 29% on 3s and 37% overall, only took 38 shots in the first half and had 10 turnovers. WOW."
KabirC,Steph needs to learn the foul drawing art from Harden
KabirC,Because of his arm injury
KabirC,"Oh my god, how do you miss 3 chances"
KabirC,"Yes, but you can't have Draymond."
KabirC,"That's why that foul is in the game, refs missed the call and Beal got injured too"
KabirC,"Glad Klay is out of the game, he has given up 9 easy points and missed all his open shots."
KabirC,Slow it down a bit guys
KabirC,"Today was the cheapest game with the lowest price at $176 (besides the pregame ticket drop, if it happened) and average price at $292."
KabirC,He's a HUGE liability out there for them. They need to score for a chance to win.
KabirC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tdbig/tifu_by_enraging_the_parents_of_my_girlfriend_by/

Sounds like this"
KabirC,They also had DMo and Bevereley in those games.
KabirC,"It's nice to have Klay guard a player like Conley, not that Steph is bad, but it's just another defensive match-up."
KabirC,Like I said.
KabirC,Livingston should have lobbed that up to Ezeli
KabirC,It's ridiculous how well Harden is shooting the mid-range this series.
KabirC,"Jimmy Spencer ‏@JimmySpencerNBA  

James Harden only has eight shots, but he’s got to the line 11 times already. He starts the 4th quarter on the bench. Something seems off."
KabirC,"Yeah he did, you see the replay bruh?"
KabirC,"That's the game, god damn it. "
KabirC,Yes
KabirC,"If Draymond makes 2 threes in the first quarter, we have a good chance."
KabirC,"Ok, these refs are just ridiculous now."
KabirC,DJ is on the bench because of Hack-a-DJ
KabirC,"His man defense is ok, but his help defense is terrible."
KabirC,"Are you kidding me, that's not a charge."
KabirC,"WAS, he has lost all of his game since then and he doesn't fit in the Warriors scheme"
KabirC,Foul on Harden? He just pushed Andre down
KabirC,"Out of everyone, Bogut somehow gets the foul there?"
KabirC,"Gasol had 21 points on 6-17 shooting. Gasol isn't destroying anyone, Z-Bo is.

http://espn.go.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3206/marc-gasol"
KabirC,Anyone else find Blake's jumper hilarious? That jump is just so strange
KabirC,Trying to promote him in anything non boxing is just a bad idea.
KabirC,Thank god
KabirC,"I thought that, but need a replay."
KabirC,Dwight just elbowed Andre on that screen
KabirC,They've been shady since half time
KabirC,While Conley stays in the game somehow
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

The most brutal GSW turnover was that pass to Capela when Curry was wide open behind the arc"
KabirC,Stephback 
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Forgot to tweet this: saw Jameis Winston in the Toyota Center"
KabirC,"Don't agree with that call, DJ went into him "
KabirC,"They can't buy a foul. Grizz, on the other hand, have bought many."
KabirC,"Yeah, I hated that shot. He had no reason to take that at all"
KabirC,"Refs aren't giving the Wizards any love, helping out the Hawks a ton"
KabirC,Andre didn't want to pass to Barbosa for the open 3 even though Steph was telling him to
KabirC,"It was the same way all series long, Warriors are just making more of those shots now."
KabirC,That was like a 2K alley-oop where you throw it but the defender pushes the receiving player out of the way.
KabirC,"Warriors played their defense, didn't turn the ball over and Steph killed the Rockets in the 2nd."
KabirC,"I can't, the dude does so much for the community"
KabirC,8
KabirC,"He's headed to the series, means he'll be there for both games. Likely announced game 2."
KabirC,"Not a clue, that's what the projections were sent out by the NBA: https://twitter.com/DraftExpress/status/589170649727422464"
KabirC,Harden with the flop
KabirC,That's the series with CP3 out
KabirC,Anyone have a replay of that foul? Didn't look like a foul at all
KabirC,Harden's been dropping it off a ton
KabirC,"Draymond has to play well offensively, can't be making stupid mistakes and missing open shots"
KabirC,"Jimmy Spencer ‏@JimmySpencerNBA  

Kind of puts in perspective how Klay Thompson scored 37 points in one quarter by himself."
KabirC,"Grizz have a decision to make, sacrifice TA's defense for offense or hope TA can make shots."
KabirC,Curry is 2 of his last 15 from 3
KabirC,Steph is ice cold
KabirC,What adjustments can you make besides pulling TA? Try to have Allen drive into Bogut? Hope Allen makes his shots?
KabirC,"Fast Break @GSWFastBreak

Warriors handing out ""Strength in Numbers"" shirts again to Dub Nation in attendance. Rockets fans asking for them too."
KabirC,"Beverley is also a huge liability on offense. Have to consider the past, Rockets wouldn't have made it to the WCF without Josh Smith hitting 3s, DMo can't do that."
KabirC,"Had so much time to pick up everyone and still left 2 guys open, that's embarrassing defense by the Clippers"
KabirC,"That was a late foul call, the right call though."
KabirC,Traveled before the foul
KabirC,"If Rockets fans want to know why /r/nba hates the Rockets, this game is the perfect example. Harden started the game trying to draw fouls, once the game is out of reach Dwight goes for the cheap shot and then Terry acts tough on Draymond.
"
KabirC,"Barnes and Andre. They'll give different looks at LeBron with Draymond, Livingston and Klay. But those will be the two main guys. "
KabirC,His shot is off
KabirC,"His arm and hand is probably broken too, hoping the best for Steph."
KabirC,Will they ever call the other team for holding Steph off the ball? No. There are things in basketball that aren't called ever.
KabirC,"Depends on the team we are playing, but it's a 2a and 2b situation with Klay and him"
KabirC,"But Lil B hasn't cursed him yet, just warned him.

Here the proof for you: https://twitter.com/LILBTHEBASEDGOD/status/601803363513077761"
KabirC,3 second violation anyone?
KabirC,"1. Anthony Davis

2. Steph Curry

3. James Harden

4. LeBron James

5. Chris Paul

6. Russell Westbrook

7. LaMarcus Alrdridge

8. Blake Griffin

9. Marc Gasol

10. Kawhi Leonard

11. Klay Thompson

12. Tim Duncan"
KabirC,Thank god for Barbosa in this game
KabirC,"1. Steph

2. Harden

3. Dwight

4. Klay

5. Draymond 

6. Andrew Bogut

7. Harrison Barnes

8. Josh Smith

9. Trevor Ariza

10. Jason Terry

Would those be the approximate rankings of the starting players in this round for you too?"
KabirC,What kind of defense was that by Redick? The spin in a circle?
KabirC,"Stephen Curry has 6 threes, 6 steals and 6 rebounds."
KabirC,Klay and Barnes are a combined 4/19 in this game
KabirC,"Why are you so angry at Steph? LOL, you're embarrassing yourself."
KabirC,Conley is getting away with much more than people normally do when hugging Steph
KabirC,"Great job Teague, you finally made one!"
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe 

Warriors are 6-24 from 3. They’ve made 6 or fewer 3s six times this season. They went 5-1"
KabirC,"Yeah, it's terrible. Like that one 9 step fastbreak lay-up. But at least they don't often lead to a 4th foul on the opposing team's center."
KabirC,Yeah...91% in the playoffs!!!
KabirC,That's complete BS. These refs aren't getting out of Oracle alive.
KabirC,"He wasn't anywhere close to the ball though, the result was an him getting nowhere near the ball."
KabirC,Steph will let Klay take over if Allen is working him.
KabirC,"Great defense guys, just leave him open for 3"
KabirC,"How is it unpopular? It's pretty obvious, he's the best player in the series based on what he has done this playoffs."
KabirC,He's not an FA this summer. He's signed for 3.873 million next year.
KabirC,"No, only a concussion"
KabirC,"KEVIN DING ‏@KevinDing  - Bleacher Report Senior Writer

Stephen Curry's mom is high-fiving the rest of the family here in the stands. Lead cut to 10 by halftime--and Steph might be coming back."
KabirC,"Time to get Steph out of the game, they're starting to take some shots at him off screens."
KabirC,11 Warriors turnovers for 16 points for the Rockets
KabirC,You're the one who's been whining all game thread long
KabirC,Ahahahahahahaha
KabirC,Draymond's eaten Blake in all their match-ups. He's one of the few guys who guards Blake really well
KabirC,Not that easy to back down and work Draymond
KabirC,6-18
KabirC,Steph Curry had 33 points on 11-22 shooting with 4-9 on 3s and 7-9 on FTs. Added in 8 rebounds and 5 assists and 2 steals.
KabirC,"Yeah Shump will be on Klay. So the help would probably come from LeBron, but Barnes can knock down open shots. So it's definitely a tough situation. If Klay is out, then the Cavs match-up much better."
KabirC,"Yeah he'd go at it for a time when Steph gets insanely hot, but the problem there is Steph does a ton of his work in transition. If LeBron wants to be THE guy covering, some of his teammates might back off when they see LeBron running back and then that's just enough time for Steph to nail a 3. Will be an interesting dynamic for sure.

Will be interested to see if Barnes tries to drive against LeBron to get him foul trouble. But yeah Andre and Barnes have both been amazing in the playoffs, especially with Andre's facilitating. Andre is leading the league in AST/TO ratio at 10.75, so if he hits a one or two 3s in the first half, LeBron is going to have to commit a lot more to Andre. "
KabirC,"Klay started last game terrible, does it again. "
KabirC,There he goes
KabirC,"Still too many stupid mistakes and missing open shots in this game, have to clean that up"
KabirC,"They tweeted about him and welcomed him there, Bay Area market hates him. And associating with him outside of the ring for anything is a bad idea"
KabirC,"They're at 44% for the game, but only 25% (2-8) on 3s."
KabirC,Dwight lane violation there
KabirC,That's ironic.
KabirC,12
KabirC,Why is Barbosa in this game?
KabirC,"Refs never call moving screens, Dray does it, Z-Bo does it and Gasol does it."
KabirC,"The Warriors already have two Splash Brothers, but is there room for three? According to Mychal Thompson of ESPN LA 710, the Warriors will reportedly pursue Durant hard in free agency in 2016 (9:55):


“I also heard it on good authority from a team that plays in the Bay Area that they’re going to go hard after Kevin Durant.”"
KabirC,No one has called that classless
KabirC,"It has something, but they're bricking a ton of open shots"
KabirC,"Another stupid turnover, when will this team step it up in this game"
KabirC,"Klay's technically a ""star"" player, but he's a complementary star. "
KabirC,"LetsGoWarriors ‏@LetsGoWarriors  

Bob Myers: ""It looks like things should be okay"""
KabirC,"He may have shown up:

Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83  

Is that Floyd Mayweather?"
KabirC,"You guys have, best your offense has looked in a while. Shooting 52% and Z-Bo and Gasol knocking down their jumpers"
KabirC,"That's what it looked like, Andre got the ball"
KabirC,How'd CP3 do in the the last round?
KabirC,Barbosa had Steph wide open
KabirC,"Beno on Klay? That might be the recipe for supernova Klay, I wouldn't mind that. Yeah will be a game full of match-ups"
KabirC,Salt.
KabirC,"LOL, I can't remember now"
KabirC,Playing 4 on 3 with Draymond as the primary ball handler will get the Grizzlies killed 
KabirC,"That's a bad call, he had no control and was just barreling into the paint."
KabirC,Get Klay out of the game
KabirC,"Crowd got hyped for the dunk, Bogut said get out of here."
KabirC,"Quite the opposite of our other playoff runs, pretty surprising haha"
KabirC,Steph gets caught in no man's land too often
KabirC,"If Rockets fans want to know why /r/nba hates the Rockets, this game is the perfect example. Harden started the game trying to draw fouls, once the game is out of reach Dwight goes for the cheap shot and then Terry acts tough on Draymond."
KabirC,Warriors are missing all their shots right now
KabirC,Probably got RTed into his timeline.
KabirC,Steph missing open 3s and only has made 3s tonight
KabirC,Lil B has pissed off all of Houston
KabirC,And very little money.
KabirC,"Fast Break ‏@GSWFastBreak  

Rockets broke their huddle early. Have been standing at the scorers table looking into space and not talking to each other for 30 seconds."
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Josh Smith makes the open 3, Curry doesn’t … whodathunkit"
KabirC,Well he's saving you guys so far
KabirC,Draymond is out of the game because the refs messed up a call and called a slip a foul lol
KabirC,"LOL, how did Gortat mess that up"
KabirC,DAVID LEE BLOCK!
KabirC,Dunleavy goes under a guy in the air...
KabirC,Take Steph out of the game
KabirC,Why would Bogut get a tech for clapping? LOL
KabirC,"They didn't show the tech, they just showed how it started. They got techs on the other half of the court"
KabirC,"It's the Anthony Davis effect, he's that damn good at affecting the game.

Plus the fact they could knock down 3s really well"
KabirC,It was Speights
KabirC,"That's a terrible foul call, Rockets you got your make-up"
KabirC,"Steph is releasing way too fast, that theory of him releasing fast when he misses is true."
KabirC,He's killing the game other than the turnovers
KabirC,"LOL, that wasn't an offensive foul. Lee was moving into him, guess that makes up for the BS Draymond call"
KabirC,Because Perkins is going to be playing so much
KabirC,"He's grabbing him at every cut, if they don't call that, Ariza won't give up many more"
KabirC,"Come on HB, how do you lose Ariza"
KabirC,Klay made it! Get that confidence going
KabirC,"Zach Harper @talkhoops 

Early returns for player tracking from tonight for Warriors:

Game 1 - 20/38 contested, 19/39 uncontested

Game 2 - 26/51 cfg, 5/23 ucfg"
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

The red on the floor is mostly blood"
KabirC,Get Klay out of this game. He needs to be on a short leash again
KabirC,"What is it about Teague's shooting motion that makes it look like he doesn't care about the shot lol, looks lackadaisical. Don't know if that's just me though"
KabirC,"Hey, they called that foul!"
KabirC,Dwight is the biggest bitch in the NBA.
KabirC,"JR Smith, Shumpert and TT are better than Draymond, Andre, Barnes, Livingston and the rest of our role players? Come on now.

Edit: This was his response: why is that hard to believe i can see the argument for draymond but theres no way those other guys are better than shump not even gonna mention jr"
KabirC,"This one and the call before, hell the one before was a foul on Jones."
KabirC,"I don't want a freaking video, I don't want him tossing any salads."
KabirC,"Dray has 7-6-4, guessing they will try to double Steph more in the 2nd half meaning that Dray will have a good chance at the triple double"
KabirC,"You probably hate Oracle too. Fans get excited when someone takes a shot, how dare they!!"
KabirC,"That wasn't, that's what started it. They picked them up later on down the floor"
KabirC,Let's see what the bench can do
KabirC,"Yup, that's exactly it. Andre and Barnes would be gone. And Ezeli's contract will be a big thing. Bench would be Livingston-Holiday-free agent-McAdoo-Ezeli"
KabirC,Draymond has 5-5-3 so far
KabirC,Has had like 4 open 3s that he's missed. And a few blown lay-ups
KabirC,Man Barnes has improved his rebounding so much 
KabirC,"LOL, this was in context. 2 straight stupid turnovers playing too fast"
KabirC,Can we ban Scott Foster from the NBA?
KabirC,Jones never had the ball
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

Bogut's still wincing and rubbing his face"
KabirC,"For some teams that can't get it going, yes."
KabirC,Well he's been left open for all of them
KabirC,Steph just got a rebound against Dwight
KabirC,Only 4 fouls for the Grizz.
KabirC,Great defense Steph
KabirC,Gasol and Z-Bo vs Lee and Bogut? They'd be scoring at will against Lee. Draymond would have been a SF under Jackson.
KabirC,Klay and Draymond are complete shit right now
KabirC,"That's not close to being true, he guarded all the PGs this year. Last year he didn't."
KabirC,Good call
KabirC,They were screwing us before that.
KabirC,They said that's what started it. The techs weren't given out until the got across half.
KabirC,"Is it getting too loud for you, Monty?"
KabirC,"Oh man, Beal got kicked in the face"
KabirC,"That's how they try to stop Steph, it's working"
KabirC,Bogut says get that weak stuff out of here!
KabirC,STEPH!!
KabirC,Did Calathes just scratch Steph?
KabirC,"Oh definitely, TA KILLED Klay. But there were a TON of stupid mistakes and missed shots on our end. Steph had way too many shots he should have made. "
KabirC,He already gave his speech
KabirC,"Quadruple-double watch: Stephen Curry has 18 points, six rebounds, six steals and five assists."
KabirC,"LOL, wtf Barbosa"
KabirC,Steph poses a completely different threat than CP3. You give him an inch and he'll drop the 3 on you. 
KabirC,He's a tall guy
KabirC,Ok yup thought I heard MVP chants
KabirC,In the playoffs? Not as good as the regular season 
KabirC,"Someone told me Andrew Bogut is one of the worst rim protectors in the NBA, I laughed thinking it was a joke, he was serious."
KabirC,Curry has been taken to the Rockets' weight room to have X-rays. He just walked out on his own power.
KabirC,Anti-Dray circlejerk is back
KabirC,HOLY SHIT ANDRE!!!!
KabirC,Warriors have 6 turnovers and the Grizz have 7 so far in this game.
KabirC,"FT% won't matter much, will be how Bogut gets into Dwight's head."
KabirC,He hasn't cursed Harden yet
KabirC,Livingston and Klay have been terrible in this game
KabirC,Why is the crowd going crazy? I don't care for these interviews
KabirC,That's just great...
KabirC,"They don't call it, they never will"
KabirC,That's an obvious foul too.
KabirC,Why didn't Steph step to the side?
KabirC,"The runner-up DPOY was a SF under Mark Jackson, Kerr was willing to try him at PF after Lee got injured and it worked out. The Warriors starting line-up this year didn't play a single minute under Jackson. 

Kerr uses his assistants very well and Kerr definitely gets too much credit, but everyone acknowledges how good Adams and Gentry are."
KabirC,Well these fouls are even...11 to 4
KabirC,Steph with the terrible turnover
KabirC,Ahahahahahaha
KabirC,"Oh I know, I've been seeing his stuff in the game thread, the dude is pissed "
KabirC,"Hey, Steph made it!"
KabirC,"Shit, /u/skittlesfantastic is from an alternative universe guys! "
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss 

Haven't seen security come out during breaks. The, ""Ref u suck!"" chant brings out the black suits"
KabirC,"Draymond ""I'M TALKING TO YOU"""
KabirC,Draymond never played as a PF under Jackson either
KabirC,"Rosalyn Gold-Onwude ‏@ROSGO21  

Steph Curry has left lockerroom. He's standing outside with head athletic trainer."
KabirC,Kerr saw he started to get confident and pulled him.
KabirC,I think he was talking about the shots
KabirC,"Yeah, which is why he'll probably guard Steph. Wouldn't make sense for the Cavs."
KabirC,Scott Foster
KabirC,"May 25th is bad for Bay Area sports with Posey, Pagan and now Curry."
KabirC,Normally refs help the team losing
KabirC,Going to take AD and/or KD being injured and then outplaying Steph/Harden/LeBron/CP3.
KabirC,"We wouldn't have Draymond playing the PF under Jackson, he never tried the Warriors starting line-up this year for one minute last year."
KabirC,"Draymond has killed Gasol all series long, Z-Bo has killed us inside."
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe 

Floyd Mayweather bought four courtside seats next to scorer’s table — $9,000 a pop — he hasn’t showed up yet"
KabirC,Harden got caught watching the ball twice and left Klay open
KabirC,Steph had the easy lay-up if he went for it.
KabirC,"Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83 

Andrew Bogut had a brief conversation with the trainer, but appears OK and is stretching."
KabirC,Warriors have been 2 Klay 3s from Roaracle exploding
KabirC,"When he was taking that shot, you just had to know he was gonna nail it"
KabirC,Jason Terry fouled the shit out of Dray
KabirC,Moose just threw down Mozgov on that rebound attempt
KabirC,"Steph, stop fucking leaving Conley."
KabirC,8 second violation!
KabirC,"Z-Bo is just making everything, not much Dray can do there"
KabirC,"Klay hit the 3 after the whistle, got his momentum going"
KabirC,"Ezeli didn't bite on the fake, good"
KabirC,"Yeah, another 7 footer could never push him down or get him off balance..."
KabirC,Brewer just slapping Livingston
KabirC,"They're planning good defense now, but earlier they were just leaving all of our guys open"
KabirC,"Well yes, someone is going to be exiting today"
KabirC,"That's BS, Livingston got fouled on the other end."
KabirC,He got it JUST before it hit the backboard
KabirC,Harden's flopping everywhere
KabirC,"It would depend on what Lee you have, if he's not shit, then yes. But as it stands, no."
KabirC,Bogut got the strip too
KabirC,"Did you seriously put Westbrook at #3 in the league?

1. LeBron

2. KD

3. Anthony Davis"
KabirC,Barnes just lost Smith
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

It’s time for Kerr to put Iguodala/Barnes on Harden. Not only is he scoring on Thompson but Thompson’s offense has disappeared"
KabirC,They already did hahaha
KabirC,"I think the ""shameless flop"" one was better."
KabirC,"Steph only played 36 minutes in this game and had 40 points on 19 shots with 5 rebounds and 7 assists.
"
KabirC,"He definitely should have gone through it, don't know what they are thinking"
KabirC,"Steph gets fouled on his shot, then draws a charge, neither called."
KabirC,"Always happens, refs will never call it, he just plays through it"
KabirC,"Ariza has 36 minutes, Dwight has 37 and Harden has 38"
KabirC,"Yup, good start on those"
KabirC,Warriors are playing terribly as well though. Everyone in foul trouble and shooting 31% from three. Steph is only 3-10.
KabirC,"In celebrations? It happens all the time in most sports. Baseball is a huge example of it, as is hockey."
KabirC,"Around there, for an actual seat (not standing room) is $176."
KabirC,Randolph is hitting all his shots
KabirC,Udrih with the 7 step drive into the paint
KabirC,Will be either Livingston or Andre.
KabirC,"Rosalyn Gold-Onwude ‏@ROSGO21  

Rockets taking the Oprah approach to 3-point shooting right now:
""You get a 3! And you get a 3! And you get a 3!!!!"""
KabirC,How was that a foul on Andre? Are you kidding me?
KabirC,"Offensive foul, really?"
KabirC,"Bob Myers: ""It looks like things should be okay""

Hopefully nothing pops up tomorrow "
KabirC,"Flying knee to the head should be a flagrant, regardless of intent."
KabirC,"For the Warriors, not a chance. Already have Draymond. 

This is a terrible question to ask right now, huge recency bias."
KabirC,"Fast Break @GSWFastBreak

Memphis winning the pyrotechnic war, with flames off the top of the baskets and scoreboard."
KabirC,"Part of it is pace, they slow the game down a ton. Also, they have big guys scoring in the paint, lots of contact that goes uncalled on big guys"
KabirC,Should be pissed off at his team and pissed off at Joey Crawford for reffing it terribly right now
KabirC,"Rockets fans, going to make a video of Dwight pulling Klay away from Harden?"
KabirC,Most awkward shot of all time by Festus
KabirC,David Lee just putting his hands up...
KabirC,"Lee with Calathes on Barnes likely, that's what Grizz fans have been saying"
KabirC,"Gotta give it back to Conley, but at this rate, we'll be called for a foul"
KabirC,"Dray 0-3 to start the game, 2 wide open 3s and a missed lay-up"
KabirC,"Warriors foul trouble

Thompson 5

Barnes 4

Barbosa 4

Iguodala 3"
KabirC,Hawks are on fire from 3
KabirC,"God damn it, just grab that rebound, was in your hands."
KabirC,He should have gone through concussion testing.
KabirC,Him and Klay
KabirC,Klay starts getting hot and we put in Barbosa
KabirC,"No they really haven't, they're shooting 36%. Just getting a ton of FTs"
KabirC,"God fucking damn it, how do we have Scott Foster. That dude is just TERRIBLE"
KabirC,Will be the 6th highest paid after Draymond gets his extension.
KabirC,"Stop feeding Klay, he's off"
KabirC,"Ron Adams* not Kerr, but yeah that was just freaking amazing."
KabirC,Dwight's getting frustrated
KabirC,Refs are getting into the game now...
KabirC,Somehow people still don't realize the Warriors have the #1 defense in the NBA. Defense is what the Warriors are best at.
KabirC,"Just got elbowed in the face, not surprising"
KabirC,For getting fouled?
KabirC,Kerr's pissed at them
KabirC,"Nothing, he hugged Ariza afterwards "
KabirC,Harden pushes off and then misses the easy lay-up
KabirC,We haven't even reached the break in between the conference finals and the finals...
KabirC,"Dellavedova pushed off the ground before he went into Horford, that dude is earning his dirty reputation. "
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe  

Warriors up 17 though shooting just 43.2 percent. Why? They’re holding the Rockets to 30.6 percent"
KabirC,Max
KabirC,"Curry/Thompson

17 points, 6-for-7 FGs

Grizzlies

14 points, 6-for-17 FGs"
KabirC,"Once you see his posts around, you'll see why he gets negative karma."
KabirC,Dwight Howard is shooting better from the line (8-13) than from the field (4-11).
KabirC,Scott Foster hates Draymond. Steph made the 3 afterwards too
KabirC,They pull Ariza off Steph?
KabirC,"Warriors are playing at the Grizz pace, gonna lose easily if we keep that up. If the refs call fewer fouls in the 2nd half, we'll be back at our pace."
KabirC,"You guys hugged, grabbed and scratched him at any point possible."
KabirC,"Klay's off on his first open 3, not a good sign for the rest of the quarter"
KabirC,They had the missed Livingston foul lead to a 3 and 1 for Ariza earlier
KabirC,What was Gortat doing going to the paint? Let him have 2
KabirC,He was moving...
KabirC,Klay helping for no reason
KabirC,"Get Klay the fuck out of this game, he's fucking garbage tonight."
KabirC,"Someone's angry, better hope your boss doesn't find this one."
KabirC,Harden just flopped on defense lol
KabirC,"Feed Barnes and Klay if you want to shoot 3s, other guys stop taking 3s."
KabirC,"Teams try to trap Steph, but Draymond is too good of a playmaker for other teams to do that"
KabirC,Because we are leaving him wide open.
KabirC,"How's your ear?

WHAT?"
KabirC,"AHAHAHAHAHA, now he has"
KabirC,"In the Bay Area, which is really progressive compared to most places, ""gay"" was definitely used as an insult until like 4 or 5 years ago. Dray is dumb as hell for tweeting that homophobic stuff."
KabirC,"Warriors have gone against AD, Gasol and Dwight in the paint so far. "
KabirC,"After 3 games: https://twitter.com/ThompsonScribe/status/592114988166283267

Can't find game 4 right now, but Draymond killed AD in that series."
KabirC,35 seconds
KabirC,Are the Grizz trying to play some match-up? Z-Bo on Barnes?
KabirC,"He wasn't all that good this year guarding Steph, don't know how much of an effect he'd have coming off the injury."
KabirC,Baseball and football start on time. Basketball and hockey never do.
KabirC,"Two things, Warriors aren't in the finals yet and Draymond is not going to be the primary defender on LeBron, that'll be Barnes/Andre while Draymond, Livingston and Klay will all give different looks on him."
KabirC,Dray missing shots
KabirC,Over the back as well
KabirC,"So r/nba, where's the ref uproar?"
KabirC,"Fucking BS, 2nd foul and a tech. Scott Foster is one of the worst refs in the NBA"
KabirC,All wide open shots
KabirC,"Dwight was one of the only guys actually trying last night, eventually everyone got demoralized as is expected."
KabirC,"For most of the year, we were the cinderella team that everyone loved. Then people started realizing the team wasn't a hot team, and were actually good"
KabirC,"Curry is now 8 of 11 from behind the arc, 2 of 10 from inside it"
KabirC,"He's on and off, right now his shot is off."
KabirC,"Most people associate the Warriors with offense, not often with defense. "
KabirC,"Draymond, you had HB wide open in the corner."
KabirC,"Kyrie can't guard Klay, so either he'll be on Steph or they try to hide him on Barnes. "
KabirC,"Yeah, that's not close to being true."
KabirC,"Well Conley is holding on for dear life to him, can't really blame him for trying to get a call. "
KabirC,Would probably be if we go small. Depends on how Bogut is feeling and playing
KabirC,"Wow, didn't even hear that whistle, it's loud there"
KabirC,"If you want to correct for the refs, we'd be up by 15 or so"
KabirC,You seen your username?
KabirC,Are you seriously complaining about the refs?
KabirC,Man that Klay 3 would have been huge
KabirC,6 turnovers for the Grizzlies and 5 for the Warriors.
KabirC,"I would have said us before the playoffs, but that seems to have changed once we got into the playoffs."
KabirC,Wow CP3
KabirC,"No date announced yet, possibly before game 2?"
KabirC,His season basically did. 
KabirC,"Yeah, that was way back when. The 2 most recent games you guys had DMo and Bev with Brewer and Josh Smith on the bench. Your starting line-up in the playoffs is worse but your bench is better."
KabirC,Harden got caught watching the ball again
KabirC,MVP ceremony should get everyone in the game early
KabirC,That was the least of the moving screens in this game
KabirC,"It's great to use, especially in Cavs threads"
KabirC,Joey Crawford missing blatant calls and then getting mad when someone calls him on it. Come on you piece of shit
KabirC,"Could have dropped a behind the back like he normally does, easy dunk for Barnes"
KabirC,"You've been saying that about every series lol, when are you gonna give it up?"
KabirC,Why were they doubling Harden there?
KabirC,Looks like McHale's complaining worked
KabirC,And Andre would have to go.
KabirC,End of shot clock
KabirC,This game is now over
KabirC,rooting for* 
KabirC,"Andre needs to stop taking 3s right now, just drive and pass"
KabirC,"Yeah, would be much more understandable with Wall in there, this is pretty surprising."
KabirC,Will Beno play with the starters? That'll be interesting to see how they handle that match up
KabirC,"If they hack Bogut, Warriors will let him go to the line. He shoots FTs at a rate that would put us at the top playoff offense."
KabirC,4th missed open 3. 0 made.
KabirC,"You've been complaining since you guys got eliminated, give it a rest."
KabirC,"He's getting weakass foul calls too, then goes strong like that last play"
KabirC,"Good job Joey, acknowledging your mistake"
KabirC,"Clear path foul, fuck Thompson."
KabirC,Have any stats to back-up that claim?
KabirC,"Draymond just got thrown out of the play, how is that not a foul?"
KabirC,So this is what it feels like when Steph and Klay go supernova
KabirC,Movement
KabirC,That ball movement
KabirC,He never played Draymond at the 4 until the playoffs when all 3 of our centers got injured and David Lee had to play center against DeAndre Jordan.
KabirC,"If Barnes/Andre/Dray hold him to a sub 40% FG percentage, we've won that battle. Have to capitalize on his turnovers and play Warriors basketball on offense instead of trying to get all flashy and turn the ball over like crazy."
KabirC,Should have been a foul on the push of Gortat
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

Upside of Curry's Iverson sleeve: Looks super cool. Downside: He's shooting like Iverson"
KabirC,"Ok, game's close. Refs let's call it fair now."
KabirC,Grizz are fouling on every loose ball
KabirC,"im pretty sure it is where you take off, otherwise any running 3 pointer would technically be closer than the 3 point line."
KabirC,What's the difference between the last game roster in the regular season and your roster now other than missing Bev and DMo in the starting line-up?
KabirC,"No, why should he? Should have been called a foul, but nothing more"
KabirC,Such a stupid schedule
KabirC,Because Lee is terrible on defense and offense. 
KabirC,"Rockets fans, going to complain about that moving screen by Dwight?"
KabirC,I think Kerr pissed in their cereal this morning.
KabirC,Would like to see a replay of that.
KabirC,Vomiting can occur from vertigo which can occur because of internal ear damage. 
KabirC,They chanting MVP for Harden?
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe 

Grizzlies shooting 50 percent (8 of 16) and down 7"
KabirC,GAME.
KabirC,"After the Livingston tech, no. Joey Crawford gets too emotional about his reffing"
KabirC,That should be a Flagrant 2
KabirC,"Warriors weren't going to miss as many shots as they did in 2 and 3, regressed to the mean."
KabirC,How's Adams defense? Nowhere near TA
KabirC,"CP3

Tony Allen

Kawhi Leonard

Draymond Green

Andrew Bogut"
KabirC,"Even if he hits his shots at a 40% rate, Warriors will take it because Bogut is cleaning up everything in the paint. Z-Bo beat Barnes to start the game and Bogut came over and easily cleaned it up."
KabirC,Steph's missed a lot of easy lay-ups 
KabirC,"Oh shit, really? I hadn't seen any other posts about this!"
KabirC,Miggy and Verlander are to your right
KabirC,Slight grab around the waist
KabirC,Draymond has played terrible so far
KabirC,That wasn't a foul? Klay got killed from behind
KabirC,Freddie Freeman does it all the time
KabirC,Where's HB at?
KabirC,"They're not going to call any off the ball holds, it's infuriating, but that's basketball"
KabirC,"Harden doesn't get called for fouls, obvious foul on Draymond"
KabirC,"Andre would win that, both are close on defense, but Andre is a better offensive player. A hell of a lot misses on offense lol"
KabirC,"Oh man, if that went in"
KabirC,Harden hugging Barnes leg
KabirC,"Not yet, there's still Joey Crawford"
KabirC,In this game Barnes is 0-9 and Klay is 6-16 and the Warriors are up by 31
KabirC,"Damn, Howard hung up there for a whlie"
KabirC,"Come on Bogut, gotta step it up."
KabirC,"How the hell do Crawford, Brothers and Foster continue to ref important games?"
KabirC,"He used to take FIBA 3s and all too, but his elbow injury destroyed his shot completely. "
KabirC,"For the first 2 games, yeah. But for the last 2 games, that's not all right. Josh Smith and Corey Brewer were there, but so were DMo and Beverley. My last post just talks about differences."
KabirC,"Warrior sloppy again, god damn it"
KabirC,STEPH!
KabirC,"Draymond isn't hitting 3s, we're in trouble."
KabirC,"It can't be both? Klay had 3 or 4 wide open threes he missed, the missed dunk, weird one foot running 3. Tony Allen is a great on ball defender, but off the ball he has a lot of holes"
KabirC,"Millsap isn't starting over Draymond, Carroll isn't starting over Barnes (Warriors also have Andre coming off the bench) and Horford wouldn't start over Bogut because of the Warriors system requiring elite defense from their center."
KabirC,"Steph missed a like 3 or 4 shots he should have made pretty easily, but he took a lot of hard shots. Had 1 half time buzzer heave, one at the end of the 3rd and then 2 or 3 at the end of the game that were tough shots. Conley balled out though.

Klay had an off night"
KabirC,Heat check lol
KabirC,"He probably wouldn't come back until a game 7 if necessary, if there's nothing broken."
KabirC,"What the hell Livingston, you idiot"
KabirC,Just watch your guards and Ariza off the ball against Klay and Steph
KabirC,"I did the math the other day haha, Draymond getting the max of around 17 million, it all would work out. Our bench would be depleted. Livingston-Holiday-free agent-McAdoo-Ezeli"
KabirC,"Yeah it's a smart decision. For us let Steph and LeBron's scoring cancel each other out, play for our ""other guys"" to beat their ""other guys"" which on paper we definitely should.

It wasn't Kerr that went to the footage though, Ron Adams just suggested putting Bogut on TA like during game 2 or on the plane to Memphis and then they decided to implement it in game 4. Ron Adams is a freaking defensive god."
KabirC,"$42 million for Durant and Steph for the first year and then goes up to $60 million for Durant and Steph in 2017, can be structured easily to work the salary cap. $34 million for Klay and Dray. $11 million for Bogut. Salary cap would be $108 million. Bench would be $5 million Livingston, $5 million Ezeli, $1.2 McAdoo, $1.2 Holiday and then some other guys. Luxury tax is at $130 or so if I remember right.  "
KabirC,"He never went out, that's a terrible call."
KabirC,Please get Steph out of this game
KabirC,"Bogut put the jets on Howard and then gets the oop, are we sure he didn't steal Dwight's power?"
KabirC,He already got x-rays
KabirC,6
KabirC,"Josh Smith tripped Klay afterwards, balanced out."
KabirC,"It still exists. Memphis series was about a great defense vs a great offense, a lot of people didn't realize the Warriors were the #1 defense."
KabirC,"Nah, they actually won a championship."
KabirC,Warriors aren't having anywhere near their regular season success in the 3rd
KabirC,"Yup, OP is shadowbanned"
KabirC,Maybe the best player in the NBA
KabirC,Why would you try an alley-oop over Dwight? 
KabirC,"Not at all, Russ is on his rookie contract, Steph isn't."
KabirC,"That's why, he's missing the DPOY."
KabirC,"LOL, you won't call that charge refs?"
KabirC,He lost 5 (6 if he made the FT) because of either ref incompetency or just an unfortunate foul off the ball. Harden definitely played better though.
KabirC,"This is from 2010, when Draymond was 20 and in college"
KabirC,How do you let him get such good position 
KabirC,"Did you watch the games? Hell, even the Warriors acknowledged it. He tore apart their transition game."
KabirC,Only a flagrant one? Are you kidding me? 
KabirC,Klay come on!!
KabirC,Steph's getting killed on defense
KabirC,"No, Beverley was not nearly as good this year on defense as he had been. When you add DMo you lose minutes from Josh Smith, have to figure out how to manage all those minutes."
KabirC,"He's one of the highest paid assistants in the NBA already, he's not leaving for money."
KabirC,Steph is still eating Nick Johnson though
KabirC,Dwight threw Andre earlier
KabirC,"Don't know what to tell you then, can check out any of the Warriors beat writers too. Marcus Thompson wrote a good article on his defense this year. Steph primarily guarded PGs, Russ, Paul, or whoever it is. They gave another look with Klay on a PG, but Steph was the primary guy."
KabirC,"LOL, refs wanted to keep Barnes in the game"
KabirC,"Not really, they have played 19 games according to /u/lightbulb17 while LeBron has played 20 and Steph has played 15.

Edit: LeBron has played 28 games, not 20. Just checked it."
KabirC,Not calling any fouls right now
KabirC,Bogues nailing both FTs!
KabirC,"Get Klay out of the game, bring in Barbosa."
KabirC,"Yup, Lacob could go into the luxury tax every year and still be turning a huge profit with the what you said plus championships."
KabirC,"These fouls are ridiculous, Harden's out there hacking everyone"
KabirC,"Clippers tried it against us this season, Kerr was ready and the rest of the team tore them to shreds."
KabirC,"BS, should have been our ball after someone went under Steph on the rebound"
KabirC,"Shit, might as well give the MVP to Russ then"
KabirC,"Delly was going down normally, but he pushed off with his foot once he realized what was going on."
KabirC,Sometimes he doesn't change his game and he gets frustrated and keeps trying to draw fouls. That's what happened in game 3.
KabirC,Looks like McHale told Johnson to hold on to everything and see if they call it
KabirC,"In a few minutes he's going to go through his posts and delete them all.

Edit: Like I said, he deleted his posts."
KabirC,Nice flop by Gasol
KabirC,Why the hell is DeAndre fouling Dwight? Wasting fouls on DJ
KabirC,Are you kidding me with that foul? He was straight up and backing up
KabirC,"Steph's still off, but Klay's looking much better."
KabirC,Draymond has freaking killed it in the playoffs
KabirC,"Don't know why the Warriors are promoting having him there, really bad PR."
KabirC,"Damn, that was impressive by Blake"
KabirC,"No, the dude has been hating Steph all game long"
KabirC,"Calvin Watkins ‏@calvinwatkins  

Steve Kerr is freaking upset. That's putting it as clean as I can. Yelled at Joey Crawford and is steamed.

As he should be"
KabirC,"http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Draymond-Green-5859/

7'1.25"
KabirC,"Ethan Strauss ‏@SherwoodStrauss  

Walked past Jason Terry's incredible (and unprintable) pregame huddle speech. Seems like JET's Houston's emotional leader"
KabirC,Did they just call a fucking off the ball foul? Are you kidding me? Just watch Conley on Steph.
KabirC,"The way he hit his head from that high up, I do think so."
KabirC,"I wonder if they'll call that Harden pushoff, extremely obvious"
KabirC,Patting himself*
KabirC,"Dray's getting a max, going into the luxury next year. Barnes is up after next year, cap goes up and Lee comes off the books. They'll be back next year."
KabirC,"Steph also runs off the ball a ton, Warriors would abuse that and just run LeBron like crazy."
KabirC,If only DeAndre actually practiced his free throws the Clippers would be winning this game
KabirC,"We've had much better injury luck than anyone else, but Speights isn't the only injury we've had all year. Not even close."
KabirC,Dray should have been called for that one
KabirC,Only player who hasn't airballed a shot for the Warriors on this line-up is Bogut
KabirC,"One time is an accident (Taj), two times is a coincidence (Korver), three times is a pattern (Horford)."
KabirC,I think most of those misses came in 1 game where his floater was off and he missed like 2 or 3 easy floaters.
KabirC,"Draymond*, and they haven't called it on the other end either"
KabirC,Would depend on what Barnes want. A bridge contract would be easily doable. And depends if the Warriors step into the FA market or not.
KabirC,I'd rather him not come back tonight
KabirC,"Something like this:

1. LeBron

2. Steph

3. Klay

4. Draymond

5. Iguodala

6. Bogut

7. Barnes

8. Injured Kyrie

9. Mozgov

10. TT

11. JR

12. Shumpert

6 players from each team, that look about what you were thinking? "
KabirC,"He's taking 11 attempts a game, was hitting them at like a 55% rate in one series. "
KabirC,"I don't think that's how the Grizz wanted to start the game, a 3 by Randolph"
KabirC,"Yup, it's insane. Which is why making sure we don't help that much off perimeter shooters and staying disciplined like in this series is what needs to be done."
KabirC,"Clutch, but just too late. Won't count"
KabirC,"Yes, because it is that simple to abuse Bogut and Draymond."
KabirC,"Lots of people don't see him as good, he played pretty damn well though for most of the games."
KabirC,Dwight is killing Ezeli on these fakes
KabirC,Or if they just hit their open shots...
KabirC,Enes Kanter and Jamal Crawford are probably on that team
KabirC,"You've said that since you guys played him. Your guards and wings tried it, Grizz have tried it too."
KabirC,2 minutes left
KabirC,"Come on Steph, that's the easiest shot you've taken lol"
KabirC,"Oh man, that's rough. He shouldn't be at Oracle for Game 2, should be put through concussion protocol as well because it's sounding rough."
KabirC,"Marcus Thompson ‏@ThompsonScribe

Rockets official complains about Warriors giving out Strength In Numbers shirts to fans in the building. Called it ""unprofessional"""
KabirC,Setting a screen
KabirC,They said foul on Tony Allen
KabirC,"Damn, Barnes has missed 2 of those floaters"
KabirC,"You remember the game against you guys? Yeah, this one is bordering that."
KabirC,"Scared of the Klay shot, Barnes gets the easy dunk."
KabirC,"Julie Phayer ‏@juliephayer  

Toyota center playing  CoCo right before Dubs come out"
KabirC,"Speights or Festus would probably play when Lee went down, Jackson never tried Draymond at the 4 once last year."
KabirC,Go to the Game Thread and post a comment in the Game Thread.
KabirC,"On the other hand:

Steph and Klay won't have as little of an effect as they did in the 1st half

Grizzlies defense has left a lot of guys wide open for easy looks

Warriors had 9 turnovers compared to the Grizzlies 6 turnovers"
KabirC,Steph just looked at that fan who tried to yell on that three after he hit it 
KabirC,"It took Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli and Jermaine O'Neal all being injured for it to come to that."
KabirC,Do the Wizards not know how to communicate on defense? Wow this is pathetic defense haha
KabirC,"If you want it called every time, Harden will get called for it a lot more often. Steph rarely steps back/pushes off"
KabirC,Damn John Wall
KabirC,Joey Crawford has been putrid tonight
KabirC,"Curry is now 7 of 10 from behind the arc, 2 of 10 from inside it"
KabirC,"That was a major travel, come on refs."
KabirC,"Yes, because the Bulls are in the same conversation as the Warriors offensively..."
KabirC,"Very frustrating, often times off a stupid mistake from the Dubs like the Harrison Barnes dropepd pass"
KabirC,"Yeah, because he's never hit important shots to win a game..."
KabirC,Stretcher coming out
KabirC,"Most of that was in garbage time. But yeah added in Jones and Prigioni to the bench and lost DMo and Bev, right?"
KabirC,Barnes will post up Kyrie over and over and pass to the open man when help comes. Can't really hide a defender against the Warriors.
KabirC,But Kerr went to UofA
KabirC,"Fast Break ‏@GSWFastBreak  

Oracle not showing replay to crowd, because inciting riots is bad."
KabirC,Our passes are terrible right now
KabirC,"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut all airballed a three pointer in this game"
KabirC,Festus has no hands or FT shooting in the playoffs
KabirC,"Howard just punched Bogut, flagrant 2 coming with contact to the head? I don't agree with it being a flagrant 2, but that's the precedent set"
KabirC,"That might be the break the Wiz need, looks like it avoided Sessions unless it hit his shorts"
KabirC,"That was a blatant push off on Gasol, refs are definitely helping out the Grizzlies in this quarter"
KabirC,Offensive foul and then a flop
KabirC,"That was complete garbage by the Warriors, how the fuck do you expect to win playing like that? Missing shot after shot, defense missing guys, not getting rebounds, stupid turnovers, that was just terrible. "
KabirC,Gasol has hit two players in the face and drawn foul calls on both.
KabirC,Taking a book out of what the Rockets were doing with that pocket pass
KabirC,Sloppy turnovers still plaguing us
KabirC,Warriors are going to run Conley hard screens from Dray and Bogut almost guaranteed. Nothing dirty or illegal
KabirC,How'd Harden do yesterday?
KabirC,"Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83  

Tony Allen didn't look up at the Jr. Jam Squad, then stood face to face with The Money Team."
KabirC,"Clippers have Jamal, JJ and CP3 to take the FTs, that's definitely a nice thing."
KabirC,"Steph, Livingston, Draymond and Barnes were the only guys who played well last night. Bogut and Klay were pretty bad, Lee was downright terrible, Andre was completely off and Barbosa didn't help out at all on offense. Shot 7/24 on open threes as well. Definitely places to improve, but can't expect Livingston to have a similar performance like this."
KabirC,"He's going against Bogut on defense, not Green. Draymond is on Gasol. And Draymond just needs to hit his wide open 3s that he's going to get"
KabirC,"Mirotic talking shit after he does that, that's just stupid."
KabirC,Green 4 assists and 3 rebounds shy of a triple double
KabirC,Seriously refs?
KabirC,That was an over the back on TA
KabirC,Klay has still been terrible
KabirC,Missed goaltend on Dwight and then the ball was off Curry but they missed that too
KabirC,"If the Pelicans finish above the 6 spot and there is no historic season like the Warriors, it will be AD. Otherwise KD or Steph."
KabirC,"I don't even think there's a question at PF, it's Draymond. He earned the most votes 1st place for DPOY, center is the only spot up."
KabirC,Looks like McHale's complaining has caused the refs to call everything
KabirC,Gasol was moving
KabirC,Brewer just pulled him down
KabirC,"Dude, they are up 16 in the first quarter"
KabirC,"Thanks, NBA."
KabirC,"Please get Ezeli in the game, Lee should not be playing"
KabirC,"Both, Warriors stopped with the stupid turnovers and picked up the defense. Started with using other guys on Harden along with Klay, giving him different looks including Andre and Barnes. Warriors came out strong and built a nice lead until Steph broke their morale."
KabirC,Because he's not one of the 3 best defensive centers in the league...
KabirC,Ahahahahahhahahaha the Dodgers...
KabirC,He was pushed down by Harden on his three and then by Dwight on the rebound
KabirC,"On that screen? Lol it was hard screen, no ankle breaking there"
KabirC,"Yup, looked like a bit of both"
KabirC,"Well, that's because he said the winner of game 4 would win the series. He had to say the Warriors."
KabirC,DEFENSE!!
KabirC,"Yeah, the uproar just died down completely. "
KabirC,He's missed like 3 shots haha
KabirC,$89 million in 2016 then $108 in 2017 then down to $100 in 2018.
KabirC,64 of 143
KabirC,Did Terrence Jones just give Dray a low five?
KabirC,"Right before Harden got his first points (those are the two time markers I see in Twitter haha).

Last 3:30"
KabirC,Try to play big against the Warriors small ball?
KabirC,Ok Rockets are just throwing Andre around now
KabirC,Harden just smacked Andre on that fast break
KabirC,Horford's now extra wondering why he got ejected
KabirC,Did Vince just run over Livingston?
KabirC,Because Adams handles every aspect of the defense
KabirC,Anyone else see Crawford getting mad at Harden after the blocked shot and trying to grab him ?
KabirC,Drop the head and power through
KabirC,"&gt; Since those last 2 games, the Rockets lost Beverley and D-Mo from the starting line-up and inserted Jason Terry and Josh Smith while adding Prigioni and Terrence Jones to the bench.
"
KabirC,He's been BAD since the Pelicans series
KabirC,Come on Festus...
KabirC,WTF Steph
KabirC,"That's a terrible idea, Steph is an elite scorer, CP3 is an elite facilitator. CP3 can't take over games like Steph can or with the same frequency. Add in the fact that even with good defense the Warriors get a lot of open looks, it is a recipe for failure."
KabirC,"That Barbosa 3 was so frustrating, would have brought the lead down to 3 but he missed an open shot"
KabirC,"If someone taunts, that's a tech. But we have no idea what was said. They will be overly cautious after what Teague did in the first."
KabirC,Everyone other than Klay has been pretty fine. But Klay has killed their offense when he touches the ball and lost Ariza for a 3
KabirC,"LOL, says the Cavs fan..."
KabirC,"Concussion symptoms don't always come on immediately, the delayed concussion is what most people were worried about."
KabirC,"Oh you definitely could, it happened all throughout the 3rd quarter."
KabirC,"Marc J. Spears ‏@SpearsNBAYahoo 

Mike Conley hit in face by Draymond Green in fight for ball. Conley said before game he had not been hit in the face yet. Grizzlies peeved."
KabirC,Terry just went at Draymond. Rockets are so mentally soft
KabirC,3*-1 against the Clippers
KabirC,"I thikn everyone remembers that, the circlejerk was strong "
KabirC,"They let some contact go. Conley and the other guards hold on to Steph and Klay when they're running off the ball and that doesn't get called. Bogut, Z-Bo, Draymond and Gasol all use a ton of moving screens."
KabirC,"Even if TA makes some shots, they'd leave him open. The alternative is Randolph banging it in the paint or Gasol drawing a foul. TA will miss a hell of a lot more than he will make."
KabirC,"Refs, stop calling these ticky tack fouls and just let this game end"
KabirC,"That was a foul on Barnes, was being grabbed on that pass"
KabirC,"In the December 10th game, was not injured for either of these games."
KabirC,"He still shoots it at 35% overall, 37% on wide open threes. That's 1.11 points a possession."
KabirC,4 point swing after that terrible call
KabirC,They are probably measuring from where he released to basket rather than where he took off which is what most shots are measure by.
KabirC,"If it does happen, Warriors would be the team to beat for the next 7 or so years. Two top 5 players in the league and then Klay Thompson who is like top 25 and then an elite defensive player in Draymond and Bogut until he retires."
KabirC,Priogioni was all over Steph
KabirC,That was a clear goaltend
KabirC,He was still moving 
KabirC,"Yes, because that one flop means he's a flopper. "
KabirC,"Grizz starting:

G - Nick Calathes

G - Courtney Lee

F - Tony Allen

F - Zach Randolph

C - Marc Gasol
"
KabirC,"Under Jackson, Draymond never played as a PF."
KabirC,Why not Ezeli?
KabirC,Draymond absolutely destroys Blake.
KabirC,It was fine until he pushed off at the end and then went into Horford.
KabirC,"Dubs have 11 turnovers, Grizzlies have 9 turnovers. Don't know how many points off turnovers at the half though"
KabirC,"Don't know bout the rest, but it is Scott Foster. He's one of the worst refs in the NBA"
KabirC,Was there body contact there? 
KabirC,What happens when he runs into a hard screen
KabirC,"Diamond Leung ‏@diamond83  

Rockets cheerleaders are handing out the supposedly homemade signs in the arena to fans, one of which reads ""Rockets Power Dancers are Hot."""
KabirC,What extra shot?
KabirC,Need height and length on him and lateral quickness.
KabirC,"Iguodala, maybe Livingston, would have to go in that offseason, they would be be in the luxury tax and then under the cap. but wouldn't have much of a bench, if one at all."
KabirC,Yeah that was an obvious 3 second call
KabirC,2 near turnovers turn into a Steph 3
KabirC,"Harden is shooting 69.2% from midrange, it's insane"
KabirC,"That's a bad call, but he finished it anyways. "
KabirC,"Yeah and they also drop kick the ball, Kerr is the best at that."
KabirC,"You had Josh Smith for the last 2 games, just checked it up. For the 131-106 game Rockets starters were Beverly-Harden-Ariza-DMo-Dwight with Smith, Brewer and Terry as the top 3 off the bench. For the 126-113 game the starters were Beverly-Harden-Ariza-DMo-Dwight with Brewer, Terry, Dorsey and Papanikoalau off the bench with Josh Smith getting ejected in that game after getting 2 techs."
KabirC,"Harden entered the game tonight in all black, he knows what's up.

https://twitter.com/MusikFan4Life/status/602986362132942848"
KabirC,Epic clock failure
KabirC,That Steph 3 started with Harden helping on the Dray drive
KabirC,Did they just call a foul there? Are you serious?
KabirC,That's like 4 steps on that drive
KabirC,Is Harden calling for a flop there?
KabirC,"GSWStats ‏@gswstats  

Game 1: Rockets lead by 16, Warriors end half on a 25-6 run

Game 2: Warriors lead by 17, Rockets end half on a 23-6 run"
KabirC,"Warriors had 21 turnovers in the game, only 22 assists on 38 made field goals, got outrebounded, took less shots and dominated because they hit some of their open shots this game."
KabirC,DRAYMOND!!! We needed that 3
KabirC,That was like 4 steps across the lane
KabirC,How the fuck is that a foul? Z-Bo is just running around trying to draw a foul
KabirC,Are you not going to call the Allen grabbing Klay's jersey?
KabirC,"Draymond Green also averages 1 foul every 9.7 minutes with Foster while only 1 foul every 36 minutes for all other referees. At first this stat doesn't make sense, then you remember there are 2 or 3 refs per a game.

Edit: Ray Ratto ‏@RattoCSN  

Scott Foster's home record (1-9) is impressive but unless he kills Zach Zarba (6-3) and Jason Phillips (4-4), jump to no conclusions."
KabirC,"He was being grabbed while his defender was down, couldn't get separation. "
KabirC,Such a useless foul on Bogues 
KabirC,Steph Curry. Warriors have a much better team and Steph's playing a ton better than Harden in these playoffs.
KabirC,"Be a stretch 4 and run the fastbreak, he's a pretty good passer as well. High BBIQ."
KabirC,"I'm still pissed about Dwight being in this game, and Bogut just came out of the game, hope he's not injured."
KabirC,Belinelli got fouled on that shot too
KabirC,"There's almost no chance LeBron would actually guard Steph in this series for elongated periods of time, I'd be extremely surprised if they try that. I don't know if you'd want him on Klay either since Klay's going to be running around everywhere off the ball. So then he's left to guard Barnes/Andre."
KabirC,"Well, that's not how GS won 67 games. Need the best defense in the NBA to go along with elite shooting and scoring."
KabirC,67.4% in the regular season
KabirC,"Joey, give Dwight a tech to make up for your terrible officiating "
KabirC,Randolph is literally doing everything he can and hitting all the shots he's taking
KabirC,Rockets switch on every pick and roll rather than fighting through screens. Even if they did have a fully healthy Bev with no injury history they'd be stuck with a similar predicament.
KabirC,Just barely got the wrist
KabirC,Just a little late...
KabirC,Gasol carried that out of bounds.
KabirC,That's what I thought
KabirC,"Rockets fans, going to complain about Dwight pushing off? Fouls go both ways, refs won't call everything"
KabirC,The anti-Warriors circlejerk died down real quick
KabirC,52-0
KabirC,Yeah he learned from his last ankle injury. A controlled fall is much safer than potentially landing on someone's foot and rolling your ankle. 
KabirC,"Yup, that support from the bench is invaluable"
KabirC,Kerr's going to get a T in this game for sure
KabirC,"This was definitely worthy of its own post, not a comment on the Game Thread."
KabirC,"Draymond has been killing him all series long, he's been very inefficient. Z-Bo is a monster though"
KabirC,"Curry and the Warriors have to be better at handling the desperation traps

Need options to pass to"
KabirC,Shhhh
KabirC,Grizz are shooting 52% 11-21 and 2-3 on 3s so far. Warriors are shooting 65% 13-20 and 4-9 on 3s so far.
KabirC,"That's what I thought, replay showed just 2 steps"
KabirC,Takes a push from the back from Gasol and Z-Bo to finally get FTs
KabirC,"LeBron isn't going to score 100 points by himself, have to focus on the rest of the guys and making sure they don't score efficiently."
KabirC,Steph only played 36 minutes in this game and had 40 points on 19 shots with 5 rebounds and 7 assists.
KabirC,"Pelicans did that to Steph last series, but with a lot more grabbing. "
KabirC,Ezeli should be in this line-up for Lee. At least provides good defense and rim protection. 
KabirC,"Yup, saw that and fixed it, thanks"
KabirC,Blackhawks 3-2
KabirC,Should have been
KabirC,"Draymond has played a lot of great defense on him, but Gasol has also been missing a lot of shots."
KabirC,2 of the 4 games
KabirC,"You realize that Bogut and Green are both better defenders than DJ, right?"
KabirC,Steph had an open 3 if that pass was on point
KabirC,The rule is away from the play.
KabirC,OH MY GOD STEPH!
KabirC,Tried throwing a body at Steph after the foul
KabirC,Harden trying to start shit with Ezeli lol
KabirC,I smell Curry cooking
KabirC,Not calling shit for the Warriors
KabirC,What are you talking about? Warriors fans aren't complaining about reffing...
KabirC,He's not lol
KabirC,Lots of fans
KabirC,Klay with his 2nd stupid foul on Dwight
KabirC,Warriors playing terrible so far
KabirC,Bogut had Dray wide open for a dunk
KabirC,"Steph got a little too selfish, wanted the last shot instead of passing out of the double team."
KabirC,"If our bench comes in, who do you put him on still? Livingston posting him up? Barbosa using his speed and blowing by? "
KabirC,"Steph new that was in as soon as he shot it, started to head on back!"
KabirC,Warriors supporting cast is MUCH better than the Clippers supporting cast.
KabirC,$30 million a year for people who didn't get that
KabirC,Damn that was just a lucky bounce
KabirC,Warriors need more ball movement 
KabirC,Surprised Steph missed that.
KabirC,"He's the dude that randomly lit our asses up, right? "
KabirC,A 5 day rest shouldn't make you this rusty.
KabirC,Ahahah people are really salty 
KabirC,"No. AD is absolutely insane, he's the #3 player in the NBa right now. Blake is not better than him."
KabirC,"Not really, that fan was getting in his face on his shots"
KabirC,They are leaving Iggy wide open
KabirC,Brothers hates the Warriors
KabirC,"Everyone is saying Josh Smith and Corey Brewer didn't play against the Warriors in the 2 latest games, just wanted to clear up that they did and with the Rockets 2 starters injured their bench has been somewhat shortened. Not overconfident about this series at all, they've still got a good team."
KabirC,Terry just flopped out of bounds
KabirC,"Refs haven't helped the Warriors out at all this quarter, not going to start now."
KabirC,So the Warriors are still 0-2 in v2 of the game thread
KabirC,That was another terrible out of bounds call
KabirC,Jealous of the Roaracle already?
KabirC,What kind of pass was that
KabirC,"Well you'll be disappointed, will be Randolph and Bogut most of the time."
KabirC,"Hey, Harden got called for his pushoff"
KabirC,"/u/illtakethebox 2 points 5 days ago 

Where's the reggie Miller choke gif when you need it"
KabirC,They didn't 
KabirC,"Calathes won't guard Steph, most likely will be Tony Allen"
KabirC,Houston shooting 80% compared to the Warriors at 31%
KabirC,"Terry pushed Steph on that flip up too haha, damn that's crazy"
KabirC,Well when Jet is trying to flop everywhere...
KabirC,"Shhhhh, don't let anyone hear that. 

Seriously though, the question is if they'll play like it or not."
KabirC,"Been that way since the playoffs started, wasn't a problem before for me. Don't know what happened."
KabirC,Grizz with Z-Bo in game 7 against OKC and Cavs with JR Smith too. And Bulls fans with Taj Gibson.
KabirC,"Dray, what the hell was that!"
KabirC,"Bulls was OT, and the other was the Spurs one"
KabirC,According to TNT we are the Spurs now. Grizzlies and Spurs coming up next
KabirC,"That's a terrible call, that is an obvious block"
KabirC,"Klay's killed TA this year, will be interesting to see if that happens again this playoffs"
KabirC,Dwight didn't see it coming at all
KabirC,Scoreboard
KabirC,Barnes is such an improved rebounder
KabirC,"Your ""effort"" was a lot thanks to the refs"
KabirC,Klay started walking to the wrong bench hahaha
KabirC,I'd take Blake Griffin over Westbrook.
KabirC,"Clippers are going to lose because of mental mistakes, CP3 showing up clutch, the rest of the team is choking."
KabirC,Harden left Steph wide open for 3 but Harden didn't see him
KabirC,"Wow, that's embarrassing refereeing. One of the Hawks guys just shoved the Wizards defender and then Pierce got called for a foul after one ref called a charge and the other called a block."
KabirC,Funny how quickly everyone changes tunes now that the Dubs are up 3-2. It's just a 1 game lead lol
KabirC,Bang! Steph!
KabirC,"I'm with you on that, the comment I was responding to was about him tweeting it now if I remember correctly."
KabirC,"It is supposed to be $89 million, then to $108 then down to $100. In this scenario, Iguodala would be gone."
KabirC,"2 blown lay-ups, can't remember the 3rd shot"
KabirC,Harden's out here flopping everywhere
KabirC,"Bogut is considered one of the best, if not the best, defensive center in the league. Metrics and eye test verify that."
KabirC,"That was dirty, someone just went under Curry for a rebound."
KabirC,"Oh ok, then it's all good lol"
KabirC,Harden's mad.
KabirC,He definitely should not come back tonight.
KabirC,"No they should not, were up 3-1 in the series and then had a 19 point lead in an elimination game."
KabirC,"That game was ridiculous, he just kept putting up shots and they kept going in."
KabirC,Ezeli was the only guy contesting anyone's shot there
KabirC,"Just stupid turnovers, Curry had a lane to the basket."
KabirC,The Marc Gasol head drop to foul lol
KabirC,Harden tried doing his running rip through and lost the ball
KabirC,"Actually, I'm pretty sure he's a Clipper"
KabirC,"It took Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli and Jermaine O'Neal all being injured for Dray to play PF.
"
KabirC,"Yup, that's a legit foul"
KabirC,"What the hell Steph, that was a terrible turnover"
KabirC,No mental toughness tonight or last night
Mehberry,Well that was fast.
Mehberry,"Come on man, let's save the salt for chippy foul calls "
Mehberry,$5 for 20 nuggets is just unbeatable 
Mehberry,"I realize I'm still commenting here on the matter but the opinions of people related to players mean jack diddly shit. Unless Al wants to speak up, who cares about Anna?"
Mehberry,"Okay staying positive is one thing but Wall is not so much as touching a basketball with how much risk is at hand 

EDIT: unfortunate pun... :("
Mehberry,TIMEOUT GODDAMN IT
Mehberry,"That...what?

I know the joke of ""who thought this was a good idea"" gets tossed around but I'm pretty sure even the thickest of people are a bit unnerved by that."
Mehberry,If Nene gets called and Korver turns it out we still have 4 seconds for a 3 pointer. The Nene call was missed but we still got burned.
Mehberry,Great we got shitty Ramon tonight 
Mehberry,Tim Duncan never looks like he believes he's committed a foul
Mehberry,"Gortat is normally acceptable, he's just having a bad night. It's compounded by fellow shitty Wiz performance."
Mehberry,"As bad as this seems...we're only down 6.

I mean damn."
Mehberry,Noice
Mehberry,Yo that beef n cheddar is a delightful cardiac arrest
Mehberry,"Finally the bonus.

GIMME DEM FREE THROWS"
Mehberry,Law school eats souls for breakfast and GPA/class rank is everything. I'm strapping down that first year.
Mehberry,"Might I suggest instead a fresh Tuna Sandwich instead?

Seriously, Skiles? As anything more than an assistant? No thanks. "
Mehberry,*Never!*
Mehberry,BALL MOVEMENT!
Mehberry,HARDEN GOES HARD
Mehberry,Nope that's on Diaw first! 
Mehberry,The Noah greasebun tho
Mehberry,PAUL
Mehberry,Ahhh goddamn it JJ
Mehberry,"Alrighty!

1st Round: *East* 

Wizards: DeRozan (awkward choice, but at least we can rest Beal)

Hawks: Bropez by default, again, awkward choice to make. Can rest Horford and Paul though.

Cavs: probably Thomas. Better PG option than Delly, probably best overall Celtic anyway.

Bulls: I'd probably say Middleton. Closest thing the Bucks had to instant offense and the Bulls needed that bad.

2nd Round: *East*

Hawks: Wall. Teague has been awful and even a slightly injured Wall is a massive upgrade. 

Cavs: assuming they already took Thomas, probably a fresh big like Gibson or Gasol. Leaning towards Gasol for the sake of offensive production. 

3rd Round: *East*

Hawks: would take LeBron. Easy decision. 

Cavs: I think they would take Carroll here. JR and Shump aren't decent defenders, and Carroll is still competent offensively. If Korver was having a better postseason I'd say him, but that's an if. 
"
Mehberry,Maaaad microtransactions
Mehberry,BIG PANDA
Mehberry,"Yeah it was a typo, I made the post to say otherwise. Whoops."
Mehberry,"I will have ONE game 7 in the first round. 

LET ME HAVE ONE!"
Mehberry,"We need to tie by the 3 minute mark. Lingering teams don't take over at the last second.

Aka PUT GODDAMNED PIERCE IN"
Mehberry,You just know TNT is watching ESPN's dogshit handling of the playoffs and rubbing their hands like Birdman 
Mehberry,I like how they made the crash victims still look gorgeous even while crashing like it was a photo shoot 
Mehberry,GLIDING GORTAT AND-1's I MISSED YOU
Mehberry,Free Humphries!
Mehberry,"Wall Beal Otto Humphries Seraphin. 

NOW. Pierce isn't hitting shots and is getting roasted, Nene and Gortat are ass, and sweet Jesus fuck just play Kris Humphries he was probably our 3rd or 4th best player all year. "
Mehberry,"""Yeah let's just not feed Beal, our best offensive player on the team with Wall out"" "
Mehberry,Beal has minimum 2 airballs a game.
Mehberry,...no? Because we still did well in early games?
Mehberry,"Nate Rob is a little awkward, gotta improve his conversational flow. "
Mehberry,OTTOOOOO
Mehberry,Thank you Paul
Mehberry,"Ah yes, that marksman Mozgov"
Mehberry,Shumpert is trying to do WAY too much. Kyrie and LeBron getting treated like role players not getting the ball.
Mehberry,MY MAN OTTO PORTERRRR
Mehberry,"Or, you know, at all. I don't think he actually got a single minute."
Mehberry,LOL AN EVEN WORSE CALL
Mehberry,"John, please take coach suit shopping "
Mehberry,Nene you almost choked the shit out of that. Grab the fucking ball. 
Mehberry,"Shit possession, can't do that "
Mehberry,Nachos unite us all.
Mehberry,He averaged double digit scoring and decent rebounds last series. Better than Nene I think actually.
Mehberry,Got damn Baze
Mehberry,"I expected a no-call from some exaggeration, really not sure "
Mehberry,HOLY FUCK
Mehberry,...so close
Mehberry,If Ramon had drained that I'd be full mast 
Mehberry,I was gonna shit on him anyway but Nene is giving me LOTS of material.
Mehberry,Wrist injury
Mehberry,It was a shitty game when it was tied too
Mehberry,Sorry fam
Mehberry,"It's time to retire the ""ref you suck"" chant if arenas use it for every single call they don't like now "
Mehberry,Oh come on Paul
Mehberry,That's just not a very good ref you suck chant
Mehberry,Lol 59 seconds 
Mehberry,When Nene can't score he ruins the floor. He needs to come off the bench.
Mehberry,Atta boy Plums
Mehberry,"His defense isn't even THAT bad, he's just getting beaten again and again."
Mehberry,"Redick, stop the ice "
Mehberry,"QUICKLY JOHN, DISTRACT THEM WITH YOUR DANCE MOVES"
Mehberry,He needs to draw more contact. He's settling for those half floaters.
Mehberry,Oh for fuck's sakes.
Mehberry,OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS!!!!!
Mehberry,"Well you see:

Wittman."
Mehberry,Classic Bron
Mehberry,"None :(

EDIT: actually, might be Drew Gooden.

...

:((((("
Mehberry,Green shouts loud as fuck
Mehberry,HERE HE COMES
Mehberry,Bench Nene. I don't wanna fucking hear it. Kris Humphries not getting a minute with him playing like this is inexcusable.
Mehberry,Holy shit!!!??
Mehberry,DOC GIF NOW
Mehberry,John looks like he Frankenstein'd Blair's hand
Mehberry,"Lol Dwight's face just like ""don't look at him, don't look at him"""
Mehberry,FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
Mehberry,"Somewhat. Most train offsite. Unfortunately I'm a student trainee sort of position so the leverage is minimal. Still, scrap money is nice."
Mehberry,Ughhhhhhhhh
Mehberry,Be fucking saltier.
Mehberry,"Upcoming Beal extension + Nene on the books is gonna make free agency tough.

Plus we need to reconstruct almost all of our bench. "
Mehberry,We need every good minute Temple can give. Nice swipe Temple.
Mehberry,"We're gonna have to go full 2k from 3.

Nene is playing his worst game in a LONG time and we can't get rebounds for shit. "
Mehberry,"That weak ass Paul you suck chant. Keep it up, he'll get pumped up."
Mehberry,He's gotta be self-aware right? There's no way he can keep posting these and not realize they're ridiculously obvious.
Mehberry,Kris fucking Humphries. 
Mehberry,Delly showing some nice defense 
Mehberry,IT WAS WIDE GODDAMN OPEN. WHY. WHY. WHY.
Mehberry,Dubs playing like they just saw Krillin die
Mehberry,Can you teach Nene to Josh Smith pls
Mehberry,Clutch Wall defense 
Mehberry,YEAH JUST DON'T CALL THE FUCKING FOUL THANKS
Mehberry,I didn't expect Gortat to be annihilated. I knee we were weak at the 4 and that put Gortat at risk but he's just not doing a good job even taking that in mind.
Mehberry,...an 8 second? Haven't seen that in a WHILE
Mehberry,"Shit, I started lifting this past year in college and I still kick myself for not starting sooner. Totally could've used the health and self esteem boost at sixteen. "
Mehberry,Teams are a combined 12/34. 35%. Ugh. 
Mehberry,PI3RC3
Mehberry,Beal pls
Mehberry,Do the Wizards tag team his girl every week? What gives?
Mehberry,"Oh yeah, totally agree, it was just funny with the timing. "
Mehberry,Feel free to borrow Ramon Sessions for the night. 
Mehberry,AUSTIN RIVERS EVERYONE
Mehberry,Good lord enough static already 
Mehberry,"I see it's time for the ""I loathe Drew Gooden"" hour"
Mehberry,If that's still in his hands I'm gonna cry
Mehberry,"Unrelated but I just made a sandwich out of 6 waffles and a bunch of peanut butter and it's the best 

EDIT: [pic](http://puu.sh/hHykK/60f06a50e6.JPG)"
Mehberry,If Humphries is healthy but just being benched for Nene I'm going to be livid.
Mehberry,Shockingly enough Manu can act 
Mehberry,"Team captain of the GTown basketball team 

He wrecked that shit like Ralph"
Mehberry,"Between Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford, Doc is gonna regrow hair just to lose it. "
Mehberry,"Green got loaded by that screen, atta boy JJ"
Mehberry,Lol if we're talking bad or uncalled fouls that final score would have been 41-40. No one enjoyed the officiating that game. 
Mehberry,"We're doing fine overall, our power forwards are just dogshit "
Mehberry,Nene just shouldn't start. Small ball should start and Kris Humphries needs some goddamn minutes. 
Mehberry,"David ""the game is over when he scores"" Lee "
Mehberry,Can Mike Breen just talk over the other two the whole time
Mehberry,Sooooooft
Mehberry,"Take Gortat out, try Seraphin or Humphries or SOMETHING, playoff minutes don't mean shit when a player does bad "
Mehberry,Hedo you useless piece of shit
Mehberry,"So many chances blown and home court advantage is back with them. Ugh.

Proud of my man Bradley Beal though. Coming up big. Rough game for Otto.

And Gortat...Randy. You absolute fuck. Those plays at the end? Nice. But does that make up for not playing Humphries or Seraphin a single minute when Gortat is awful? Just like you didn't when Nene was bad? No, no it doesn't. If Humphries is in, just not being as bad as Gortat means I think we win that game. These rotations are excusable with the Wall injury but not bigs. I'm sick of it. "
Mehberry,Or when they do they're bad angles. That Beal charge didn't show the restricted area at all. KIND OF IMPORTANT.
Mehberry,Dagger.
Mehberry,"Otto got wrecked with no call, alright "
Mehberry,"Lol millsap

...oh he hurt himself. Ow."
Mehberry,"GOODBYE, SAN ANTONIO"
Mehberry,UGHHHH
Mehberry,...what
Mehberry,Nah that was like 7 steps
Mehberry,"Atta boy Wall!

Also you still suck Nene."
Mehberry,Fair
Mehberry,"What on earth was that awful music

What is this, a bungalow? "
Mehberry,How credible is this guy? I don't follow college ball enough to know good reporters.
Mehberry,"Maybe cut down some or even off reddit then, classes are important "
Mehberry,INBOUNDS TURNOVER!
Mehberry,SWAT
Mehberry,Hris Krumphries?
Mehberry,Oh that's tasty
Mehberry,Rockets aren't giving them any room 
Mehberry,THE TIME FOR BATTLE IS NOW.
Mehberry,BARN3S
Mehberry,Atta boy Barnes
Mehberry,Pile of like 5 guys lol
Mehberry,And what? Wittman adapt in less than 7 months? Impossible.
Mehberry,"If I'm the Cavs I'm begging for the Bulls offense to be midrange Pau jumpers.

Yet here we are. "
Mehberry,"Well that's going in my pile of ""fuck Manu Ginobli"" evidence."
Mehberry,"Goddamn it Seraphin, layups and hooks only."
Mehberry,See that's just unnecessary
Mehberry,*saltiness intensifies*
Mehberry,Randy the offense isn't the fucking problem when they score 37 in the first quarter. 
Mehberry,HOLY FUCKING SHIT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
Mehberry,"Davis with the ass rebound!

And Crawford with the ass shot."
Mehberry,"See, that's kind of why he pointed out the sexism."
Mehberry,I think it was that awkward fall last game 
Mehberry,"""Take cover!""

&gt;wave clearly taller than house approaches

Lol"
Mehberry,They pulled out the big guns for Jumbo Gumbo Tuesdays 
Mehberry,NENE NO TALKING THIS USUALLY ENDS POORLY 
Mehberry,Ayyyy CP is back
Mehberry,"It makes my week if I read the headline that he has been fired, so no, still on that train. 

Though the playoff wittman jokes are amusing."
Mehberry,LOL HE LET IT GO BY
Mehberry,I wouldn't be surprised. I'm not sure if it's changed but the medical personnel used by the Wizards hasn't exactly been super top notch in recent years. 
Mehberry,WOO BENEFICIAL TURNOVER
Mehberry,Damn Brooks
Mehberry,I'm almost positive these commercials are sped up.
Mehberry,"You do not try to throw shade at Paul Pierce.

You will always, always lose. "
Mehberry,This an uncomfortable conversation that I'm not even a part of
Mehberry,"You do realize most of us shit on Wale, right? We'd be more likely to join in on that trash talk. "
Mehberry,If nothing else Gortat needs rest. Come on Randy
Mehberry,"KS EARNING MINUTES

GLORIOUS DAY"
Mehberry,I can't believe it 
Mehberry,This guy's got jokes 
Mehberry,AND REDICK FREE THROWS!
Mehberry,Oh lord Spencer Hawes
Mehberry,"Nah it reset so I'm good, always got my ballstreams account as a backup "
Mehberry,"Nene is dogshit. Gooden is dogshit. But no, I wanna hear more about how it's good coaching that Kris hasn't touched the floor in the playoffs once. "
Mehberry,FUCK YOU NENE
Mehberry,"One bad thing about DC is that there's not a lot of taco bell franchises near me. 

That doubledilla looks goooood."
Mehberry,"I feel comfortable blaming Nene for the deficit so far.

Wake the fuck up, man."
Mehberry,THE RETURN
Mehberry,Alright Chris calm down
Mehberry,Gortat no
Mehberry,Not even rim? Bruh
Mehberry,"Why exactly is Smith getting minutes...at all

Much less the ball"
Mehberry,Stank
Mehberry,"""Ref you suck""

Oh good that tired ass chant again at a not awful call again"
Mehberry,OTTO!
Mehberry,"Lol JJ only half sold that and quit trying anyway, they called it afterward "
Mehberry,Thank you Gortat!
Mehberry,Hey look Nene cost us another game. Neat. Thanks Nene.
Mehberry,"You the man, Marcin"
Mehberry,Doc's voice sounds outright warped
Mehberry,"Cliiiiickbaaaaaait.

The only thing of substance in that article is saying Pierce's minutes were held back to preserve him. And that's been abundantly clear in the last stretch of the season.

Poorly written article, I can shit on Randy without clickbait just fine. Didn't see anything about ""tanking"" at all."
Mehberry,Memeface.jpg
Mehberry,I love an aggressive Beal
Mehberry,Well shit
Mehberry,"&gt;big men getting called for moving screens

Gortat gets called a lot, though."
Mehberry,Gortat please don't
Mehberry,This defense is awful. Our paint is WIDE OPEN.
Mehberry,"15 second replay, doesn't show charge.

Awful broadcast."
Mehberry,Holy shit Randy was saying to attack the rim.
Mehberry,Love you Big Panda &lt;3
Mehberry,Are you watching us play?
Mehberry,"This static is inexcusable. Someone needs at least a stern warning for this, if not a pink slip. It's ruining the experience of watching the damn game."
Mehberry,Not worth it. Nene only has another year so he's an expiring. 
Mehberry,"We have Congress, we know that bribe game well "
Mehberry,Nice backhanded compliment 
Mehberry,HARDEN ANSWERS
Mehberry,No thanks to him. Awful offensive possessions and voluntary bleeding.
Mehberry,It's not even good. It takes every precaution from making it look bad. The dude's slow mo fall looks like a models hair blowing in controlled wind. Ridiculous.
Mehberry,If you're gonna call that block a flop you show me a fucking replay. Fuck these announcers.
Mehberry,GRAB THE FUCKING BALL NENE OH MY FUCKING CHRIST
Mehberry,"Pixar could make a movie about dogshit and I'd be like ""well idk it could be neat"""
Mehberry,"I remember last time he played here the announcers had said that he'd given away some ridiculous - I mean several, several dozen - amount of tickets. "
Mehberry,Even back then he was \#PlayoffWittman
Mehberry,Yo TNT turn down the music 
Mehberry,By that logic give Mo Williams and Corey Brewer some votes 
Mehberry,There is a good reason why I was banking on Wall roasting Teague. Dennis is fast as fuck and Ramon is a piss defender. 
Mehberry,These anti smoking commercials getting  a bit overdramatic 
Mehberry,Shouldn't Otto have more shot attempts?
Mehberry,Being old and hurt did numbers in itself 
Mehberry,"Whoops.

Maintain the Woj skepticism tho."
Mehberry,Sorry bae
Mehberry,"Sweet fuck, this static is terrible "
Mehberry,Thanks Jamal for doing your job 
Mehberry,American Ninja Warrior is absolute ass compared to Japan and always will be. Ugh.  
Mehberry,Otto shut down Demar when he guarded him. Beal himself is capable. Will be interesting.
Mehberry,THE STANK FLOATER
Mehberry,"You heard it folks, Playoff Otto!"
Mehberry,Lol this graveyard of a thread 
Mehberry,Can't wait for the state farm assist stuff to stop
Mehberry,"Bruh it's the first fuckin quarter, if we get blown the fuck out in the second half sure maybe but let's at least try "
Mehberry,I'm willing to cut Temple some slack because the dude's been out for a LOOONG time.
Mehberry,"I won't be able to go to any games now due to moving back home on May 9. Might've been able to catch one of the first two Nets games.

Sadness."
Mehberry,Missed clutch free throws grey hairs like none other 
Mehberry,You can't tell me you've been watching this and thought the Hawks have earned some clout. If there wouldn't seed numbers beside the team names you'd have a hard time telling who was the top squad.
Mehberry,[\#cheeselife](http://puu.sh/hzhpw/9024a94cd1.jpg)
Mehberry,I'd understand if they were more driving oriented jumpers. A lot of it is standing still for 5 seconds and then hoisting. It's effortless and tactless. 
Mehberry,PLAYOFFS
Mehberry,Act some fuckin more Kyle
Mehberry,"As opposed to Ramon looking like a deer in the headlights for 14 seconds and hoisting another jumper? Sure. 

Believe me I'm not exactly ecstatic about choosing between Bynum and Sessions but Ramon is just being dumb right now. "
Mehberry,It's expected that there'd be posts like this but I guess it doesn't make it any less depressing 
Mehberry,Marcin Gortatuan
Mehberry,"Wow, no call there. Pierce gets his on the other end. Refs really flipped the script."
Mehberry,"If you wanna go by that definition of ""worth"", sure.

That also means Parsons was ""worth"" his contract though, so it's important to clarify. 

Would I pay him 4/40? Eh, maybe. Depends in the situation but I can justify it with his decent play and younger age. But that's where I hesitate to go higher. "
Mehberry,"Garrett ""Captain Ginyu"" Temple"
Mehberry,It bounced off Millsap again after getting Gortat.
Mehberry,Atta boy Sessions!
Mehberry,I'm pretty surprised if this series doesn't take at least 6 games. 
Mehberry,My man Bradley Beal!
Mehberry,I'm afraid I've got some bad news
Mehberry,"Will what the fuck are you

Oh okay neat"
Mehberry,"I'd gladly give a 2nd but a 1st would be a total Wizards move

Aka bad"
Mehberry,Dwight pls
Mehberry,"Not even Clippers fans had DJ at 1st all team defense. What a weird selection. 
"
Mehberry,Griffin is outright terrible right now
Mehberry,"What exactly about this thread makes you think it'd go well, OP?

At all?"
Mehberry,Really curious what his value is gonna be. Not a spectacular postseason and this won't help.
Mehberry,"Draw a fucking play. There are no excuses left. No shit jumpers.

And how about a goddamn rebound?"
Mehberry,Pierce for Drew pls
Mehberry,KSLIFE APPROACHING
Mehberry,Davis pls
Mehberry,Why even bring that up though 
Mehberry,Ehh
Mehberry,REDICK WITH THE STANK
Mehberry,AND NO FUCKING FOUL
Mehberry,Nene you are pure horseshit.
Mehberry,What goon would pick burger tho
Mehberry,Drew needs to learn how to foul hard. 
Mehberry,He's super strong so his lack of results is just odd
Mehberry,Yes
Mehberry,I feel like Pero and Korver have all the ATL fouls
Mehberry,Crawford's box score is gonna make him look so much better than he deserves. Just put Redick in.
Mehberry,He'd drive a KIA only for stealth purposes 
Mehberry,"Oh cool so we'll just take Millsap completely out and you can't complain, sounds good?"
Mehberry,Ugh bailout foul
Mehberry,I'm not even sure getting swept by Toronto would've cost him the job
Mehberry,It's a recurring issue.
Mehberry,"Nope, ESPN broadcast filled with static "
Mehberry,HYAHHHH
Mehberry,"Stop that Paul, come on"
Mehberry,JJ! FINALLY!
Mehberry,Reggie knows how to sell the foul
Mehberry,TAKE MY ANKLE BRADLEY
Mehberry,Oh calm down
Mehberry,OTTO THE GOD
Mehberry,He's right tho
Mehberry,Gortat playing sloppy. We should've had a wide open shot but he stumbled on the pick.
Mehberry,"Yep. If Wall comes back, we're getting back 1.5 players. Gortat is useless on offense without him."
Mehberry,"Nene those buckets aren't from j's, keep it close "
Mehberry,These turnovers are partially our defense but we are getting some gifts 
Mehberry,In my defense I'm relaying what the broadcast said 
Mehberry,THE BRAZILLIAN BEAST
Mehberry,Nene not even giving a single shit about that rebound. Sit your ass down man.
Mehberry,AHHHHH
Mehberry,"Fuck, yeah, that"
Mehberry,Beal and Pierce might have to carry our asses if we want this win. Lawd
Mehberry,"Might want to scale some stuff back, 3 physical activities has got to be draining"
Mehberry,NENE HAS RETURNED
Mehberry,"Bulls win first two? Bulls in 5.

Bulls split first two? Bulls in 6 OR Cavs in 7 if Bulls can't close out.

Bulls lose first two? Cavs in 6. "
Mehberry,Curry's mouthguard must be delicious 
Mehberry,"This is just painful. Clippers base their lineup so much on a distributor, without it they have 2 guys in Blake and Jamal that can realistically score on their own."
Mehberry,He's been Nene levels of bad
Mehberry,Weak ass foul tho
Mehberry,SIDESTEP
Mehberry,Whoops
Mehberry,Hey great Nene is back to ruin everything 
Mehberry,JESUS FUCK
Mehberry,Teague is getting rawdogged
Mehberry,Bynum pls
Mehberry,2K BOUNCE!
Mehberry,Nene is doing what Hibbert did last year. 
Mehberry,"...again...

:("
Mehberry,Never left the train personally.
Mehberry,It might be like the TE in football where the weird strength/speed ratio throws off defenders.
Mehberry,"Look up his announcing on the famous superbowl Tyree helmet catch.

That says it all."
Mehberry,DIBS ON GORTAT
Mehberry,The league could do with less red and blue
Mehberry,He's money on those shitty fading j's tho
Mehberry,"Nene is 0/3, no points, 2 boards in 13 minutes. 

That's fucking inexcusable in the playoffs. There's plenty of concerns right now but he's got no excuse this game. "
Mehberry,I could hear arguments for Horford over Pau*
Mehberry,Old man bucket!
Mehberry,Clips are ice cold from outside...ugh
Mehberry,Gortat is acceptable but our PF position is...needing.
Mehberry,That looks like a WNBA logo.
Mehberry,BEHIND THE FUCKIN BACK
Mehberry,...Nene.
Mehberry,"Pikkon, I think? Dude that Goku fought in the afterlife tourney "
Mehberry,WAAALL
Mehberry,gahhh
Mehberry,Nene you didn't even have to screen. He was already gonna be open. Come the fuck on. 
Mehberry,I bet the announcers have a file nearby for all the stats and a damn filing cabinet for all LeBron related stats 
Mehberry,In hindsight not trading for Jarrett Jack wasn't the worst non-move.
Mehberry,Yo having the dad of a guy that isn't even drafted yet in an ad is hella weird 
Mehberry,Our paint would be better protected with an actual bucket of paint.
Mehberry,GOT EM
Mehberry,"Someone is gonna bring a shiv and get suspended 2 games at this rate.

What does it take, a castration? Embarassing punishments from the league lately."
Mehberry,Yeah let's not call that ABHORRENT free throw lane violation 
Mehberry,DC PLAYOFFS!
Mehberry,Pierce needs more shots. He's been invisible and his defense isn't gonna lock anything down.
Mehberry,"""Defense? My specialty? Nah not the problem. We just needed to score 40 a quarter."""
Mehberry,Jordan pls
Mehberry,OTTOO
Mehberry,"PLAYOFF OTTO WAS NOT BLOCKED, HE MERELY CALCULATED THAT ASSIST"
Mehberry,"&gt;I really miss that bitch

Yeah that should tell you everything. Gotta refrain."
Mehberry,And in DC? How unheard of.
Mehberry,How's it going Goering
Mehberry,"That's a goddamn jump stop, but okay sure."
Mehberry,But was your grass greener 
Mehberry,Fuck em
Mehberry,Like...why
Mehberry,PIERCE WE NEED YOU.
Mehberry,&gt;lol why would the coach be blamed for not benching a shit player for better alternatives
Mehberry,"YES

NO

NO

Aww"
Mehberry,"THAT JOSH SMITH FACE

I'M DYIN"
Mehberry,"TT: the man, the myth, the legend "
Mehberry,They'd be mad if he even got 10. 
Mehberry,At this point I'm just assuming no screens ever are illegal 
Mehberry,Yeah that isn't gonna help
Mehberry,"This would be nothing but a choke.

RANDY. DRAW A FUCKING PLAY. NOT THIS FOURTH QUARTER BULLSHIT. NOW."
Mehberry,CarJohnomy Wallony
Mehberry,"Huh what a weird joke to make abo-

Holy shit this dude is right."
Mehberry,"OH BUT OF COURSE WE CAN REVIEW THIS

Fucking two minute rule bullshit."
Mehberry,Klay pls
Mehberry,"This is the worst broadcast of a game I've ever seen.

You have a replay for how long and can't show the fucking foul? You serious? This is completely unprofessional work."
Mehberry,"Well we could've used that goddamn information. Poor Gortat.

Poortat.

EDIT: wait...two things.

1. A very sick Gortat was arguably better than Nene. 

2. There was still no Kris Humphries. "
Mehberry,PANDA
Mehberry,KS floater! Close enough to a layup!
Mehberry,On the bright side other people are joining me on the shit on Nene train so that's cool.
Mehberry,"Let's just hope he's not seriously hurt, so let's watch the replay 30 times. 

Seriously ESPN?"
Mehberry,"Can we play some sort of hybrid zone? Beal is locking down Korver, I'm less scared of their 3's if he can't hoist them. Maybe then the paint isn't ravaged. "
Mehberry,Ramon coming out COLD this half. Yeesh.
Mehberry,Why are dubs fans shitting on us so much 
Mehberry,"I don't understand why you'd go to see a movie solely to watch a city get destroyed.

There's not even a surrounding plot. It's just ""shits on fire yo"""
Mehberry,Nene you are fucking useless. 
Mehberry,Damn good call
Mehberry,"GET BURNED, MANU."
Mehberry,Oh lord.
Mehberry,"Wait what? 

Flagrant 2 on Horford? 

WUT"
Mehberry,THE HYPE TRAIN HAS NO ROOM FOR NERVES 
Mehberry,"Nothing, just like how blabbing about the West in every single East playoff game. "
Mehberry,Head like Hey Arnold
Mehberry,"...what?

We got the dick in the first half that ATL got in the third. It's been terrible."
Mehberry,Based off his other comments it appears he's 100% serious
Mehberry,Today shall thus be declared National Fuck Atlanta Day. 
Mehberry,Not the game threads 
Mehberry,"He's like ""sweet, break in the game, time to jam"" "
Mehberry,They STILL can't fix the static 
Mehberry,LVP so far: this broadcast. The smoker voiced announcer and static is atrocious. 
Mehberry,Paul is playing Wittmanball with these shit jumpers 
Mehberry,Fuck off Lee
Mehberry,BEAL IS A BAD MAN
Mehberry,Oh please that's one of the only non moving screens of the whole postseason
Mehberry,Starting off the game with Sandstorm...bold
Mehberry,OH GOOD LORD
Mehberry,"Game of War I'm still pissed at you but that was an actual ad, so good on you."
Mehberry,OOF.
Mehberry,MARCIN GORSWAT
Mehberry,Good Jamal is back!
Mehberry,Randy reasons 
Mehberry,Doc face!
Mehberry,I FINALLY FOUND IT. [Here you are](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2xemx0/game_thread_washington_wizards_3325_philadelphia/)
Mehberry,"Apparently he got it from always eating a lot, and since DC has the panda exhibit that was the connection. "
Mehberry,NENE TO OTTOOOOOO
Mehberry,Broadcast is dogshit
Mehberry,Jordan you are a grown ass man playing this game for millions. Make the damn free throws.
Mehberry,Lol that slappy foul
Mehberry,Absolutely perfect play to go 2 for 1. 
Mehberry,DAMN IT GRAB THE BALL
Mehberry,To be fair that threshold was 1 field goal
Mehberry,"Game 7 all day. 

Never did like watching fighting stuff. Seems weird to watch grown adults fight each other for sport. "
Mehberry,The hook!
Mehberry,How dare you smite the mighty Ottoman Empire.
Mehberry,I wonder how Dion feels watching this 
Mehberry,OH GOODY WE BRIBED THE RIMS AGAIN
Mehberry,"Nah leave it on, I'll watch it with you buddy"
Mehberry,Take Sessions out. There's no excuse for these shit long twos he keeps forcing (yes that was end of quarter but it's the same shit all quarter)
Mehberry,Cool but Nene you missed a fuckin bunny 
Mehberry,"""Team without best player less good team, more at 11"""
Mehberry,"Beal, my standards are low enough to where I'd rather you just hoist bad 3's"
Mehberry,ACTUAL PLAYS
Mehberry,Putting Kyrie and Klay over Wall is goddamned laughable. 
Mehberry,Go back for more food.
Mehberry,Marco is COOKIN
Mehberry,Suck in the fart!
Mehberry,"He'd need an official exemption from the NBA, which is possible but I'm not sure how likelihoods are with that."
Mehberry,"He fucked up, but I respect Austin's hustle.

Also, fuck. Reggie's turn."
Mehberry,They'd need to follow those signings up with someone named Soul so I could make sweet rap references.
Mehberry,We can't get an offensive rebound to save our life.
Mehberry,Nah that's Ramon
Mehberry,...what?
Mehberry,So how's the 6th grade going
Mehberry,"When your team can't pass, a catch and shoot SG isn't ideal "
Mehberry,"Should've been a two. That's just some armbar swipe shit. 

Well fuck Jeff Teague, then. "
Mehberry,wut
Mehberry,HEY LOOK ANOTHER UNCALLED CHARGE
Mehberry,A bit nervous for our free throw shooting. Beal is our best but after that...ehhhh
Mehberry,Oh good Nene is still bad
Mehberry,"""He played here in Georgetown""

*shot of what is very clearly not Georgetown*"
Mehberry,It's somehow gotten WORSE over the game
Mehberry,"RIV3RS

Also lol that Doc slipup"
Mehberry,There's been legal progress cracking down on government positions which were just unpaid jobs instead of teaching kids like they were supposed to. Interns still don't have shit for workplace rights though. It's not the greatest. 
Mehberry,"Not Paul Pierce. Wall.

Jesus, this broadcast is so so bad. "
Mehberry,Well that's unnecessary
Mehberry,You think the refs just use flagrant checks as snack breaks or some shit 
Mehberry,Shut up Jackson
Mehberry,Oh good some technicals this'll go well
Mehberry,"Otto pls, really need every shot"
Mehberry,"Nene must really miss the bench.

Wake the fuck up."
Mehberry,Call fucking soft
Mehberry,"Oh good, Nene with another dogshit start."
Mehberry,"His injury killed us on defense when Dennis came in, Sessions and Bynum got roasted "
Mehberry,T Jones gives a ton of hustle 
Mehberry,If Horford hits 3's I'm approaching critical butthurt
Mehberry,"I said actually have, not say they're having. That'd be more like a 70% estimate."
Mehberry,"There is nothing I could conceivably be less threatened by as a ref than a front row seat, balding, middle aged man wearing 3 t shirts.

Lol all those rich dudes standing up yelling "
Mehberry,Assumably the refs made the decision throwing at a dart board 
Mehberry,"He's probably about average, slightly below average at this point on d"
Mehberry,NENE SMASH
Mehberry,We really needed this Nene. Awesome.
Mehberry,Even the crew can't find consensus 
Mehberry,Food can be a snack. Shit is more filling too.
Mehberry,BEAAAL
Mehberry,Rose...no
Mehberry,Beal is the baddest man on the court 
Mehberry,WALL 2FAST
Mehberry,There have been no shortage of drives without deserved calls on our part
Mehberry,WHY CAN'T WE PLAY DEFENSE
Mehberry,WHAT
Mehberry,"I'm fine with judging and player eliminations. The scoring floor is bullshit though. 

Maybe an extra round so players aren't eliminated as early?"
Mehberry,"The issue there is there strategically is that our perimeter defense and outside shooting gets tanked. For the high tempo offense we should be running, that's not good. Beal is 22 years old, it would take a pretty penny for us to move him. 

We would be more likely to move someone like Porter when his value was still high, or even Gortat with picks on top if a struggling team had a good big (a hard combo, but still). With Nene out of the picture, we'll have cap room, but we might do that via trade instead of letting his contract run, so that's another thing entirely. 

EDIT: it should also be noted that with SG being such a weak position, getting another Beal would be very, very difficult. "
Mehberry,"Kyrie and Klay being out is a considerable annoyance, Wall being out is a lottery entrance."
Mehberry,That actually might've been out on us
Mehberry,At least a dozen of those are unnecessary
Mehberry,People don't like to talk too much at funerals 
Mehberry,"Nah, Jupiter Ascending"
Mehberry,Bruh you gotta scale it back to make it convincing 
Mehberry,My salt shall not be tempered 
Mehberry,"Past 5 games, odds are gonna heavily favor Cleveland. If Bulls can capitalize on the first two games without JR and Love they'll be golden."
Mehberry,"Give John rest, dude is tired and there's another quarter."
Mehberry,"That's what you should be doing, Bynum! Atta boy!"
Mehberry,Gortat...dude.
Mehberry,Rivers pls
Mehberry,Lol chuck and the dogs 
Mehberry,"Gilbert ""the 2nd best player on the team is Antawn Jamison"" Arenas. 

I realize I'm a homer here but the man was filthy. "
Mehberry,WAIT WHAT THE FUCK HOW IS THAT NOT TIPPED
Mehberry,PAUL WITH SOME TRUTH
Mehberry,The Hawks gameplan: pass the ball to ~~Tucker~~ Korver
Mehberry,It's time for everyone to miss free throws and cause mutual panic 
Mehberry,Y u do dis
Mehberry,Blake has to kick that out. 2 open shooters. 
Mehberry,Bruh how much fucking basketball are you watching
Mehberry,Griffin has singlehandedly cost the Clippers at least 15 points this quarter alone 
Mehberry,Please don't choke please don't choke please don't choke
Mehberry,I need to get some Kirk glasses so I don't have to ball blind 
Mehberry,WALL TO OTTO
Mehberry,HOLY SHIT NO FUCKIN CALL?! REALLY?
Mehberry,I'll take it!
Mehberry,For fuck's sakes that isn't a flagrant. 
Mehberry,He plays and we win by 15. It's frustrating.
Mehberry,"Can we get some free throws, sometime, ever?"
Mehberry,"I hope you aren't suggesting that I not shit on the coach because that's happening too

That being said dogshit performances are dogshit performances, I gotchu"
Mehberry,It doesn't seem so much worse than a phone
Mehberry,I'd say to bench Jamal but you can't play JJ 44 minutes.
Mehberry,B3AL!
Mehberry,Jeez Davis looks like he's HURTING
Mehberry,Blake always takes forever to get up
Mehberry,Mozzy!
Mehberry,Might I interest you in one Nene?
Mehberry,Crawford is just AWFUL
Mehberry,Also people do generally like Jeter.
Mehberry,Hawks are really dedicated to being Spurs East. Really wanted to follow suit with the L.
Mehberry,I mean what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?
Mehberry,COME ON BRING IT HOME
Mehberry,&gt;major market team interested in free agent
Mehberry,If that Pierce shot missed I would've been livid. Wasn't even a great look.
Mehberry,FOUL THIS - DeAndre
Mehberry,Seven Nation Army? Really?
Mehberry,JJ!
Mehberry,"JOHN IS BACK

TIME TO PANIC "
Mehberry,Thank you a fucking box out call
Mehberry,Probably. With OKC signing Billy immediately I don't see any real compettition. 
Mehberry,JJ WETTICK
Mehberry,Pls gib Millsap
Mehberry,"Come on Wall, bad possession"
Mehberry,It's like they think they're battling for the MVP trophy 
Mehberry,HOTFUCKINDAMN
Mehberry,Lol holy shit they are ice cold 
Mehberry,MY MAN OTTOOOO
Mehberry,Oh hey Temple is back.
Mehberry,"I'm pretty undecided on who to root for, but it'll be good basketball at least. "
Mehberry,"&gt;they have a star, sure"
Mehberry,A t for yelling and-1? Really?
Mehberry,"Well we're gonna need Bynum to back up Sessions 

Which btw he needs to do right goddamn now"
Mehberry,This game analysis by the guys is just awful 
Mehberry,Fuckin Marco
Mehberry,Real talk Pizza Hut that's a rectangle. Give me a square or a circle. This is some geometric nonsense. 
Mehberry,"I've been writing papers on papers. In fact that's the only reason why I'm up. 

Luckily I've managed to avoid missing big games with the except of Mem-Gsw game 2. 

Hoping to keep up the hot streak. "
Mehberry,Bruh
Mehberry,If Barnes can hit shots it'll be HUGE.
Mehberry,That Horford replay showed NOTHING. ESPN dogshit production.
Mehberry,"""That's a pass to Bogut""

Riiiiight"
Mehberry,Jimmy pls
Mehberry,"I get it, but that's what sexism is, outdated prejudice. And this is sports, a traditionally ""masculine"" thing as perceived by society. It's a difference of what should be and what is, that's why it's getting pointed out, because there's gonna be a population of pissy dudes that are mad about it whenever the first female coach is hired. "
Mehberry,"I'm surprised at the no call, I thought there was some contact + shooter's embellishment, that seems like it's an instacall"
Mehberry,Barnes gonna Barnes.
Mehberry,What would make that look close? A bowling score?
Mehberry,Settle down Barnes
Mehberry,More than likely game 3 this Saturday...hopefully 
Mehberry,HOLY SHIT
Mehberry,"Chipotle is too expensive. 

I'm a man of the people and I want the people's burrito. "
Mehberry,Nene you dumb shit. Get the fuck on the bench.
Mehberry,BROADWAY BEAL WITH THE BUCKET
Mehberry,"""Are my plays out of touch?

No. It's the players who are wrong"""
Mehberry,They had one Christmas flavor I actually rather enjoyed 
Mehberry,WELL FUCK
Mehberry,"For a year yeah. David Lee isn't too much longer, might even be able to pawn him off as an expiring if you're lucky."
Mehberry,Well that only drives my point home 
Mehberry,NENE YOU FUCKING WASTE
Mehberry,RIP Otto
Mehberry,"Nene and Seraphin.

...interesting."
Mehberry,"For whatever reason it's my dad's favorite domestic, don't get it "
Mehberry,"Nene: favorite shot is from midrange, but can't make free throws.

As he puts back the brick. Lol."
Mehberry,I can't hear you past the faded flair and retired players.
Mehberry,"Just feed JJ and Blake, get JJ to switch off from Terry since he's getting hounded. Rivers and Barnes are painful from outside and Blake ISO ball is setting g yourself up for failure."
Mehberry,"My current threshold is ""not hoisting shitty j's"" "
Mehberry,"Come on John, just give the layup. "
Mehberry,"Will Bynum with the one clean move, gets called for a foul."
Mehberry,Lol TNT gave us 1 point for the jumper
Mehberry,Take advantage of this drought. This won't happen for long.
Mehberry,GOATo Porter
Mehberry,YES WE'LL TAKE ONE PAUL PIERCE PLEASE 
Mehberry,Thanks Paul!
Mehberry,"I want everyone to look at all these long two's that are happening. 

That's what Wall hides."
Mehberry,Yo that nacho thing looks delicious 
Mehberry,Cavs
Mehberry,"Out of place, just not necessarily unprofessional. Any way you can tie bio in? Or are you rethinking your major?"
Mehberry,Fucking horseshit!
Mehberry,MY MAN JOHN
Mehberry,Well that's embarassing 
Mehberry,"Redick has done a damn good job, I'm surprised "
Mehberry,This is the cross fit of treadmill ads
Mehberry,"I don't know, I think I would've heard about it."
Mehberry,Catch the fucking ball Nene.
Mehberry,Ash Ketchum effect 
Mehberry,Yeah we REALLY don't need Korver hitting.
Mehberry,GRANDMA GOODEN
Mehberry,Player flair is obtained by messaging the mods with a request.
Mehberry,Sometimes he posts dogs
Mehberry,"No one has ever cared about what you've said, Rachel Nichols "
Mehberry,"Soft ish call, but Drew needs more physical defending. He's a magnet for and-1 chances."
Mehberry,Fuck these refs. That's a goddamn charge and they've bullshitted us for almost the whole game aside from the Gortat travel and Gooden foul.
Mehberry,Butler can't settle for those kinds of shots especially with a fragmented paint protection. No j's.
Mehberry,"Part of it would depend on what kind of gameplan you would be running, I think. Jrue is an all star and young, that can't be discounted. He can defend, as you said, being [above average in defensive +/-](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/1) and he has decent scoring and facilitating skills. 

This is also, however, Jrue's 5th year in the league, and will be his 6th. I don't think it's unfair to criticize potential wasted development of Jrue by coaching staff (I've no shortage of criticisms against Monty myself) and the curiously constructed offense in which Jrue has to operate probably isn't helping either. 


Regarding youth, though, Ty Lawson is only 27 himself. His speed would hypothetically keep up for probably 3-4 more years, and even then he still has heavily underrated facilitating abilities. At his age, Ty Lawson is by most people's measure a known product. I feel given Jrue's time in the league so far and his relative statistical consistency that he's becoming a largely known product himself. If you wanted to run a moderate to slower paced offense, then absolutely keep Jrue. But if I'm going for offensive efficiency, even considering AD small ball? I absolutely do this trade. "
Mehberry,PORT3R
Mehberry,Otto pls
Mehberry,DAGGER
Mehberry,Redick what the shit
Mehberry,FUCK
Mehberry,Ehhhh I dunno there 
Mehberry,He made that but Wall needs to pick better shots. Especially so early in the shot clock.
Mehberry,Delly with the post moves 
Mehberry,Dat pixel camo
Mehberry,"Nice shot, but we're getting fucking shafted. "
Mehberry,IT'S DONE
Mehberry,That is in fact a stack of cats. 
Mehberry,\#FREEHUMPHRIES
Mehberry,"Bad call in hindsight.

Still pissed at Nene tho."
Mehberry,"No foul call, no travel call. Evens out."
Mehberry,He won't go to him WHEN Wall is back. It's absurd.
Mehberry,Paul stop that right fucking now. Those shots ruin runs. 
Mehberry,It's only this year that I've seen something I could call a consensus opinion putting him in the top 5 so I'd say the Wall&gt;Westbrook crowd is pretty minimal. Paul/Curry/Westbrook can be a bit of a wash but very rarely is anyone else in that grouping of the top 3. 
Mehberry,Uh...what
Mehberry,DREAM TEAM
Mehberry,Pierce needs to wake up NOW. We need clutch. Beal and Wall are getting hounded. 
Mehberry,We spent half that drive just not getting open for a trapped Ramon. Awful.
Mehberry,FUCK YO HACKIN
Mehberry,Klay pls no
Mehberry,"""Well alright now that the bench has kept us in it, I better bring back our dogshit starters to tank us"" - Wittman"
Mehberry,Wait hold up who are these kids with used car priced seats courtside
Mehberry,"MVP, most valuable penguin "
Mehberry,KLAY TIME
Mehberry,"I need people to watch this game with because I heated up way too many quesadillas in preparation so now I'm about to be lonely, bloated, and salty at the same time. "
Mehberry,"It's gotta be annoying trying to control momentum with timeouts when Oracle gets pumped over the most basic shit 

EDIT: damn that wasn't even an insult "
Mehberry,"You know what, fucking play KS. I'm tired of Nene's shit. "
Mehberry,FILTHY
Mehberry,"Ah yes, the Pierce."
Mehberry,"THE HOOK

Also baffled that got called on Pero and not Drew"
Mehberry,Yes yes we've established this
Mehberry,"Wittman finally deciding to take a timeout too late as the lead balloons. Again.

Sub in the fucking bench, and if Humphries still does not play a single minute, I've given up all hope of rationally understanding Wittman."
Mehberry,WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS
Mehberry,Well fuck you too.
Mehberry,Brett Favre or Maria Sharapova?
Mehberry,Ughhhhhh more military commercials 
Mehberry,BIG DICK REDICK
Mehberry,Sessions either make the layups or reset. 
Mehberry,"I'm surprised it didn't, it really should. I'm up for adding a list of banned post questions (rank the top 5 ___ , favorite/worst jerseys, favorite conspiracy theories, unpopular opinion threads, overrated/underrated threads)."
Mehberry,THANK THE LAWD
Mehberry,FUCK YOUR HOME COURT ADVANTAGE AND FUCK YOUR 1 SEED. 
Mehberry,Prepare yourselves for bonus foul shots
Mehberry,I'm not sure what the turning point was but yeah I got real bitter real fast. 
Mehberry,"""You don't want to fall back and shoot jumpers""

*swish*"
Mehberry,\#JRSmithThings
Mehberry,Temple smh
Mehberry,OTTOOOO
Mehberry,"OKAY RAMON, I SEE YOU"
Mehberry,So exactly what's a foul because apparently we aren't getting them
Mehberry,"Why they always gotta try to fuck female robots in movies

You didn't see Will Smith trying to smash everything in I, Robot but whenever the robot is female it's like well shit better make her look like some cyberpunk Jessica Rabbit shit"
Mehberry,JJ HOLD MA REDICK
Mehberry,Dennis torching Ramon with speed. I was afraid of this. 
Mehberry,These turnovers are so big for us
Mehberry,Cook em Paul 
Mehberry,Is this some sort of heinous violation of basketball code?
Mehberry,Raps could've swept and he'd still be here next season. Sadly no chance.
Mehberry,Okay Temple that's enough
Mehberry,Being the only thing we have resembling a stretch 4
Mehberry,You can't tell me that's a flop when you're watching a game with CP3 and Manu on the court.
Mehberry,B3AL
Mehberry,How about we not go full Kool Aid man into the paint and look for actual shots instead 
Mehberry,Double Agent time 
Mehberry,Randy that's why you CALL GODDAMN TIMEOUTS
Mehberry,"Yeah, but being out of position still isn't as bad as dropping the goddamn rebound as it comes into your chest and falling down like Hibbert."
Mehberry,Jesus we get it they played together
Mehberry,/r/NBA Steph source 
Mehberry,One Lopez off waivers pls
Mehberry,DJ you are a grown ass man missing free throws 
Mehberry,"Nothing official but very likely out for the series, possibly playoffs "
Mehberry,"Gortat already cleaning up boards, wish his putbacks were better attempts though "
Mehberry,AHH GODDAMN IT
Mehberry,Dat momentum call
Mehberry,If we're playing the what if game we'd like one Wall please 
Mehberry,ATTA BOY BRAD
Mehberry,They'd do this but oh please lord no
Mehberry,Why the shit is Jamal in

That is some rubberbanding nonsense. "
Mehberry,BANG
Mehberry,"Otto ""the entire 95-96 Bulls"" Porter "
Mehberry,Paul noooo
Mehberry,Bad
Mehberry,SO TIMEOUTS ARE A THING
Mehberry,"LeBron it's been 9 minutes. How are you so sweaty?

EDIT: damn that's more than I expected "
Mehberry,"It's a $100 pay per view fee, you bet your ass. My only concern is demand. Most people watch fights via streams but this is special; gonna be MASSIVE demand for HD streams which means lag a plenty. "
Mehberry,"Don't be dumb, Pierce. Come on. Smart shots."
Mehberry,Of all the calls to give us a block is not one
Mehberry,Exactly how much ball are you playing 
Mehberry,"Our lack of backcourt depth was unpleasant, I'd still take DeRozan. Bench offense was far too often lacking. "
Mehberry,That's a weird price disparity
Mehberry,Are those pennies I smell?
Mehberry,"JOSH SMITH YOU STOP THA-

oh he made it"
Mehberry,Holy balls almost
Mehberry,Jo I know you aren't playing 100% but can you seriously not get up off the damn floor?
Mehberry,My high school news broadcast didn't even have static. This is amateur hour.
Mehberry,"Know what this game could use?

Some truth."
Mehberry,QUICK AIN'T FAIR 
Mehberry,"In hindsight, could've used better guard depth. We at least tried for big men. "
Mehberry,Unless he reaggregated something he should be at least mostly healthy by now.
Mehberry,Nah he safe
Mehberry,OTTO SAYS NOTTO
Mehberry,"Gortat unfortunately can't play 48, Nene is being Nene, and Kris Humphries apparently leaked a sex tape with Randy's girl or some shit because his ass is planted to the bench."
Mehberry,Randy with the shades.
Mehberry,Wittman.
Mehberry,"I think Denver asks for more, in both those scenarios I'm preferring the Nuggets layer. NOLA likely has to add draft picks.

Lawson has great speed and facilitating skills and Chandler is a great overall player, so I'm intrigued if I'm NOLA. Straight up deal, I'll take it. "
Mehberry,Damn Marco

Hail Ottomus Prime. "
Mehberry,What's good berry fam
Mehberry,ACROBATIC PANDA!
Mehberry,Up and fucking down?
Mehberry,Ramon pls
Mehberry,"The answer is taco bell both because it's affordable and tasty, and because the only thing you can really buy is taco bell.

Unless you want to get stuffed on mcdoubles"
Mehberry,Well there you go 
Mehberry,Lol if that's all it took there'd be 20 different voice mails from 20 different GM's 
Mehberry,Diaw has that shot on lock
Mehberry,Time for Clips to step up without DJ
Mehberry,There's more chippiness in this thread than I expected. 
Mehberry,At this point I'm assuming Randy's doghouse
Mehberry,Just play Seraphin. Seriously. Nene you are garbage.
Mehberry,"It's a foul but you ain't gotta act like you just got your leg chopped off, Teague. "
Mehberry,&gt;tfw international 
Mehberry,Guys I'm pretty sure a demon is trying to possess the broadcast with this static 
Mehberry,The man is just filthy 
Mehberry,So we're actually getting calls now. Neat!
Mehberry,Oh shit
Mehberry,"We should be up two right now. So thanks Nene.

That being said: MY HEART"
Mehberry,Starters have barely rested
Mehberry,Wall and Beal getting dragged down by this trash starter performance. 
Mehberry,THOMPSON
Mehberry,Hot Jamal Crawford is a beast you cannot stop. Oh lord.
Mehberry,GET THE FUCK ON WITH IT
Mehberry,"Hey, for not having John Wall and an absolutely shit Nene, proud of the boys. Shoutout to Sessions for stepping up big. 

We still took their home court advantage, it's all good. Gonna shit on Randy in the Wiz sub though. "
Mehberry,Gooden what the fuck 
Mehberry,Thanks for nothing Nene.
Mehberry,"He'll get the use-or-lose max, most likely. He's a young guy with good talent, just needs work in some areas (most importantly defense) so somebody is gonna offer it to him"
Mehberry,Anyone seen that ex machina movie? Heard good things.
Mehberry,Just don't go for a fucking 3. Please. Just get a fucking shot.
Mehberry,Lol wtf
Mehberry,"Settle down, Dray"
Mehberry,That pizza had WAAAY too much basil
Mehberry,"""Yeah he can't hold the basketball but it's the playoffs so he's totally a pussy sitting out"""
Mehberry,"Gotta say, Redick is a goose egg offensively but he's doing work on the other end of the court."
Mehberry,I'll take the no call but...huh.
Mehberry,Bad call but busting out the ref you suck chant is some weak shit 
Mehberry,"...new?

Where have you been?"
Mehberry,No clear path wow
Mehberry,Thanks for ruining that Austin.
Mehberry,Announcers want a buzzer beater lol
Mehberry,Houston is impressing. Coming out with a dad dick against the Dubs.
Mehberry,Bonifide horseshit.
Mehberry,Good defense JJ!
Mehberry,...have you been watching?
Mehberry,"Temple is the less shitty player, sadly "
Mehberry,:D
Mehberry,"He's not even a decent defender this year, I don't know why people still see him as one. I got nothing personal against him but the fact that he's getting minutes shows our depth issue."
Mehberry,$5-6 million. Kevin Seraphin money. 
Mehberry,I SEE YOU JJ
Mehberry,NENE REMEMBERED TO BASKETBALL
Mehberry,If Klay got NBA honors over Wall twice I would've transcended saltiness 
Mehberry,"""You know criminals all got one thing in common...sooner or later they all wanna get caught""

What dumbass wrote that into a cop drama?"
Mehberry,"Not quite a dagger, but it's drawing Cavs blood."
Mehberry,"It's weird, he's normally our 2nd best defender "
Mehberry,Turkoglu has just been terrible. 
Mehberry,Refs kinda bullshitting us
Mehberry,We might wanna start trying to draw some free throws. Jumpers are low percentage and I highly doubt the refs are gonna call as many near the end.
Mehberry,Oh fuck.
Mehberry,He could be worse 
Mehberry,Oh good our offense turned to noffense
Mehberry,It looks like John borrowed one of Randy's suits 
Mehberry,Lots of shoves not getting called while the tick-tack calls are being made. Huh.
Mehberry,It wouldn't be as bad if our frontcourt wasn't useless this game.
Mehberry,Gortat wut
Mehberry,That went off Green actually 
Mehberry,"ATL doesn't even care on defense. They don't have to, they're shit right now unguarded. Ooof."
Mehberry,THE TRUUUUUTH
Mehberry,&gt;MaxOtto
Mehberry,For the commercial of the guy running away from the car in the desert...what is your best case scenario? They're gonna see and catch you.
Mehberry,DENIED
Mehberry,JJ...man
Mehberry,RIP Beal 
Mehberry,...okay I didn't say that.
Mehberry,-Rick Grimes
Mehberry,...okay Temple. Okay. I see that.
Mehberry,"Josh Smith can't just impact games, he has to be the biggest reason why the Rockets win or lose. "
Mehberry,"Just slightly above my very, very low lyrical standards for hype songs. 

Seriously it's excusably bad and the beat isn't exactly there to make up for it."
Mehberry,"Gortat, you know he can shoot. MOVE."
Mehberry,Atlanta traffic is balls
Mehberry,LeBron racking up those frequent flyer miles 
Mehberry,Temple missing foul shots is bad
Mehberry,"Deserves probably 6. He'll get 8 or so, I think. "
Mehberry,"Millsap is an all star PF that can shoot 3's and isn't a total defensive turnstile. Atlanta isn't* bidding alone on him.

Even still, I think he might get taken out of max territory. Injuries are injuries. Maybe another short deal to cash in after a year or two?  

*worst possible place to have a typo"
Mehberry,Kerr is probably preparing an absolute ass tear of a speech
Mehberry,OT is go
Mehberry,Batman symbol 
Mehberry,KS pls
Mehberry,Has my constant complaining somehow gone unnoticed? How would that even be possible?
Mehberry,Lol manu
Mehberry,"Millsap being out helps lessen the blow a not for us. 

If Nene can't do anything with him out...well let's just hope he does."
Mehberry,Lol that GRATUITOUS walk
Mehberry,I've been robbed of my Air Plums. 
Mehberry,LOL HOLY SHIT FIX THE SOUND 
Mehberry,MY MAN OTTO FUCKIN PORTER
Mehberry,"I don't think it's quite as unanimous anymore, but the KD injuries slowed that trend. We'll see next season."
Mehberry,"Nah, Orlando took that contract. 

That being said, we are in dire need of a backup 2. Hibachi pls"
Mehberry,"Already got assistants and stuff. Female referees are starting to become a thing. Perception of women slowly becoming better, or less bad, however you wanna put it. 

And yeah, that's why there hasn't been one yet. A traditionally limited demographic field is always resistant to change. But that doesn't make it any less inevitable."
Mehberry,OTTO WITH THE SAVE
Mehberry,GOOD3N
Mehberry,He'll be a top 10 pick tho
Mehberry,"Considering he hasn't even ruled out this series, possibly looking like he can potentially play this playoffs if not next series."
Mehberry,"I'd rather just try to swap Nene for Ersan Illyasova to address the stretch 4 need. I think it's a very realistic trade and the Bucks aren't clamoring to keep Ersan. Any other stretch four requires cap space we don't have and picks I'm not particularly eager for us to trade. 

 We could play Humphries at the 5 for our small bench lineup so he isn't left in a super awkward spot, and then we can address getting a better backup SG and SF/PF (will somewhat depend if Paul retires, ideally he comes off the bench at the 4). "
Mehberry,Jimmy no
Mehberry,THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT
Mehberry,After the first 3 I'd probably just prefer 6 draft picks instead. We old.
Mehberry,Harden is hitting JR Smith levels of bad jumpers 
Mehberry,How about some actual food
Mehberry,THE PANDA MUST FEED
Mehberry,BEAL NO
Mehberry,I mean I'm a little mad 
Mehberry,"Don ""the penguin"" Newman"
Mehberry,Needed that Beal
Mehberry,"Well, yes. It's not like we're unaware of this. Our PF options are weak. "
Mehberry,I've heard it's good but the pinup robot body still seems unnecessary
Mehberry,Yep. That leg is swept. Noooo mercy.
Mehberry,I wonder who actually buys the Gatorade protein bars and shakes. I checked the macros and they're fucking abhorrent calorie/sugar wise.
Mehberry,Lol Harden knocking that shit down
Mehberry,"Dude's wide open in the pain and they opt for a contested Ariza 3

Wut"
Mehberry,"""Oh look we lost all the momentum...this is perfect to have a late timeout."""
Mehberry,"I was looking forward to this game but passed the fuck out when I got home. Whoops.

Whatever, second half!"
Mehberry,"""We're just gonna continue to sit here and yell at each other""

Sums up that segment "
Mehberry,...no
Mehberry,7/10
Mehberry,PIERCE WHY
Mehberry,"Dove, would you mind explaining how, in any way whatsoever, your men's body wash makes good fathers? Because I'm lost here."
Mehberry,KS PLS
Mehberry,AHHHHHHH
Mehberry,I'll take the bucket but these refs ain't gonna call shit tonight. Wow.
Mehberry,W0t
Mehberry,The classic dime and brick.
Mehberry,"First team was pretty merited outside of DJ, so I've got no objections "
Mehberry,Yeah that pretty much entails a no. Dribbling is a bit important. 
Mehberry,"Get the rebound, come on"
Mehberry,Clown ass Atlanta crowd with the ref chants at every call against them. Give me a break. 
Mehberry,"Not once this series have we gone ""yeah small ball is good, but do we really want to take Nene off?"""
Mehberry,That motivational music 
Mehberry,Arby's gets too much hate 
Mehberry,Noah shouting like he just saw Godzilla ravaging Tokyo
Mehberry,"3 on Pero, neat!"
Mehberry,"Sort of like that with salsa.

Don't care, still delicious. "
Mehberry,"What is this, First Take?"
Mehberry,FREE CHICKEN
Mehberry,I enjoyed the bron sprite myself 
Mehberry,"&gt;artisan

&gt;McDonald's 

Really. Really?"
Mehberry,Probably why dominos dropped pizza from their name 
Mehberry,Lawd
Mehberry,Offensive rebounds! Hurrah!
Mehberry,JOHN FUCKIN WALL
Mehberry,Oh my
Mehberry,Our collapse is unacceptable but Randy just getting that happen until it's a ONE FUCKING POSSESSION GAME?! COME THE FUCK ON.
Mehberry,It'd be a strange ultimate frisbee and disc golf hybrid
Mehberry,"Nah, got the dribble in"
Mehberry,"For what it counts for, I enjoy Blue Moon. "
Mehberry,"Okay, Klay"
Mehberry,Fuck.
Mehberry,Thinking it's ours
Mehberry,"Seriously, get me a bit tipsy and 7 hours without food and it is GONE"
Mehberry,DAMN THIS MOOSE
Mehberry,If I'm the Clippers I absolutely abuse the Terry-Redick matchup
Mehberry,"I only just realized afterward Gortat was taken out.

I am fucking livid."
Mehberry,Forreal though guys need to do less mouthguard chewing 
Mehberry,Glorious foam roller 
Mehberry,Come on Ramon
Mehberry,I don't even know who Dante Jones is.
Mehberry,I got a big ass piece of cheddar cheese.
Mehberry,"Ah yes, the KSLIFE"
Mehberry,Beaaaal!
Mehberry,"This is usually the point our offense shits out, so we'll take one clutch 2006 Paul Pierce please. "
Mehberry,HARRISON GODDAMN BARNES
Mehberry,GLORIOUS GORTAT
Mehberry,SHUMP3RT
Mehberry,Sessions pls
Mehberry,"""Let's just not show the call, at fucking all"""
Mehberry,Dat southern diet
Mehberry,Carroll is too damn sneaky trying to pry boards
Mehberry,"This is DC damn it, we know our bribes "
Mehberry,Yep. Wide open paint again.
Mehberry,Just...good christ. 
Mehberry,Blame the politicians 
Mehberry,"It's a foul, but...ehhh I'm not confident enough to give Horford a flagrant "
Mehberry,It's a Priggy Party!
Mehberry,At this point I'm just waiting out the game instead of watching it
Mehberry,I'm still not totally sure what the tech was for 
Mehberry,"I don't even have a huge thing against KS. 

Though the other two are correct."
Mehberry,I'm here for the Blake point forward extravaganza
Mehberry,Surprised they didn't give Redick more free throws with how they've been calling it 
Mehberry,Hardly surprising. Especially being up 2-1 and still having home court advantage.
Mehberry,Pels say no. Too much for too little.
Mehberry,"Come on Blatt, you know it's time for the Joe Harris extravaganza"
Mehberry,For playoffs? Probably plays 41-42.
Mehberry,Brick Griffin 
Mehberry,Lol Ramon
Mehberry,Magic say no. Snell is nice but Doug hasn't prove much at all.
Mehberry,"They're kind of expensive too. If I'm paying I'd rather just get a Quest bar. 

It's a Snickers with protein. "
Mehberry,"Lol the NBA rigging it for the fucking Wizards

That'll be the day"
Mehberry,Producers gotta realize kids singing isn't automatically creepy. Either do it right or you just look tacky.
Mehberry,Clippers beg for Parker to take that all night.
Mehberry,FUCK YOU TEAGUE
Mehberry,My man John with the floater 
Mehberry,"Nene is terrible again. And Seraphin/Gooden are getting playing time over Humphries. 

Even KS.

I might collapse by halftime."
Mehberry,Pls convert 2nd chance points 
Mehberry,Drew Gooden you useless knob. 
Mehberry,"Sideline reporter still on the bike lol

No game to watch"
Mehberry,Well on the bright side I don't have to stay up late to watch games if they're super blowouts so thanks Cavs I guess 
Mehberry,"So Nene how about you not be the reason we're down, how about that?"
Mehberry,MARK IT UP EVERYONE
Mehberry,"Free throws

Please

*Please*"
Mehberry,At the time it seemed amusing
Mehberry,"Can confirm, am feeling emotional pain"
Mehberry,MOTHERFUCKIN OTTO
Mehberry,How about some free throws? No? Oh okay.
Mehberry,So many announcer jinxes on Harden's free throws 
Mehberry,I'd say tagged but you're gonna need some nice flexibility there 
Mehberry,Chris Paul is a man possessed.
Mehberry,Paul has 4 lungs and Blake is getting more rest 
Mehberry,"Oh look, Kyrie over Wall again, what a fucking shock.

EDIT: and Klay? What was this, a 2k poll?"
Mehberry,All fucking ready?
Mehberry,That's a huge part of their offense to be fair 
Mehberry,ALL THESE BUCKETS
Mehberry,"No fucking travel call. Yeah okay.

Garbage."
Mehberry,OH GOOD GOD
Mehberry,"Delly is out there for crunch minutes.

Cavs might need a better bench. "
Mehberry,I'd say that was a pleasant surprise to most Wiz fans
Mehberry,These rolls are golden 
Mehberry,Drew-rew sounds like an anime character lol
Mehberry,CAN'T STOP HIM
Mehberry,That's three plays now where redick is wide open but the Clips fuck up instead 
Mehberry,"No.

EDIT: guess this didn't come across as tongue in cheek as I'd intended "
Mehberry,"Bout to cast some lightning spells on these birds. 

FRIED HAWK, COMIN UP!"
Mehberry,Well if Barnes is hot then that's an issue
Mehberry,OH HOLY SHIT
Mehberry,Dimes to Otto all day
Mehberry,What nonsense just occurred?
Mehberry,What's the point of a 9 pm start time if it's not the actual start time?
Mehberry,My patience with Nene is already very thin. This isn't helping.
Mehberry,OH SHIT ESCALATION
Mehberry,Combination of sloppy play and Warriors d so far. Memphis gotta step up. 
Mehberry,GE what the fuck
Mehberry,Hey ball movement for a Pi3rc3!
Mehberry,Jamal da gawd
Mehberry,Shit I got work early but this is good
Mehberry,"Never did like Dunleavy. That's bound to happen when you pull that bullshit. 

MCW fell for the vet bait. "
Mehberry,Gortat is the last guy we can afford to be bad. 
Mehberry,Gets them at Supor K-Mort
Mehberry,Rivers is WET
Mehberry,My neighbors must be really concerned by the sounds I'm making 
Mehberry,Hey Ramon how about some more long fucking twos?
Mehberry,Atta boy Jordan!
Mehberry,OOOOO DAMN
Mehberry,It's almost impressive how fast this thread got mean
Mehberry,Beal what the fuck
Mehberry,"If you tried to start Andy you'd get 40 games. Forced to start Mozgov just from injuries alone.

Plus, even healthy, Andy is old. Off the bench is the best for him."
Mehberry,Damn I wish I had that much cheese. 
Mehberry,"""I'm sure Nene won't shit the bed again and cost us the game, so this feels safe to make"" - Paul Pierce "
Mehberry,Uhhh
Mehberry,RANDY CHANNEL ALL OF YOUR DEFENSIVE POWERS RIGHT NOW
Mehberry,Well that's embarrassing 
Mehberry,Pierce not handling the ball well. Needs to just catch and shoot. 
Mehberry,For fuck's sakes.
Mehberry,Well damn
Mehberry,That shot release time is cheese.
Mehberry,Houston is damn stubborn right now
Mehberry,"Nene elbow and the travel.

We still should've gotten the ball with 3 seconds left though."
Mehberry,How the fuck was that anything?
Mehberry,Beverley being hurt makes this matchup pretty much the worst 
Mehberry,That was the ugliest basket
Mehberry,"Oh sweet jesus no. 

Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness the strongest case of John Wall being the most valuable player to his team than any other player in the NBA. "
Mehberry,EXCELLENT QUESTION
Mehberry,WITTMAN CALL THE FUCKING TIMEOUT BEFORE IT'S ONE POSSESSION 
Mehberry,Teague annoying me with the acting. Just take the foul bruh.
Mehberry,"Hawks fans have been blaming every single thing but our good play, don't act like it's a persecution complex "
Mehberry,The ultimate Harrison Barnes hater
Mehberry,"Teague seriously trying to convince Joey that's a flagrant?

My fucking sides."
Mehberry,Love all these trips to the line. If Temple can make his damn shots we'll be even more golden.
Mehberry,JJ played great defense but had arguably his worst offensive game of his Clipper career as well. Play pretty much sums up the game for him.
Mehberry,"Luckily they've been great so far, Gooden even playing good defense. "
Mehberry,"Houston's balls just got BUSTED. Losing at home? To the Clippers without fucking Chris Paul?

No momentum whatsoever now. Even if they split that's still incredibly embarassing."
Mehberry,Or Doug Collins...ugh
Mehberry,"TANKATHON 2015

EDIT: for everyone's reading pleasure - http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2xemx0/game_thread_washington_wizards_3325_philadelphia/"
Mehberry,That's some lowwwww hanging fruit right there.
Mehberry,Wall at least choose the 3
Mehberry,I'm not even sure what we do to adjust. Our bigs are getting ROASTED and I'm not sure how we cover that up.
Mehberry,I've got my complaints about calls but they're gonna have 65 at the half. and we're supposed to be a defensive team. Run small ball to bench Nene and Bynum's defense is just too bad. Play him to rest Ramon and little more. 
Mehberry,Temple hit the free throws! Come on!
Mehberry,Right decision. A game or even a series isn't worth fucking up the whole franchise with a worsened injury. 
Mehberry,...where?
Mehberry,3'S ON 3'S!
Mehberry,"Fuck em over, DJ!"
Mehberry,"How the fuck are you gonna call a foul

Up, jersey grab, never mind "
Mehberry,Shit let him try tonight 
Mehberry,DISRESPECT
Mehberry,WE NEED ALL FREE THROWS
Mehberry,Shump getting the ball like he's LeBron for some reason 
Mehberry,Wow they aren't gonna call any fouls tonight then 
Mehberry,"""Chris you need to pass more"" - things I'm surprised to be saying "
Mehberry,Who would actually buy Corona for Cinco de Mayo? It's Mexican piss. It's like thinking Guinness is Irish. 
Mehberry,Nene landed on his leg...ow
Mehberry,Yep regular Kurt is back
Mehberry,Well this is sloppy 
Mehberry,I see you Matt
Mehberry,"OH NO OPEN KORVER


...oh. Yay!"
Mehberry,He is at best a 6 and that's if he shaved off that awful goatee. 
Mehberry,Tru
Mehberry,So can we fuckin play him now?
Mehberry,Pierce we really need you to hit those.
Mehberry,OTTO TRANSITION SLAM
Mehberry,:(
Mehberry,"Beal needs to shoot more.

I know I'm gonna complain about it later but he needs to be our \#1 tonight."
Mehberry,"I'm seriously for playing a completely cold Humphries over them, their play is inexcusable, especially Nene"
Mehberry,Lol JVG has no time for your happy fantasies. 
Mehberry,OH SWEET FUCK NO
Mehberry,Clippers balls are just broken 
Mehberry,BIG MAN
Mehberry,Well it's a 3 but come on Beal
Mehberry,All attention should be re-diverted to Anthony Bennett. 
Mehberry,Beal be like KOBE
Mehberry,Oh the Clips do NOT need that
Mehberry,Pierce what the fuck. No.
Mehberry,"Control the Atlanta frontcourt. 

We're going to be running at most a 9 man rotation, more than likely. Atlanta has a deeper bench and Millsap can feast on whoever plays the 4. Pierce is top small and slow, Nene is way too slow. If he does that, Horford has a lot more chances to feast in the paint as well and Gortat can only do so much. 

If the frontcourt is on fire, then the good perimeter defense we'll have set up (Wall/Beal/Porter) has an even harder job to do. Atlanta gets point from their ball movement, and Millsap is arguably their best shot creator - make sure he's limited, and the overall offense will follow suit. Will also have to do the same for Horford but Gortat is a decent matchup for him, so that'll be interesting.

Offensively, Wall and Beal have to step up huge. Wall can roast Teague, which we will need - just look what Deron Williams did last series when he was hot - but Carroll is gonna be a pain in the ass for Beal. Playoff Pierce and a nice contribution from Otto are also necessary. 

As for Nene and Gortat, I'm not ecstatic. Nene is probably going to have to bruise his way into his points if he wants them, Millsap has mobility. We should be feeding Gortat with the P&amp;R and transition passes as much as possible, we'll be out of there fast if we try to pull what Memphis does. 

As for their bench...ugh. Hope for the best. We don't really have one to use. Kris Humphries playing will be huge for rebounding and stretching the floor with his jumpers - which I suspect the Atlanta defense would gladly opt to give him - but players like Sessions and Seraphin are much less consistent. We'll need them tl show up (especially Ramon Sessions, who has a capable guard to go against in Dennis). "
Mehberry,Lol Shaq got scurred
Mehberry,I was nothing short of astounded. I was not expecting him to ball out at all. 
Mehberry,If they play him they better have a HARD minutes cap. No reason to play him unless it's just to field test him post-injury. 
Mehberry,Atta boy Sesh
Mehberry,How the fuck has Griffin not shot free throws yet 
Mehberry,Grandma Gooden!
Mehberry,OH SHIT
Mehberry,So...should we try Seraphin? Gortat is ass.
Mehberry,"""Hmm, I should bench Nene until he improves"" 

\#NotRandyThings"
Mehberry,Jerseys fresh as hell
Mehberry,MY MAN BRADLEY BEAL!
Mehberry,"Could've worded better, but it's calling us a shitty team while saying it's Atlanta's fault for losing. Calls us bad and doesn't give us any credit. 

Compliment was just the first word I associated with backhanded."
Mehberry,"LAC about to start the break, finally the whistle for Harden

(Not a bad call but fuck late calls are shit)"
Mehberry,Say nice things about Wall and we'll get you covered 
Mehberry,WALL TO BEAL DC3
Mehberry,Veeeery different kinds of eats though 
Mehberry,...my heart.
Mehberry,Fuck off.
Mehberry,JJ GODDAMN REDICK
Mehberry,Oh no. Whatever will GM's do.
Mehberry,I'm so fucking tired of Nene.
Mehberry,"Oh no, Davis "
Mehberry,My unclutch DirecTV box having to reset itself right before the game
Mehberry,Uh oh
Mehberry,BNYUM PLS HIT THESE
Mehberry,I just wish that Klay would shave that freshman year of high school / sketchy bowling alley employee goatee. 
Mehberry,I'm very glad to be wrong tonight 
Mehberry,"That'd be a little fucky to even joke about, if they were serious then that's some major fuckery.

You can't run away from him, Dennis. He's too fast. Should've picked a beef with Steve Novak if you wanted to take that route. "
Mehberry,Lol that was out on Curry
Mehberry,Jones pls
Mehberry,He's rolling the dice in the same way that 2:1 odds and 10:1 odds are both gambling. 
Mehberry,Beal with the long two smh
Mehberry,Goddamn it Jamal.
Mehberry,YES!
Mehberry,Well that's a dumb question 
Mehberry,"If Beal hoists 20+ attempts, so be it. I want to see more 3's is all."

Mehberry,"Good start, Ramon."
Mehberry,How tragic
Mehberry,We somehow lost this in the most DC sports way possible.
Mehberry,BASED BYNUM
Mehberry,"No Wall, shit coach playing shit Nene, and some questionable calls and noncalls? 

I'm okay with this. "
Mehberry,"HE AIN'T EVEN STRETCH DOE

DOOOOOEEEEEE"
Mehberry,Mozgov needs to stop settling for jumpers 
Mehberry,I think Nene is one of our few guys that's healthy actually 
Mehberry,I'd love to hear some more reasons about why we are the the one thing that isn't causing the Hawks to play poorly.
Mehberry,Except most rebounds. Then he takes a nap.
Mehberry,Gortat is getting eaten alive. Ugh. 
Mehberry,"The refs making me root for the Rockets

NBA what have you done"
Mehberry,"""Oh look the Wiz score. Neat.

AND IT'S KORVER FROM THREEEEEE"""
Mehberry,OH DAMN
Mehberry,Job lined up?
Mehberry,We need more medical staff!
Mehberry,Oh shit Beal got kicked.
Mehberry,"Oh yeah I'm surprised there wasn't a call, but it's not as if they can just go back and say there was a foul, can reverse the possession "
Mehberry,Alright it's official I've got no fucking clue what's gonna be a foul or not down the stretch 
Mehberry,Jamal what the fuck.
Mehberry,Idk I think people are just trolling playoff threads
Mehberry,These announcers craving another buzzer beater
Mehberry,That's a goddamn charge!
Mehberry,It really is kind of creepy though
Mehberry,Atta boy Gortat 
Mehberry,"This...stings. So much.

Nene...just leave."
Mehberry,Idk I feel like Kobe would shit hard on LAL when they goofed 
Mehberry,Delly dragging the team to a lead lol
Mehberry,"Offensive foul on Howard?

Lol what is this momentum based officiating "
Mehberry,Except he's not even worth 12 million. 
Mehberry,He's had a rough night 
Mehberry,"Ah...hmm. Fuck.

Wall, Beal, Otto obviously. Kris Humphries.  Uh...hmm.

Do we *have* to protect 9?"
Mehberry,"That Jurassic World ad still annoys me.

*""We're talking about an animal here!""*

Mehberry,"You can't tell me these are the best angles, come the fuck on ESPN"
Mehberry,"We need stops. We do not have stop players in right now.

Oh lawd."
Mehberry,"Refs tossing shade at us, jelly of our rim powers "
Mehberry,Lol Gooden catching the shot 
Mehberry,"All things considered... 7 points and a completely shut down Korver? 

With Wall out?

Sure!"
Mehberry,How credible is Lawrence?
Mehberry,Atta boy JJ 
Mehberry,Grandma Gooden 
Mehberry,"Nothing for Beal, but Otto gets called?

Yeah alright."
Mehberry,Paul is in playoff mode
Mehberry,Bulls need better shots. Some are going in but if I'm Cavs you let them go up.
Mehberry,"Lol I'm getting buried instantly, the playoff crankiness is real"
Mehberry,WET
Mehberry,"One at a time guys, one at a time"
Mehberry,"For whatever reason, even as someone who prefers basketball, defensive football is just so much more appealing to me. In fairness, I am a Ravens fan, so there is that, but still. 

EDIT: also, I think defensive basketball is still generally less appealing than football just to compare. There aren't that many steals and blocks, usually. It's a fast paced brickfest if you're playing proper defense and it does usually look ugly. It's slow for fans of the defensive team and just outright frustrating for other observers wanting good offense. 
"
Mehberry,NBA's Wayne Brady
Mehberry,The calls aren't terrible but you gotta be quicker making them 
Mehberry,"With how this is going so far? Completely believable.

I hope they piss off Pierce. "
Mehberry,T Jones coming off the bench big
Mehberry,Nene is good again
Mehberry,"He's just old fashioned, nothing to see here "
Mehberry,Oh for fuck's sakes 
Mehberry,Not Gooden or Nene tho
Mehberry,"He's been a defensive matador, unfortunately "
Mehberry,"Anyone on our team without John Wall, except Beal sometimes.

Pierce was maddening. Hero ball jumpers all the day. He was clutch but he shot like there was 2 seconds left in the fourth except it'd be halfway through the 2nd quarter. 

Gortat needs Wall to get good looking buckets.

Nene makes me sad."
Mehberry,Tristan got dem Magic handles 
Mehberry,Doc talkin SHIT
Mehberry,TT with his 44th rebound 
Mehberry,"Bynum that's how you continue to not get minutes. Come on, shoot the ball there."
Mehberry,"JJ played on average, what, 42-43 a game? His cardio is great but I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was a factor in his slumping offense. Ridiculous. "
Mehberry,Otto 2stronk
Mehberry,Reggie needs to chill a little 
Mehberry,At least he's giving some buckets but defensive Nene has been underwhelming this half. 
Mehberry,Wut 
Mehberry,"Pierce, bruh"
Mehberry,Let me tell you I am very glad to not be a hockey fan tonight. 
Mehberry,"I realize how much we're complaining, but how does Humphries feel watching Nene play like such dogshit, yet still he gets no time?"
Mehberry,"It's the fourth quarter so I know it's not gonna happen but I'd actually compliment Randy if he just played Humphries instead of the garbage pile Nene is right now. 

Gortat is our only big right now."
Mehberry,Oh good god no. 
Mehberry,Blake got moves 
Mehberry,Fuckin Barnes.
Mehberry,"Finally, Crawford"
Mehberry,NEEDED THAT PIERCE
Mehberry,He's setting the record for holding L's
Mehberry,OPTIMUS DIME HAS DEFENSE TOO!
Mehberry,"Not that you don't have some merit there, but the Hawks got taken to 6. Sloppiness was hardly exclusive. "
Mehberry,Pero casually hugging Nene for no call
Mehberry,Otto you gotta make foul shots
Mehberry,"...Seraphin and Gortat?

What the fuck?"
Mehberry,I'd like everyone that seriously spouted Playoff Wittman praise to take a serious look at this game and series' rotations and affirm your confidence in this coach.
Mehberry,"That was Horford's first bucket?

Oh my."
Mehberry,Flagrant one: told somewhat mean spirited joke
Mehberry,I'm ecstatic to see them kicked out. That series was painful.
Mehberry,Someone raise the 3 point sliders 
Mehberry,"Sweet summer child, you have seen nothing."
Mehberry,For the second one they should 
Mehberry,I SEE YOU DWIGHT
Mehberry,Nate cold
Mehberry,"He doesn't get more than half a second to shoot, he rushes because they close so fast on him"
Mehberry,FUCK YEAH
Mehberry,OH GODDAMN IT NO
Mehberry,Is around 25% not shutdown defense?
Mehberry,That was a scramble
Mehberry,I assure you we would've crowdfunded a ref bribing effort if we could 
Mehberry,"Gasol was a human stepladder, gotta call that over the back."
Mehberry,If Drew has the ball for more than a second it's a bad shot every time. Every single time.
Mehberry,Seraphin is our best big man this game. Take that for what you will.
Mehberry,Hedo you are quite bad. 
Mehberry,"He's gonna get burnt no matter what, Korver would annihilate us"
Mehberry,"Oh shit, Stein is the source. Well this is damn near a confirmation then. "
Mehberry,Dray just came 4 times 
Mehberry,I still feel the Tayshaun Prince comparisons are the most apt 
Mehberry,"I'd guess he makes at least 7 figures, he's one of the most known cable sports guys."
Mehberry,Is Redick too tired for defense or something? He's getting burned.
Mehberry,"""Oh he's getting hacked? Nah fuck that, turnover."""
Mehberry,Part of me is surprised Josh Smith is still allowed to shoot 
Mehberry,BEEEEAL
Mehberry,"At this point, it's just ""not the Cavs.""

In order, Hawks/Warriors (toss up), Rockets, Cavs. "
Mehberry,27 points...that's some seriously quick escalation
Mehberry,REBOUND THE FUCKING BALL
Mehberry,"KILL EM, AUSTIN"
Mehberry,Holy shit we have a top 3 draft pick? Really? Well shit let's try giving him minutes.
Mehberry,"Ah yes, Larry ""we made an amazing non-move not to sign him again for once"" Hughes "
Mehberry,Cavs settle a bizarre amount offensively. It's Wittmanball.
Mehberry,"So what's it like being the Seattle Seahawks of the NBA, except without a championship in modern history "
Mehberry,That Nets bucket sounded like crumped foil. What's with the ESPN broadcast?
Mehberry,Well shit what did we do? 
Mehberry,No our coach is just dumb.
Mehberry,The fuck is this casino commercial 
Mehberry,2 min left. Leave Gooden in.
Mehberry,FRENCH KAREEM
Mehberry,This would be so much worse if he wasnt going Ottomatic
Mehberry,Do you put Jordan back in? These rebounds are painful.
Mehberry,Boooo
Mehberry,Real deal Beal showed up. Major props to the kid. 
Mehberry,Well that'll do it
Mehberry,Finally 
Mehberry,Blake is tanking the Clips right out of the timeout 
Mehberry,Flagrant fucking 2. Get the fuck out of here with that shit Teague. 
Mehberry,"Please be okay.

Fuck, if Wall is out we get swept no contest. "
Mehberry,"We probably run our small ball lineup of Wall-Beal-Porter-Pierce-Gortat there. Nene being out there against small ball might not go so well unless he's the hot hand, so I'd prefer to match the small ball.

Our use of Porter, Pierce, and Nene is gonna be very interesting."
Mehberry,Get that boy some protein!
Mehberry,"DC, law and bureaucratic related work. I'm not worried about a career job since I'm going into undergrad senior year and applying to law school, but considering I'll be taking the first year of law school off outright, would prefer a bolstered résumé."
Mehberry,I realize putting in a bench player cold to replace Gortat isn't necessarily feasible. Maybe if Randy hadn't been a total fuckhead again and maybe played Seraphin or Humphries when our starting center is losing us the game we'd HAVE THAT OPTION. 
Mehberry,"Nene half asses whatever he doesn't do though. Defense = no boards, and vice versa."
Mehberry,Just...why? You have easily the worst of any team's. I don't understand.
Mehberry,"Taj going for that highlight NFL catch, just rebound it bruh"
Mehberry,"Redick has one attempt. Barnes has what, 5? This is ridiculous. "
Mehberry,"5 on Al, beautiful."
Mehberry,"Psssssst

Might want to guard Dunleavy"
Mehberry,Aren't you just exemplary
Mehberry,Compared to game 3 this deserves awards
Mehberry,"""Ice this 3, DeAndre"""
Mehberry,ARE THOSE BUCKETS I SEE?
Mehberry,Jamal you piece of horseshit.
Mehberry,Our bigs are digging our grave.
Mehberry,"Playing transition d against the Clippers must be testicles.

Every time you're just thinking ""I really hope I don't get alley-oop postered."""
Mehberry,"Seriously, with all the shit we put up with tonight? I'm okay with this. Much better than I expected."
Mehberry,"Your analysis isn't totally off, but you haven't seen enough of Beal to think he's a primary ballhandler. He's nothing close to what Harden was/is. Beal is superior in the off ball role. "
Mehberry,"It's the 2nd damn round, not a weekday Sixers matchup. 

We get no credit."
Mehberry,"HEY THANKS GOODEN FOR DOING NOTHING

AGAIN"
Mehberry,"Even if Millsap does have 15 points, making him take 14 shots to get it isn't awful. "
Mehberry,Lol Steve
Mehberry,"Yep, that's the one! I liked it."
Mehberry,Reggie gets Lou Gehrig'd
Mehberry,"I'm saving my rants and such, I've issued plenty all year. I'll wait for a proper time. Plus I still moan a ton during game theeads anyway. "
Mehberry,I've never seen the Insidious movies but I very much doubt they've warranted a third movie 
Mehberry,A Milli
Mehberry,Shout out to Pippen for representing on the road 
Mehberry,"Thanks Paul, needed that bad"
Mehberry,Good defense + length is magnificent 
Mehberry,"&gt;Woj article

&gt;PBT

Not a chance. "
Mehberry,Hawes flash is nice but maybe not to the shin
Mehberry,Gotta see if Jamal is still shit
Mehberry,Millsap is out with 5. ATTACK THE RIM!
Mehberry,WEEEEEEEEEELL SHIT.
Mehberry,"Beal, please. We need everything we can get."
Mehberry,...Enrique?
Mehberry,"Right in Redick's face, too. Yeesh."
Mehberry,"Maybe try doing more studying by hand without tech, just print things out and work alone maybe "
Mehberry,"Plus all the tweaks. LeBron is a bit hampered, Noah needs help bad, Beal isn't playing full health, etc. Lots of injuries."
Mehberry,It's getting really frustrating when we'd be a playoff bubble team in the East without Wall and he still gets snubbed. His crippled ass carries a terrible late season wizards squad and he still gets snubbed for it. Ridiculous. 
Mehberry,GODDAMN IT REBOUNDS
Mehberry,Supposedly wanting a stronger call (flagrant) on Beal
Mehberry,"At this point they're arguably the strongest candidate given the health of Memphis. 

Though the Davis injury might be an inconvenience."
Mehberry,Missed free throws hurt the soul.
Mehberry,So...playing Humphries as a small 5? Thoughts?
Mehberry,You know not what you do McHale.
Mehberry,PIERCE!
Mehberry,My perception of NOLA is based entirely off the Hannibal Buress skit 
Mehberry,"In DC most of the guys are on bikes, that pizza would be some shit"
Mehberry,CP THE GOD
Mehberry,HIBACHI
Mehberry,Well this is bad
Mehberry,Nene...why? Why even do that? 
Mehberry,Lol Blake stop that
Mehberry,I SEE YOU BLAKE
Mehberry,If Randy talks about not getting enough good looks I'm going to collapse.
Mehberry,"Yo that ref kick ball leg was high 

Ref got his Rockettes impression on"
Mehberry,"John Wall is probably one of the best defensive point guards in the league, that's huge against Teague "
Mehberry,Oh god that nightmare smile
Mehberry,Also you don't have to stay up until 5 am to watch!
Mehberry,Kris goddamn Humphries!
Mehberry,Chris Paul just distributed his balls all over Dwight with that. Goddamn.
Mehberry,Bogut is HUNGRY
Mehberry,"When the 1 seed barely shows up, of course I'm gonna talk shit. "
Mehberry,"Can confirm, am Ravens fan. 

Ferry is smart, so don't worry too much. But it's probably not gonna be the funnest."
Mehberry,Okay Mozzy
Mehberry,When it's backcourt you pretty much gotta have an A+ case for charges 
Mehberry,"If Nene keeps playing like he is for the rest of the playoffs you're gonna see a LOT of trade ideas floating around in the offseason. 

Come the fuck on man."
Mehberry,BIG MAN JORDAN
Mehberry,I feel as if there's pretty solid odds supporting that assumption but alright 
Mehberry,"I am Ron Swansoning the hell out of my job right now. I have done almost nothing all day and gotten paid for it.

Only 3 more hours until ~~basketball~~ working on final papers :("
Mehberry,"Great run to end the half, Wall is a man possessed. LET'S GO!"
Mehberry,For the giggles. Which I'd say is working. Look at all the vote related comments. 
Mehberry,"Are the Cavs playing shitty zone or what, Bulls are just free range from outside "
Mehberry,BOGUT
Mehberry,LeBron sounds like he's recorded through a bad CB radio
Mehberry,Stay safe Wall. 
Mehberry,...that was only the THIRD largest win in playoff history?
Mehberry,"Still in his hands.

What a fucking DC way to go out."
Mehberry,"Damn, Kyrie"
Mehberry,DELLY
Mehberry,Bulls convince themselves they're a 3 point shooting team like this sometimes. Grinds down the offense if there isn't a hot streak. 
Mehberry,WALL TO GORTAT HAS RETURNED
Mehberry,REJECTED
Mehberry,We've got a lot of issues but Gortat is the biggest factor behind us being behind. Awful. 
Rswany,"Honestly, all things considered.

Cavs only down 2 isn't pretty damn good considering how shit they've played."
Rswany,I lolled
Rswany,"Wiggins commercials are all on Canadian TV.


That sounds like a joke but I've watched TSN streams and almost every commercial break has Wiggins."
Rswany,"Love's defensive deficiency is vastly exaggerated.

Yeah, TT is better on defense but Love's shooting and rebounding more than make up for it.


It's crazy people are having this discussion."
Rswany,"If either of those team would have continued playing at that level they would have had a pretty damn good chance at the WCF and then The Finals.

The Clippers just happened to run out of gas."
Rswany,T THOMPSON DAH GAWD!
Rswany,"&gt;a bush baby.

Wot
"
Rswany,http://gfycat.com/PeacefulBlandGemsbuck
Rswany,"Yes, he's shown [he can stay with the best offensive players in the league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJnarXYrFSs)

Aside from a few and far between rookie lapses he played incredibly solid defense against opposing team's best player.


If you actually watched his games I don't see how you could possibly say he didn't.

"
Rswany,"He tore a ligament when he played for us last year and got cut.


"
Rswany,"Lol, wtf, I just watched Bloodsport like a month ago and that part wasnt in it."
Rswany,embrace them
Rswany,"This commentary has consisted of ""DAE JASON TERRY OLD?"" so far.."
Rswany,He's shy
Rswany,"&gt;If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player **who has established a legal position**, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. 


He has to be established and set for it to be called (unless the call is for an elbow/lowered shoulder/etc)"
Rswany,"&gt; Actually there definitely is something scientifically valid when calling someone ""injury prone."" Often times, it comes down to an individual's physical and biological makeup: bone structure, how their muscles and joints are ""wired"", and other natural factors inside the body. Being injury prone can also be attributed to things such as how quick your growth spurt was as a child, and how your body adjusted along the way to said growth spurt.
&gt; Since we are talking about professional athletes here - specifically NBA players - the way an individual's body has responded to growth over the years is a huge factor. Certainly, the nature of injuries is preceded by some amount of dumb luck and wrong plant-foot/wrong place type of scenario - however certain guys are most definitely more ""injury prone"" than others.

I'm calling bullshit aside from general things like taller/bigger guys will be more prone to knee and foot problems because they are under more stress.

But if you take two guys of the same height and weight you're gonna tell me one's more injury prone purely because his skin is a little bit different than the other.


&gt;Injuries compound themselves over time as you tend to favor one part of your body, over-compensating for an injury. So through just for the simple fact of having been injured a bunch of times before, a guy is statistically more likely to be injured through physical activity.


This is well known but it's not really genetic.  That's why some players never return to their former selves after an injury."
Rswany,"Scola is well known for using subtle cheap shots to bait other teams players into retaliating.

Im not saying Love's cheapshot wasnt dirty or worthy of punishment.  Just that Scola is a dirty asshole as well.

Once again, that is *incredibly* different than rape and victim blaming and Im still a bit worried you would continue to make that comparison."
Rswany,"These youngbloods gotta know, this game has been and always will be about buckets, not buttons."
Rswany,"I think Flip fully intended to only coach for a year or so until he found a good replacement but now he's all drunk on the young talent and stuff to walk away.

He's in too deep."
Rswany,"&gt;middle school me.

It's okay bruh, you don't need to pretend it's still not fucking terrifying."
Rswany,"The true and tried ""every body just jog around a bit"" inbounds play.


Modern classic."
Rswany,"Lol, the ""CRAW-FORD"" chants remind me of Wild vs Blackhawk games."
Rswany,You're not wrong about the injuries but I dont think Warriors fans like your sass.
Rswany,It's much funner to pity them because it stings them more than the hate (which they're accustomed to).
Rswany,"He owns a different team in the same conference, so no."
Rswany,"Thank god for this thread, I had a bunch of margarita mix leftover from Cinco de Mayo and wasn't sure [where I'd get my salt from](http://gfycat.com/PeacefulBlandGemsbuck)"
Rswany,"CP3 reaches in... clean strip.


TP reaches in..  FOUL!"
Rswany,"Damn, Horford wound up and everything."
Rswany,"Yeah, cause if it was some guy who told him to calm down the top comment would also be ""OMG what a BITCH!"""
Rswany,"No he wasnt.

Did you even watch a single game?

Wiggins played solid defense but he also happened to play alongside rookies and D-leaguers like LaVine, Payne and Justin Hamilton (statistically the worst C in the game).



Because of it Wiggins' advanced defense stats are fucked.
"
Rswany,"Chris Paul extended his entire arm on the stiff-arm on Green...


"
Rswany,Good game
Rswany,As they should.
Rswany,"Did you guys even watch the Spurs - Clippers series?


Both teams were playing at an incredibly high level.

The Clippers were firing on all cylinders, looked like a completely different team than the Clippers who played against the Rockets."
Rswany,They should put Hinrich out to a farm in the country to live out the rest of his days in peace.
Rswany,Mike Dunleavy
Rswany,[Rubio's #420BlazeIt](http://streamable.com/k2ym)
Rswany,"Oh, whoops."
Rswany,Timberwolves would be carrying all the weight in that deal.
Rswany,"He *did* have two terrible possessions and a missed free throw right towards the end that almost lost it, but then he came through and redeemed himself with that clutch layup and corner three.


I say this as a Lebron fan, I mean no disrespect."
Rswany,/r/nba is around 90% male (and that's generous) and has a history of being less than empathetic in situations involving women.
Rswany,"Wow, Irving"
Rswany,"Patty got stiff armed into the ground...

Smh"
Rswany,Really?
Rswany,"So get some ball movement going.

Don't just sit with the ball for 20 seconds and then force up a 3."
Rswany,"&gt; What was taj supposed to do?

Honestly, if he pulls away and allows himself to be tripped they probably call a foul on Delly.

But basically any thing *other* than what he chose to do."
Rswany,FUCK THE BLACKHAWKS
Rswany,"Kevin Garnett at 50ish%?


That seems odd.  Is that for Brooklyn or for the 5-ish games he played with us?"
Rswany,"Poor Timmy and his dementia, he's postin up his own teammates...

:("
Rswany,"&gt; we have had the refs take 2 field goals away

Just no."
Rswany,"Did you see the replay?

I woudnt expect them to call it on the last play but there was some contact."
Rswany,"Lebron missed one 30 seconds before that, too."
Rswany,"Im not saying Lebron *doesnt* have a large fanbase.

[They're basically tied in likability]( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1v_2kLi4JxGxtZ9E---8jbPHw05mzmJ3cflVMQQrgLI8/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)

But Lebron has a ton more people that hate him."

Rswany,"He used to seem like such a great dude..

Rswany,Plus he's built like a brick house
Rswany,"We should ban using still frames to ""prove"" something."
Rswany,"Lol, nice flop my Dunleavy.

That was some soccer-level reaction time.

Rswany,Rehab
Rswany,You're blinded by your Lebron hate.
Rswany,"That's a shit call.

That was a basketball move, Brewer is allowed that space."
Rswany,"Brooks has played quite well all series, imo."
Rswany,"If his middle/inner ear was damaged he would also have temporary issues with his hearing.


It would be easy for a doctor to diagnose.

"
Rswany,"&gt;You didn't say it was because they ran out of gas, you said they weren't playing at the same level.

Those are two ways to say the exact same thing.

They weren't able to play at their high level **because** they ran out of gas.




Had they been able to continue that high level of play they would have had a pretty good chance to beat Golden State.


&gt;Which is stupid. If you can't play through each series at a high level, you don't deserve to keep going. They got beat, and now they're watching at home. End of story.

I never said that wasn't the case.

I was rooting for the Rockets in the Clippers series (and in this GSW one) but the way you guys get so goddamn defensive and abrasive is making me regret that."
Rswany,"vertigo is a symptom of concussion.


And ear problems also of specific symptoms like hearing loss or ear pressure."
Rswany,What about the people complaining about the people complaining about people complaining about the refs?
Rswany,"That was against hobbled old man Kyrie not so much Delly

----

And I just getting downvoted because people don't like Delly?


In game 1 Delly had the same DRtg as Lebron at 98 compared to Kyrie's 103

In game 2 Delly had 96.

The replays have been shitty for both sides all night."
Rswany,"&gt;Right, I agree that the doctor should act regardless of how the player thinks, but I don't think you'll find a lot of team doctors willing to do that unless you have something like the NHL where it's a league rule that mandates they do it.

I've been loving me some TT these playoffs.

It's just crazy how people undervalue Kevin Love."

Rswany,You can't fucking undercut people.
Rswany,Stay salty
Rswany,Korver pushed shump out of bounds
Rswany,I'm surprised that emoji works on my PC.
Rswany,Delly's been playing pretty damn solid defense on Teague (even though he scored 30 last game)
Rswany,Delly's a better defender than hobbled Kyrie at least.
Rswany,"Im secretly glad they didnt call that a foul,"
Rswany,"&gt;You can clearly see him watching the ball the whole time. 

He wasn't watching the ball.

They literally teach you NOT to watch the ball on defense.

He saw TT coming down the lane, saw Delly put up the oop and slide underneath TT.


You can see him brace himself for the contact because he knows TT is there.

&gt;or I'm just missing something but I just don't see how this is a dirty play.

Exactly the definition of being delusional."
Rswany,"Man, if JR got 2 games, that attack's gotta be at least 1."
Rswany,"Delly's not dirty, he's just a hustler/embellisher/irritant.


Kinda like Steven Adams or Luis Scola.

I'm not saying this with spite, I've become a fan of Delly this postseason."

The only people that hated him are like Pistons fans, Knicks fans, Jazz fans, and all the other teams he beat in the playoffs."

Rswany,"Dude, no one's scored on him in the last 10 games!"
Rswany,"Fuck Dunleavy.

Tried to undercut Lebron on a wide-open layup."
Rswany,"Haha! 

Look honey, tonight's entertainment thinks they're people!"
Rswany,"To some degree, maybe.

But despite some turnovers it's not like he was getting stopped every time going to the rim.


He still had some strong layups and got a shit-ton of his assists from driving and dishing.


Same thing happened to Rose, he was having success driving the ball but even he kept settling for jumpers.

Is that because Dellavedova is some lock-down defender?  Because that's what you're saying."
Rswany,"&gt;Regardless of your opinion on the situation...


Lol, you basically said ""Whether you think it was deserved or not it was clearly deserved so if you think it wasn't your opinion is shit"".

"
Rswany,"Lol, Mirotic just got humped."
Rswany,"Lebron has played like shit yet he's probably gonna end with a triple double.


Fucked around and got a triple double."
Rswany,"&gt; Its part of the game.

Are you retarded?

**It's not part of the game** it's an illegal foul and one of the most dangerous ones in the game,"
Rswany,"Kind of offtopic but I wish Flip would stop having his fun as interim head coach and pursue Fred Hoiberg.

Rswany,"/r/nba likes to counter popular opinion.


When he was with the Heat the general public hated him so more often than not /r/nba would have his back.

With his return to Cleveland the general public has looked on him much more favorable so /r/nba has turned into ""DAE miss Heat Lebron when he was the villain?"",  ""More like LePotatoe"", etc...

It is known."

Rswany,Dunleavy flopped like a bitch.
Rswany,"It was okay.

In general it seemed to favor the home team."
Rswany,Dank graphic
Rswany,"&gt;I'd like a replay, could be a shit ref call like the Manu 3 pointer from half court. 

That actually was a good call.

Manu saw that Rivers was going to foul and got both of his hands on the ball before the contact of the foul.

Usually in those situations the player doesnt get both their hands on the ball before the foul.

"
Rswany,"&gt;I don't think he even saw TT coming.

Watch the play again.  He was near the block looking forward and saw TT sprinting towards the lane, looked at Delly passing the ball, then slid and turned 180 in the lane.

He knew exactly what he was doing."
Rswany,"On that note, so does Love."
Rswany,"Blatt be like ""I thought you're supposed to get the ball in to the hands of your best player for the last play..?"""
Rswany,Why don't the Cavs run an offense?
Rswany,"Nah, Dunleavy would have calmly walked away, mentally added Dellevadova to ""the list"", and then stealthily throat punched him later in the game.


Dunleavy is the consummate professional of being a dirty asshole."
Rswany,"Probably not.


Edit:  the same thing happened with the whole Lauren Holtkamp thing.


The amount of individual hate was way disproportionate to her male counterparts.  

Even Joey Crawford didnt get as vehemently hateful things said about him."
Rswany,Just a nice little frustration elbow
Rswany,"I mean it was both.


But a lot of the collapse on their part was because they didn't have a bench and their starters played ridiculous minutes.

If they played at the same level they played the Spurs at (healthy CP3 and all) there's not way you guys pull out the series.  That's not exactly a very controversial sentiment. "
Rswany,"The fuck?

That's like an incredibly severe concussion to be out that long.


Like brain damage severe"
Rswany,Anything is possible.
Rswany,"People accidentally land on peoples feet all the time.  There was nothing dirty about that play.


Have you ever played basketball? That shit happens all the time.

I sprained my ankle pretty badly because I landed on an opposing player's foot but I didnt hold it against him because it's not a dirty play."
Rswany,"Because ""LE CONSPIRACY AGAINST BULLS FAN OMG""



But srsly, it's only a tech if it gets called.

Rswany,"**FUCK DOUG MCDERMOTT**


...wait that doesn't sound right."
Rswany,Not if you're not making a legitimate basketball play (aka: not going for the ball)
Rswany,"They only called it because he managed to get two hands on the ball before the foul contact.

Usually the player never gets that in time."
Rswany,Refs gifting this one with a bow.

Rswany,What the fuck else were they supposed to do to get the clock right?

Rswany,"&gt;My point is that once the playoffs started according to r/nba the Spurs were guaranteed to go to the WCF

That's a pretty presumptuous generalization regardless of any Spurlcejerk.


Also, considering The Warriors have been the favorite to win it all on /r/nba pretty much since the playoffs started I don't know why you're complaining."
Rswany,His ankle's been tweaked since Chicago.
Rswany,Yeah
Rswany,"I'm just saying, Lebron was pissed as fuck at the officials and that shot was just as much of a ""fuck you"" to them as it was to the Bulls."
Rswany,He's also got shorter arms than most big guys which sucks for him on the court but would give him more practical strength and leverage compared the lankier big men.
Rswany,TIL I'm as good of a basketball player as Kirk Hinrich
Rswany,He switched his entire mechanics up and in stints actually looked like a competent shooter.
Rswany,"Lol, he's not wrong.


Not really surprising that the refs didn't see it though, remember last series when Jason Kidd had to jump around shouting like a maniac just to get a timeout late in the game.


Not to mention props to the assistant coaches to corral Blatt back in.

Of the 8 quarters between the two games the Rockets have only ended a quarter with the lead once.

Rswany,"Literally, none of that says the defender can be moving.

It clearly says he must be established in ""legal defensive position"".


Rose was sprinting in front of Lebron then just stopped.  Had he been like 2 steps ahead he would have had time to be established in legal defensive position but in this case he wasn't."

Rswany,Kyrie hurt his knee

That just shows how much better of a team they were."

Not only Lebron's the overuse but his ankle and back are a little fucky.


Plus Kyrie.

Plus Shump's groin."
Rswany,"It's a valid concern even if it ends up not happening.


There's a lot of scientific backing that injuries can compound and lead to more injuries.

"
Rswany,A blunt force to the head hard enough to damage the inner ear would certainly be hard to also potentially cause a concussion.
Rswany,"Zach LaVine's got a pretty smooth stroke.

Gets a lot of air on his jumpshots, too."

Rswany,There was some contact on that play too
Rswany,"Damn that was a pretty dirty play.

Just an uncalled for frustration foul."

Rswany,Rockets are streaky as hell though.

Rswany,"They called the lowered shoulder, not a traditional charge call."
Rswany,was holding him down the lane.
Rswany,Damn Rose fouled the shit out of Kyrie.

He does all the bitching and flopping and *stills* plays out of his fucking mind.


It's much more maddening than if a shitty player flops and whines, haha."
Rswany,He didnt charge and get in the face of the ref
Rswany,Srsly wut
Rswany,That's what a head contusion is.
Rswany,"Yeah, that was kinda iffy, but legal"
Rswany,"If it was middle/inner ear related, yes it would."
Rswany,"He bulldozed Corey Brewer last night so Brewer pulled him down with him.

It was pretty funny."
Rswany,"Yeah, but that would also be accompanied by a little hearing loss and would be easy to diagnose.


And honestly inner ear damage is not joke.  There's delicate bones and membranes and stuff and if the damage is serious enough you would need surgery."

Rswany,"He caught the ball, took 3 steps then passed it.

Technically a travel but it was so quick and they never call that any ways.


Imagine if a player caught the ball took three slow steps and then passed it.  They call a travel on that."
Rswany,"Here's some quotes (take from the Boston Globe but I think they took them from the same interview):

&gt;“There’s a lot of guys that intrigue me, that we’ve looked at, and those are two guys that are on everybody’s board, as they should be not only for what they accomplished the past year but for what they do down the road. I think both of those players are going to be All-Star-type players. But I think when we look at anybody we’re looking at in the draft, it’s how they fit in with the players that we have, what their dynamic is, and how we want to play.”

----

On trading the pick:

&gt;""When you talk about trading the pick, it would have to be a huge-type situation because I feel like there’s three or four players that will be All-Star, All-Pro-type players,” he said. “You’re just not going to give somebody like that away. The positive from our standpoint getting the top pick — we’ve got two great 19-year-olds last year, we got [Adreian] Payne, and we’re waiting to see if [Anthony] Bennett can get healthy and Bennett can develop.

&gt;“They’re all going to be able to kind of mature together. Really similar to the situation Oklahoma City had. We’ve talked about what they’ve been able to do. They’ve been lucky and gotten the right players, and they were able to develop those players, so we’re hoping to follow suit.”

----

On young talent (and trading the pick):

&gt;“When I took the job, I said we were coming here to build a championship team, and what we’re going to do is we want home run hitters and not singles and doubles [hitters].  What I meant by that is you have to have potentially All-Star, All-Pro players. I see a lot of guys in this draft who can be that.

&gt;“Because of the youth of our team and having two 19-year-olds from last year, we’re not going to mortgage our future to facilitate that development. Right now Wiggins is that development. LaVine is that development. [Shabazz] Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng, too, so I would never say never but I don’t see us trading [the No. 1 pick] because all these guys we’re going to have an opportunity to look at, three or four of these guys are going to be All-Star, All-Pro-type players. Those are guys you don’t want to give up on.”

So he's basically almost guaranteed that he's not going to trade the pick.


"
Rswany,"According to Bulls fans it's mostly Cavs fans.


"
Rswany,"Lol, fuck off chris paul, being all amazing n shit."
Rswany,inb4 dino circlejerk
Rswany,Skip?
Rswany,"The original comment was pretty great:

&gt;""It's for all the marbles. I'm sitting in the house loading up the pump, I'm loading up the Uzis, I've got a couple of M-16s, couple of nines, couple of joints with some silencers on them, couple of grenades, got a missile launcher. I'm ready for war.""




"
Rswany,"So it's *everybody else's* fault?

;)"
Rswany,"20% Okafor.


People are vastly overblowing these ""Flip wants Okafor"" rumors."
Rswany,So they called a foul?
Rswany,If you're gonna try and do a sneaky dirty play of course you're not going to look.
Rswany,"Contusions are nothing to scoff at either.

It's basically a localized concussion where the brain is bleeding.

Plus, they're not mutually exclusive injuries:

&gt; While a person with traumatic brain injury might experience contusion without concussion, or concussion 
without contusion, having one does not preclude having the other, and it is common for both to occur 
together. So while cerebral contusions and concussions are different from each other, a victim of head 
trauma might be unlucky enough to have both."
Rswany,"Anyone who thinks is MCW didn't watch Wiggins play.


You can fuccboi around with your stats all night long but stats are only the half of it."
Rswany,"Oh yes.

The ole blind backwards ankle breaker.

It's so obvious.

Fuck off Reggie."
Rswany,That would just encourage trolls
Rswany,Nice pushoff
Rswany,"**They do if** the offensive player doesn't egregiously lower their shoulder/use their elbow/any other non-basketball move.

"
Rswany,For you.
Rswany,"Oh please, if they called a foul on every slight bump games would be 4 hours long."
Rswany,"That's a foul or a travel, dumbass refs."
Rswany,"Lol, they didn't call the foul until the shot missed AND Pau put his arms up in protest."
Rswany,"That's an and 1.

Blake reached"
Rswany,"Looks like we'll have to make due with

(╯°□°)╯︵ sɹǝpunɐS"
Rswany,I miss Pepsi Blue
Rswany,Advanced stats
Rswany,These refs have been awful.
Rswany,"But... 

Your gainz.."
Rswany,"Idk man, it sounds surprisingly loud."
Rswany,"(Just gonna get this out of the way ahead of time)


Wow, fuck Draymond Green, that was such a cheap play!

Rswany,"Pudgy?

Wtf?


Unathletic?

Wtf?




"
Rswany,They're doing what they did to Pirates of the Caribbean (the ride)
Rswany,Horford jumped on Delly.
Rswany,"FUCK DUNLEAVY

DIRTY FUCKIN CUNT"
Rswany,"3 Fouls in 5 minutes.

Classic Austin Rivers."
Rswany,He's been playing a shit-ton of minutes and the fatigue takes a toll on you jumpshot.
Rswany,I still think warriors are top dog.
Rswany,"His defense, shot selection, and work ethic are all atrocious.  


He's like Corey 'Bad Porn' Maggette 2.0 in that, yeah, he does a lot of scoring but are you actually enjoying what you're watching?"
Rswany,"Yeah, with the way the Bulls play, it won't be good on his heart.


WUBALUBADUBDUB"
Rswany,"Kind of a boring qurstion but I cant get enough of the debate;


Who should the Wolves draft?

Towns vs Okafor?"
Rswany,"Shump

;_;"
Rswany,"Yeah, Flip's decent, /r/nba just has a hate-boner towards him for some reason.  

He's not perfect and I'd prefer an actual coach over temporary Flip but he's all right.


"
Rswany,Dunleavy playing like he just learned about behind the back passes.
Rswany,"You can't redefine ""Hero Ball"" NBA, this is proof!"
Rswany,I think a big difference is JR put his hold damn body into his while Dwight just used his arm so JR's looks worse and had a lot more force behind it.
Rswany,Teague whiffed
Rswany,"Although it's subjective, JR's just happened to look a lot more violent with the amount of force and Crowder collapsing.

That definitely plays a part on their decision.


Like even though Horford didnt make good contact with his elbow it looked bad because he cocked it back.

----

Edit: lol, dont downvote *me* im not saying I agree, Im just pointing how they make their decision!"
Rswany,Blatant moving screen on that Curry three.
Rswany,"&gt;Already have one telling me Delly is better than Teague.

That's your fault for feeding trolls."
Rswany,"Nice illegal screen by Carrol, too."
Rswany,If only the Spurs were here
Rswany,I feel the exact same
Rswany,"I am getting so shump, I'm gonna shump my clohtes off"
Rswany,Blake molesting BoBo
Rswany,INSUFFERABLY 
Rswany,"&gt;So Brewer grabs Draymond,

After green knocked him over with an illegal screen
"
Rswany,I admire your optimism!
Rswany,"In the east?


They might have.


But yeah, probably not."
Rswany,Noah literally cant even
Rswany,"Honestly, that shot wasn't that bad.

Noah was playing like 5 feet off of him."
Rswany,"I mean, I believe afterwards he felt bad and and stuff but in the heat of the moment that was definitely a frustration play he wasnt trying to make a clean play on the ball.


Just because you apologize doesnt mean it wasnt a dirty play
"
Rswany,And 1..?
Rswany,"Lol, Draymond almost punched the ref"
Rswany,I dont think Griffin has set a legal screen all game.
Rswany,SQUAD
Rswany,He's moving like he's as old as Uncle Drew.
Rswany,"If I was sitting courtside I would never stop hollering ""CAAAROOOL!    CAAAROL!"" in Charlie's voice."
Rswany,"Any call involving Lebron is just assumed to be a horrible call.


""OMG FUCKING GOALTEND!""

\*replay shows*

""Oh.. uh..  nvm, good call..."""
Rswany,I don't think so.
Rswany,Wut
Rswany,Clips are incapable of illegal screens.
Rswany,Thank you Chris for correcting dumbass Reggie.
Rswany,Lol this is a horrible article.
Rswany,The Seahawks of the NBA
Rswany,"1993 called, they want their casual observation back."
Rswany,"""Leg lock""

"
Rswany,"Lol, in every other thread Warriors are defensively insisting there's nothing to worry about with Klay and Steph but now when it's convenient to play the victim, it's a 180."
Rswany,And needing 3 consecutive inbounds plays at half court.
Rswany,"Lol, Delly vs AB is the best matchup in this series."
Rswany,"We've been doing our best to bring the West down with horrible picks.


 #6 pick Johnny Flynn

 #4 pick Wesley Johnson

 #2 pick Derrick Williams
"
Rswany,"Yeah, but HOW DARE people speculate about an NBA player on an NBA discussion forum.


How outrageous!"
Rswany,"Really?

You new around here, son?"
Rswany,"As far as 2013 and 2014

Mosgov &gt; Birdman

TT &lt; Bosh (even though TT's been out of his mind)

Shump + JR &gt; 40yo Allen + Battier

Irving &lt; Wade (could be argued either way)

Delly = Chalmers/Cole ?

James Jones = James Jones



It's pretty even, the edge is probably Miami but if Love and Verajao were healthy you might have to give the edge to Cavs."
Rswany,He fucks around and (almost) gets a triple double
Rswany,No he's not.
Rswany,What's curry bitching about?
Rswany,They literally haven't called a travel on a play like that since 'Nam
Rswany,"Maybe in previous seasons and this past offseason, but not so much this season."
Rswany,"Rockets have only been leading once at the end of a quarter all series.

And that was at the end of the first quarter of game 1."
Rswany,"Those damn illegal screens are every where.


And they randomly decided to call them in the CLE/ATL game 1 and every one got pissed, haha.

It was great."
Rswany,"Best series was round 1 Spurs vs Clips, imo...

"
Rswany,"Lol, this reads like high school gossip.


WILL PELICANS ASK THIBIDEAU TO THE PROM?!!?!"
Rswany,"That was like 5 years ago.


Plus Scola seems to bring these things on himself, he always on the receiving end of plays like this.  He's a baiter and an aggrevator."
Rswany,"Lol, Shump talking shit to Dunleavy.

Good. "
Rswany,"Lol, Clippers get the ball,

Paul still jaws with the refs."
Rswany,"Imagine if Love was in instead of James Jones right now.


:/"
Rswany,"It's *probably* KG's last year, too.

:("
Rswany,Wasn't even close to set.
Rswany,"&gt;So if a dude 8 inches taller than you bum rushes you and two-hand shoves you to the ground from behind, you're not going to retaliate at all?  and in response to the relatiation (which was a weak-ass leg lock), the guy makes a move to kick and taunt him while he's still on the ground, and yet its the guy on the ground that is the only dirty one because of the leg lock? 


People are just delusioned by their cavs hate.
"
Rswany,Blake can do no wrong.
Rswany,He needs to improve his finishing at the rim(hopefully puttin on some lbs will help) but he was far from unable to finish through contact this year.
Rswany,"Yeah, wtf was that?"
Rswany,He still had his baby fat
Rswany,[Are we posting our rare Dellys?](http://i.imgur.com/n5pYpLx.png)
Rswany,"Jeez man, I remember my first beer...."
Rswany,Any examples?
Rswany,Seemed like a pretty general question
Rswany,Just popping in to say that Gasol getting punched in the face from Draymond *and* given a foul for it was fucking ridiculous.
Rswany,"Quick, put your bets in now."
Rswany,When have the refs **EVER** been lenient went a player throws an away-from-the-play elbow?
Rswany,He lived in Akron.
Rswany,You guys *were* being *kinda* shitty about it.
Rswany,Thank you
Rswany,"No, Im not retarded"
Rswany,"They already called a goaltend on the cavs this game.

Dont be such a conspiritard"
Rswany,Why was he so pissed at first?
Rswany,"The play by Teague was shameful.

Made a nice move and was wide open 6 ft away from the basket but he passed up the wide open shot to jump into JR Smith to try and draw a foul."
Rswany,Bonus?
Rswany,"We're more well mannered than mormons!



"
Rswany,"Most ""dirty"" plays are just done in frustration not deliberate attempts to injure someone.

That doesnt mean they're not dirty."
Rswany,"If that was Delly people would literally riot.


Pls be okay Steph"
Rswany,Pass that ball around and it takes just as much effort.
Rswany,It's not really about time it's when he gathered the ball.
Rswany,"How the fuck could anyone know this?

He was blindly swinging his arm backwards; obviously with the intent to make contact with Bogut but not really aimed anywhere. "
Rswany,"Still a bit sketchy they didn't put him through *any* tests just based on the impact.


Obviously, a competitive player isn't going to admit they have any symptoms if it means it will keep them away from playing."
Rswany,"JR wasn't ""ignoring his teammates"" it was the end of the half."
Rswany,It is known.
Rswany,"You just have to take de plej

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


^^there's ^^a ^^button ^^on ^^the ^^sidebar"
Rswany,"The only thing this comment was missing was ""You guys are gonna be scary next year, clipsbros!"" and the circlejerk would have been complete."
Rswany,"I meant as far as the ejection goes.

It's a zero-tolerance policy.

Obviously, only if they see it though, they didn't see Dunleavy's until after the game so they couldn't eject him for it."
Rswany,"Was that assessed after the replay?

Are they even allowed to do that?  A retroactive foul?"
Rswany,If you weren't a Bulls fan this would have been downvoted to -20 by your brethren.
Rswany,"It wasn't a rebound.

It was an alley opp which he also saw."
Rswany,I think these refs browse /r/nba
Rswany,"Idk, Rubio adds so much to the team when he plays.

To the point where we're a completely different team when he's on the court."
Rswany,I'm never drinking again.
Rswany,They've been allowing it all game
Rswany,"/r/nba would love to see Cavs eliminated.

What you talkin about?"
Rswany,"If a team is leading an entire game and the opponent manages to cut the lead to single digits right at the end that doesnt mean it was competitive.


Also, thanks for the downvote, asshole..."
Rswany,"Well, yeah..."
Rswany,Except Thibideau and Bulls management had been feuding for some time.
Rswany,"Just a joke.

I was rooting for the Cavs but those stagnated isos in the 4th had me scratching my head.

Those were a big part of letting the Bulls back into it."
Rswany,"I was about 90% joking, so..."
Rswany,"I think it's just a salty person.

Cavs fans are getting downvoted, too."
Rswany,Blinded by Cavs hate
Rswany,You have to be mentally ill to watch the Korver replay and think Delly did it on purpose...
Rswany,"""Man, Delly is shooting fucking awful tonight..."""
Rswany,Who was it that made a shot that was like 5 feet inside the 3pt line and they called it a three?
Rswany,Don't forget the angry fans
Rswany,"Honestly, it *usually* is okay.


Last night he was horrible though.

He went like 0/3 last night from 3."
Rswany,The fact that your comment has 3 upvotes makes me question /r/nba's subscriber base.
Rswany,"&gt;And the reason for that was the clown car of big men we trotted out there every night. Not one of our few actaully dynamic players.

Obviously, losses can't be attributed to a single factor but Martin stagnating the offense and being a liability on defense doesn't help.


&gt;Plus I'd bet a fortune that our record in games where he got at least 30 was a hell of a lot better than it was in games where he didn't.

The record is like 3-6 or something when he scored 30+ in a T-wolves uni.  

So .333 win % vs .357 win % in the two years he's been here.


Regardless, it's not something we should be striving for."
Rswany,"Call that shit on Griffin then.

"
Rswany,"They would have ran the exact same 'play'...

"
Rswany,"

&gt;thats funny because KLove is a solid no 2 too (at best), 

Have people really forgotten how good K-Love was?

He finished 6th in MVP voting once upon a time.


Call it stat-padding or whatever but you still have to have the skill and talent to get the ludicrous stats he was putting up."
Rswany,"This game is over.

Pau with the dagger FTs"
Rswany,Middle school.
Rswany,"Hey dumbasses, the Cavs are winning because they started making shots and ATL started missing shots not because ""OMG REFBALL"""
Rswany,"True.

But how bout dat block las night tho!"
Rswany,"That anecdotal evidence wraps it up, we're done here boys."
Rswany,"Lol, the liberal use of  ""leglock"" still makes me laugh."
Rswany,"&gt;Yup mostly you though.

?

&gt;I highly recommend sorting by controversial for some really insightful conversations

The [controversial comments aren't terrible](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/36th2k/game_thread_houston_rockets_01_golden_state/?sort=controversial)

Basically what you'd expect:

Harden's a choker:

&gt;LOL at harden passing the ball with 2 seconds left. He was just scared of the moment.

Draymond Green is a douche:

&gt;Goddamn Green is a fucking pussy.

Rockets fans are annoying:

&gt;is it me or are rockets fans the whiniest babies in the whole wide world? your team is good as fuck but holy shit your guys' incessant whining is unbearable in these threads

Warriors fans are annoying.

&gt;Damn Dubs are the Seahawks of the NFL. So good, so fun, all their fans are 12 or just found out the team existed 8 months ago.


It general, Rockets fans and Warriors fans are some of the more abrasive in /r/nba so it just leads to toxic gamethreads."
Rswany,Bad joke is bad.
Rswany,"Now all those people who did the whole ""LOL AT THESE FUCKING REDDIT DOCTORS SPECULATING HE MIGHT HAVE A CONCUSSION"" can put their damn foot in their mouths.


Even if he ended up not having a concussion why is it an outrage that people on an NBA discussion forum would have speculative discussions?



It also raises questions about team doctors and their concussion protocol, they all but almost let him go back in and play.

You guys are just being defensive assholes."
Rswany,Weak charge call
Rswany,The Clipbulls
Rswany,"Except we still lose because of all those things I mentioned like what happened whenever he dropped 30+ this past year.

:/"
Rswany,"1.  It was obvious Dunleavy purposely slid in front of Thompson without any intent of contesting his shot.

2.  Even if it *wasn't* blatantly obvious Dunleavy has a long history of undercutting people.


Between both of those things you have to be incredibly biased to still be defending that play."
Rswany,"Still, ""the great white hope"" basically implies there are no good white players in the league."
Rswany,"Houston is goddamn large.


More like *Hugeston*"
Rswany,Lol
Rswany,"Ive been in a real leg lock not this silly thing people are calling a leg lock.

And unless Delly has groin muscles of steel it would be pretty easy to pull away from such an awkward hold.


And if you get tripped, even better, they probably call a foul on Delly."
Rswany,"Yeah, fuck the bulls!"
Rswany,"""set"" is a direct synonym to ""established"" (so I'm kind of just being redundant tbh)

You can look it up in a thesaurus if you really wish but you're grasping at straws."
Rswany,"Lol, nice head flail flop"
Rswany,"Yeah, but those are essentially just facts of the game.

There's not a lot of room for subjectivity on those two topics."
Rswany,This has been one of the better reffed games of the playoffs
Rswany,"Yall who come to the free talk friday thread to talk NBA are doin it wrong.


FTF threads are for taking a break from NBA bullshit and discussing other crazy shit.


Like what type of beverage pairs best with a nice chicken cordon bleu, etc..."
Rswany,Not really
Rswany,"Dunleavy undercut TT.

Otherwise TT had position and probably would have got that rebound"
Rswany,"His overseas coaches were idiots and specifically told him not to work on his shot because he wasnt needed to shoot.


So his early Euro-ball is basically *why* his shot was messed up, not vice versa."
Rswany,"&gt;Not being able to throw the ball in has almost zero to do with the play call

It is when the players don't even run a play.


The play consisted of all the Cavs just kind of jogging in a half circle.

You run a little pick play with a roll and you'll have no problem getting the ball in.  "
Rswany,"Then why did he settle for shoving Lebron's shoulder?

If you're not in position to make a play on the ball then don't just foul him and **that's why they called it that**."
Rswany,/r/nba unites in it's Cavs hate.
Rswany,"Cavs outplaying the Bulls all game but everyone is just gonna say it's rigged because the ejection.

I say that as someone rooting for them."
Rswany,Dramatic?
Rswany,"&gt;Delladova probably shouldn't have leg locked, but it's not that big a deal.

Little shit like that happens all the time in games.

"
Rswany,"Rubio's intangibles are ridiculous.


He makes every single player on the team better.


But everyone discredits him because of his poor shooting.



He's like and RPG character everyone overlooks because his attack and strength are low but if he's in your party each of your other guys gets +10 to all their stats."
Rswany,"Lol, watch out Magic, Bron is gunnin' for that assist record."
Rswany,k.
Rswany,"Yall are crazy.

That was a pretty textbook flagrant based on the criteria:

1. The severity of the contact;



**2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are present such as recklessness and hard contact to the head);**


**3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player's arm or hand, the fouling player wound up and/or followed through after making contact;**


**4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);**


5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and


6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation)."
Rswany,"Seriously, little cheap shit like that happens all the time.


People were acting like Delly kicked Taj's dog.


Not that it is excusable and Delly deserved some punishment but Taj also deserves what he got for retaliating.

"
Rswany,"Wow, really?

I dont remember that."
Rswany,Oh I thought he was actually playing video games.
Rswany,Basically any thing besides retaliating like he did would have been better.
Rswany,"What do we got?   Like 4 first round playoff exits and the WCF run in '04?

Hooray!"
Rswany,Which are both subjective terms.
Rswany,"What does that make you?

Bitching about people bitching about people bitching."
Rswany,"Mozgov's just gotta flush that shit.

Be strong big fella."
Rswany,"&gt;Even people going so far to call him gay (as an attack on his manhood, not as if there's something wrong with being gay). 

That's just those dumb trash talk videos.

"
Rswany,"His agent put out the statement.

Regardless, I'll say again, why is is such a bad thing for people to discuss NBA players on an NBA discussion forum?


The league said Dwights foul was only a flagrant 1 so I guess we shouldn't be allowed to discuss it?"
Rswany,herr derr refball
Rswany,r they tho?
Rswany,Why is the farthest ref calling that foul?
Rswany,"#**Warning, major spoiler for the Hawks**:


^Don't ^leave ^guys ^wide ^open"
Rswany,Brand?
Rswany,"&gt;You've obviously never played organized basketball. 


Fuck off.

Refs were making shitty calls against the Cavs, too, but they played through it and made their shots.

Dont be such a bitch,
"
Rswany,"That's such a weak-ass foul...

A huge foul too giving Delly 3."
Rswany,"His lips will be where you take the hit

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

It keeps on giving."
Rswany,KG...?

He he drove into the middle Dunleavy would sag off and he could dish to Shump for a wide open 3."

Rswany,"Bulls fans be like ""NAH-UH, WE'RE PLAYING WORSE!"""
Rswany,Korver was actually jumping out to prevent a wide-open Shump 3pt
Rswany,"That was actually a huge part of the Bulls comeback.


Cavs should have never stopped attacking the basketball.

Especially with Taj gone and Noah in a little bit of foul trouble.

It doesn't have to be Bron either since he was tired."
Rswany,They've explicitly said Flip is only coaching until they find a notable replacement.
Rswany,"Lol,  when Jimmy barely landed on Lebron's foot?


That wasnt intentional and happens about 3 times any given game."
Rswany,"&gt;Wiggins had his moments but lets keep it real here man. He was a inexperienced rookie and it showed.

&gt;He play good at times but nothing I would put at great of a season. 

That's all just empty criticism.  All you're saying is ""he played bad"".


**How** exactly did he play bad?



His biggest weaknesses were his ball handling and his shooting, but his 1-on-1 offense *and* defense were very impressive.
"
Rswany,Weak-ass call
Rswany,That seems blasphemous coming from a Celtics fan.
Rswany,You gotta be sippin' on some strong delusion to look at that play and think it was intentional.

Rswany,"Jesus christ...

That's all part of what they take into account on flagrant fouls.

1. The severity of the contact;
2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are present such as recklessness and hard contact to the head);
3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player's arm or hand, the fouling player wound up and/or followed through after making contact;
4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);
5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and
6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).

JR SMOOTH"
Rswany,"Why's he so hesitant, then?"
Rswany,"That's like saying Noah blew this game because of that late foul.

If they don't call it, it doesn't really matter."
Rswany,The sound guy would absolutely hear it.
Rswany,In a 5 minute stretch that got them back into the game.
Rswany,"Is every player on the Bulls dirty besides Rose?  Maybe Jimmy G?

----

edit: Gasol's chill too"
Rswany,"He's wide open.

Not a terrible shot."
Rswany,"I feel like this is more about having players respect and buy in to their coach rather than just pure quality of coaching.


You can be a bad coach and still have the players buy into him and you can be a good coach and not have the players on board (like Thibs in Chicago.)


I'm not sold that Flip is a high quality coach but at the very least I think the players still buy in to him and respect him."
Rswany,"Lol, Bulls lookin like the clippers with the synchronized team arm raise."
Rswany,"Bad pass tbh.

1-2 feet shorter and Kawhi has a good chance of putting it in."
Rswany,"Stayed in front of him well, Teague just made a good shot."
Rswany,"Pretty much all the good ones, haha.


Warriors, Bulls, Clippers, Rockets..."
Rswany,Adorable.
Rswany,"Splitter is fucking awful.

Why is he hedging 15 feet forward on the ball screens"
Rswany,"""Kill me"""
Rswany,And plenty of talented white guys in the league...
Rswany,Geraffes r so dumb
Rswany,Whatever label makes you feel better.
Rswany,"They've done it before for ""get of me"" punches.


Even Ron Artest's nasty elbow on Harden was a ""get off me"" elbow in response to Harden putting his hands on him.  (of course, that's probably the most egregious example)."
Rswany,"That foul looked 100x worse in fast motion.


Wasn't really all that bad in slowmo."
Rswany,These refs are bretty bad.
Rswany,"&gt; I think Bulls fans talk a lot of shit ~~about LeBron, given the fact that their team has never beaten him.~~

"
Rswany,That was game 1 vs the Bucks
Rswany,The Delly is open late tonight.
Rswany,"The explanation on [the one where Lebron fell](http://streamable.com/elyn) makes no sense

&gt;Teague (ATL) is in legal guarding position when James (CLE) attempts to jump/slip by him.
Video


Since when does ""legal guarding position"" mean you're allowed to trip a player dribbling past you? 

He also got a small piece of Lebron's elbow, too."
Rswany,Cheap-ass undercut from Dunleavy...
Rswany,"On a charge, yeah, thus the ""established"""
Rswany,"Those are common phrases though.



Players still get fined if they do the throat slit gesture and other such things.

Didnt some players get in trouble for finger guns?


Besides, it's social media which is PR, so you cant get away with as much stuff (whether that's ""right"" or not)."
Rswany,Stfu Reggie
Rswany,"Once again, **I'm not saying I believe this** but there have been plenty of people in the gamethread and postgame thread that are question how good the Warriors are or ever were this season.

They haven't just been saying ""Golly gee, the Grizz sure counter the Warriors"", it's been much more reactionary and much less civil."
Rswany,"Fuck this ""stand for 15 seconds"" offense shit."
Rswany,The first two WCF games were pretty one-sided despite the Rockets fighting back into it in game 2
Rswany,"Lol.

The ball just happened to bounce to him.

""Gotta admire that effort!"""
Rswany,**Lol**
Rswany,"Lebron with the biggest ""FUCK YOU"" to the refs ever."
Rswany,"Dude, Ive never seen Okafor wear baggy chinos."
Rswany,Delly accidentally got on the wrong bus route and it took him to lob city.
Rswany,Blake Griffin did it tho
Rswany,These refs have been very homely so far tonight
Rswany,Verajao looks like a Prince of Dorne
Rswany,[TY Based Vanilla Ice](http://i.imgur.com/noDorii.gif)
Rswany,"Lol, a little reactionary in this thread.

Noah gets 2 buckets and all of a sudden it's ""NOAH IS BACK!"""
Rswany,"&gt;Concussions are weird, and sometimes don't show up immediately

Except when he is dizzy and vomiting the same night of the game.



"
Rswany,"If it's that little it's not a foul basically.


You really have to disrupt the landing for it to be a foul.

Even the Duncan was was *kind of* questionable."
Rswany,"Wow.

Blatant travel and gifted them 3pt..."
Rswany,WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Rswany,"""I am disappoint"""
Rswany,"If he would have been shooting they would have called that kind reach, why is it special treatment if he's not shooting?"
Rswany,Fuck Noah.
Rswany,"Lol, yall always gotta find something to hate Lebron for."
Rswany,"Shitty bailout call.

Thompson wasn't even in the air."
Rswany,My F5 key isnt ready
Rswany,"People saying ""can't believe Clippers are still in this"" are seriously downplaying the amount of threes they made to keep them in the game."
Rswany,"That was on Mozgov?

Terrible call."
Rswany,One of the COAT: Clutchest of all time
Rswany,"Actually, the TCs just got voted fittest metro area or something recently."
Rswany,"Considering Lebron's had about 10 of those fouls called on him this series, that's a fair call."
Rswany,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Rswany,"Lol, that delayed reaction.

"
Rswany,For some reason the Bulls gamethreads have been the worst this playoffs.
Rswany,Holy fuck
Rswany,"Reggie was one of the biggest irritants of all time.

Rswany,Every one is just dying.
Rswany,Mark'd be Tywin.
Rswany,"Blake gets away with illegal screens every time.

Without fail."
Rswany,Wtf..  just the other day Clippers fans were complaining about Matty B's poor play this series...
Rswany,JR Smith got mugged on that board.
Rswany,Rhetorical question.
Rswany,"It's mild but I think it's the arrogance like ""We'll win, no biggie, we've done it before"" type of deal."
Rswany,"This is a dramatic-ass title, OP.


This is some TMZ shit."
Rswany,If anyone could get pushed over by Crawford it's Patty Mills.
Rswany,"Yeah, K-Mart is a huge liability on D.


It's one of the reasons I wouldnt be devastated if we ended up trading him."
Rswany,Refs gift wrapped it
Rswany,"Yeah, but why you forego a simple safety precaution based on an guess that it *might* just be from his inner ear getting wobbled?"
Rswany,"Millsap sees he gets blocked,

collapses to the ground."
Rswany,"Lol, wtf Rockets?  Get your shit together."
Rswany,"Flop, but you can't fucking lean into screens like that.

edit: I'm saying I agree with the call you jerks.  :(

"
Rswany,Or D-Rose on the same play as Noah's
Rswany,Are you having a stroke?
Rswany,lmao that niko derp face.
Rswany,Then you havent been watching the games.
Rswany,Lebron let Butler have a free layup...
Rswany,This comment is ridiculous.
Rswany,"No downvoting in /r/nfl?


Lol

That'd be the day..."
Rswany,Out of all the times Lebron has hooked someone that was not one of them.
Rswany,Mirotic walked all the way back to Montenegro
Rswany,Or maybe when you irrationally blame Dellavedova the normal people in /r/nba are smart enough to know you're being irrational.
Rswany,"*Oh please*,

If this was a Paul Pierce quote /r/nba would be jizzing their pants with how ""badass"" it is..."
Rswany,"Well yeah...

Because he gave howard a little shove to clear him out."
Rswany,What about Rose bulldozing Shump to get Butler open?
Rswany,"It's from the paid part of kenpom.com

one of our guys in /r/timberwolves is a subscriber and posted them for us."
Rswany,#SHAKE THEM DREADS
Rswany,Except for the whole unnecessarily mentioning and leading with Dellavedova.
Rswany,"Considering yall were saying how you had the ECF on lock after Love got injured I think ""overrated"" is the correct term."
Rswany,"Why does Griffin never get called for fouls?

"
Rswany,D-Rose inadvertently punched J. Jones in the face.
Rswany,"*Oh please*

if a player was grabbing a players arm on the ground after a whistle and the player then punched him to get his arm free people wouldn't be surprised at all at an ejection.


"
Rswany,"Wow, that was weaaaaak."
Rswany,"Lol, this poll is really lending some credence to all the jokes that /r/nba has a big boner for Steph Curry."
Rswany,"&gt;Okafor wants to be in LA things are true.

I'm skeptical about those rumors, too.

I guess I'm just a big ol skeptic about everything, haha."
Rswany,"No I'm talking about his second dribble, not the move he used to get past Shump (or Irving).

After that move, the ball bounced all the way up over his head"
Rswany,"Sure you can.

You can play physical, no-easy-buckets type defense without cheapshotting players, pushing guys away from the play, and flopping.


And you can talk trash without being super petty about it as well."
Rswany,"&gt;Cavs are a better team without a banged-up Irving anyway.

I think they are.

Kyrie was getting burned on so many defensive possessions in game 1."
Rswany,Nice block!
Rswany,They came in like a 5 minute stretch and are the single reason you're still in this game.
Rswany,"[Here bruh, you can use this](http://gfycat.com/GoldenSoggyAlbertosaurus)"

Rswany,"&gt;But not enough to actually be a competent shooter for any meaningful length of time. As a Celtics fan I did the same mental gymnastics with Rondo. 

Fuck you *and* your ""mental gymnastics"".

No one's saying he's guaranteed to become a bonafide shooter, just that he's shown large glimpses of improvement."
Rswany,"Yeah, thank god they had all that time to draw up that intricate ""give lebron the ball"" play."
Rswany,I always have my rare Delly's on hand.
Rswany,&gt;Postseason of runs
Rswany,Because he's the one undercutting them down.
Rswany,You mean a player battling for a rebound used his legs to propel himself towards an opponent?
Rswany,"Rubio rebounds quite well.

Not quite Rondo well, but pretty well."
Rswany,"Since when is hustling for loose balls ""careless/reckless""?

That's just parroting what the commentators said, furthering the narrative.

Those were pretty bad here."
Rswany,"A person from texas being casually racist?

Well I never..."
Rswany,BullsRunThisTown is consistently one of the worst commenters on /r/nba
Rswany,"Did refs all get together before the playoffs and decide they'll never again call an illegal screen?


Seems like in all of the series there have been more illegal screens than legal."
Rswany,"Holy fuck.

Lebron just made Butler his bitch!"
Rswany,"That's either off Lebron, or a foul..."
Rswany,Pauls been doing that since before Harden was even in the league.
Rswany,Delly vs AB is a lowkey great 1 v 1 matchup
Rswany,Bibby can still grow hair?
Rswany,Yall motherfuckers dont know any thibg about public relations.
Rswany,Just in last series he umdercut Lebron and undercut TT and made him land on his head
Rswany,"Kevin Love, am I right, /r/nba?"
Rswany,"""he knows how to draw a foul""

That's a nice way to say ""knows how to flop like a bitch""."
Rswany,How?
Rswany,"Niko is just trying to get fouls, not even trying to get a good shot."
Rswany,"/r/nba will overreact with:

""Yeah, the Warriors just werent actually that good this year""


""The Hawks just arent good enough to take that next step.  Their regular season was a fluke.  They got no superstar.  ""


""Harden just isnt good enough to lead a team in the playoffs."""
Rswany,"Surprisingly CP3 and Crawford both have 10 pts each.


CP3 shooting 44% and Crawford 30%, though."
Rswany,"Yours wasn't even a joke.

It was just defensive sarcasm because you can't take a joke."
Rswany,"These refs, jesus christ"
Rswany,That's why you don't leave your feet when you try to pass.
Rswany,Gasol played really well game 1.
Rswany,"Don't worry Hawks.


You just need to hope Lebron plays his conservative iso-ball™ in the 4th"
Rswany,"Clean block.

Fuck you refs"
Rswany,/r/nba loves Curry a lot more than Lebron tho
Rswany,He's been playing through a groin sprain since game 2 against the Bulls.
Rswany,Really makes me wonder how young /r/nba truly is..
Rswany,"Lol, 99% of your comments are just bitching about Manu.

You secretly have a crush on him, dont you?"
Rswany,"Lol, you youngdubs are so spoiled you cant even handle a couple ""big meanies"" in the gamethread"
Rswany,Kyrie is a bad man.
Rswany,I feel a strange comfort whenever Diaw has the ball.
Rswany,"3 games is hardly a sample size.

But regardless it sounds like you have no interest in changing your mind.


I should know better than to try and defend one of /r/nba's favorite punching bags."
Rswany,He took duh plej
Rswany,His offense has been shit
Rswany,"Dude, Ex Machina kicked ass."
Rswany,"**IF THIS SERIES ENDS BECAUSE A FUCKING FLOP...**

Rswany,"&gt;StephBabyGreenEyes

Lol k.


Considering how successful the Spurs franchise has been it's crazy how unabrasive their fans are.

Even if they're just being faux-classy it's better than not having any class at all.

"
Rswany,Bron needs to stop settling for fadeaway jumpers.
Rswany,"People exaggerate how likely Love is to leave, imo.


Especially the media."
Rswany,Splitter hedged and switched like 15ft out of position
Rswany,"Lol, why did the crowd cheer?  That was about 10 seconds after the whistle"
Rswany,"Solid defense and a couple big 3pt shots.

Can't really ask for much more."
Rswany,Off TT but shoulda been a foul.
Rswany,"Someone deserves to get fired, haha."
Rswany,Jesus christ...
Rswany,"Rubio.


We're an entirely different team when he's healthy.  He makes every teammate better."
Rswany,"Eye-test.

Stats only make up half of basketball.

Ricky was a lot more confident and made some big shots. 

And as I said, you could physically see he changed his shot mechanics.

One negative was that his finishing at the rim was still atrocious which kills his %."
Rswany,"Delly was pissed Taj nailed him with a cheap screen *and* shoved him into the ground.

Still a cheap move from Delly but inexcusable from Taj."
Rswany,"The same thing happened against the Bulls.

I don't think it's ""luck""."
Rswany,Lol wut
Rswany,"Out of all the fouls that could have been called they call that one?

Lol."
Rswany,"&gt;Push-off offensive fouls

That one was a pretty obvious flop."
Rswany,Bazemore's been like their 2nd best player this series.
Rswany,"Advanced stats peg Towns as the more efficient offensive player.


But Okafor definitely wins the eye test"
Rswany,So...  he went after him but he's not dirty?
Rswany,"Butler was basically diving headlong into the defenders who were standing straight-up.

Glad they weren't calling that crap."
Rswany,"There was certainly exaggerated contact.

"
Rswany,"Lol, Harden slide at least 10 feet"

Allen was 37+ years old.


Prime Allen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JR but old Allen is debatable.

Rswany,Noah's talent got swallowed by a whale.
Rswany,"&gt;The dribbler must be in control of his body at all times. If illegal contact occurs

Lebron driving hard isn't out of control or illegal contact in any way.


If he lowered his shoulder or used his elbow or something than yes that's what that statute is referring to but Lebron didn't do either of those things."
Rswany,Blake is gonna be gassed if he plays the whole quarter

Seems like he's been dealing with that coupled with exhaustion."

The first elbow was incidental and the 2nd shot was in retaliation to Niko bear-hugging him from behind.

That's a bitchass move and as I said, one of the most dangerous plays in the game.

"
Rswany,I wish the refs would not let them get away with so many illegal screens but it was a good game nonetheless
Rswany,Then they better hope Jimmy and Rose stay hot.
Rswany,"Yeah, his outside shot is ugly and he's not nearly big enough to bang ib the post.

He's athletic af tho"
Rswany,"&gt;But what if you got knocked over while locked up and tore your ACL?

Then he probably wouldn't be in any shape to retaliate.


But your argument is dumb.  You could just as easily say ""what if the other player tears their ACL from the retaliation?""

Bottom line is no matter how much a retaliation might be warranted you can't do it on the court, it just hurts your team."

Rswany,"Based on the rest of his quotes I think he was just being really sarcastic, not getting into the team politics of ejections and provoking."
Rswany,"Nah, Lebron's stagnant isos were a big reason behind the comeback."
Rswany,"Lol, Noah was just being fair, he knew they probably should have been assessed a shotclock violation originally."

Maybe he was just being polite, but he seems like a pretty well-spoken, humble, dude, rather than a diva.

With that being said I still think Clips are top 3 to win it."
Rswany,These refs fucked up this game

Rswany,Is Noah gonna call Moz a pussy for posterizing him?
Rswany,"Still looked like Rose travelled.

He caught the ball, took 3 steps, then stopped without a dribble.


Granted they usually let players get away with 3 steps if they're gathering for a layup but not if it is just walking without dribbling."

Are these the people that vote him into the all-star game every year?
Seriously, stop pretending he isn't some massively popular megastar.  The dude got voted into the all-star game last year even though he was injured all year.. No one is forgetting anything."

ZombieLincoln666,He's a beast. A monster
ZombieLincoln666,I've seen a few players do it actually. The league might want to crack down on it
ZombieLincoln666,Bill Simmons was the highest paid talent at ESPN and does way more than Barkley
ZombieLincoln666,He was in the NBA at that point 
ZombieLincoln666,[more like](http://www.smashbros.com/images/og/samus.jpg)
ZombieLincoln666,I get the feeling that people are expecting him to score 20 a game...
ZombieLincoln666,Well I hope they enjoyed all the clicks it generated while it lasted.
ZombieLincoln666,"For this whole season, Memphis has about 1.039 times more free throw attempts than GSW

This game, they have 3 times as many."
ZombieLincoln666,""".. pledge"""
ZombieLincoln666,"He should have just said he meant to give a high five, but missed"
ZombieLincoln666,"Most people have no problem calling him the 2nd greatest SG of all time.

"
ZombieLincoln666,Rockets aren't losing if they shoot 3's at 43%
ZombieLincoln666,Or maybe the reason they're bigger names on the defensive end is because they know how to get away with it
ZombieLincoln666,that's hilarious
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm sorry, but the fact that K Love is injured doesn't help the Cavs beat the Hawks."
ZombieLincoln666,lol no
ZombieLincoln666,People don't like it when you point that out. They like to pretend the offense is beautifully orchestrated by Blatt and it isn't just LeBron running high pick and rolls into isos 
ZombieLincoln666,"So you want me to compare web traffic to TV viewership numbers, as if they are remotely the same thing?"
ZombieLincoln666,"that was a pretty good Heat team though. 

Dellavedova is the Cavs 7th best player..."
ZombieLincoln666,"It's because he is the Coach's/GM's son, and if it weren't for that he'd be headed for the D-league "
ZombieLincoln666,he's a nice boy
ZombieLincoln666,I feel like I've seen this post multiple times
ZombieLincoln666,"I swear, Cavs are better at shooting stupid shots than good ones"
ZombieLincoln666,"You followed that up with:

&gt;but once you get to the playoffs what you did in the regular season still doesn't matter

How do explain the fact that the four teams left were the highest seeded coming into the playoffs? The regular season record is clearly a decent indicator of playoff success."
ZombieLincoln666,"FYI, GSW is undefeated when they've gone up 15 in a game"
ZombieLincoln666,"Alright hawks, stop taking jumpers"
ZombieLincoln666,"One could argue our ""race"" issues are also culture issues. "
ZombieLincoln666,If LeBron had his jump shot going that would help a lot
ZombieLincoln666,i can't get enough of your opinions
ZombieLincoln666,"I know everyone jokes on Austin, but seriously, he doesn't look like he belongs in the NBA. "
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Cavs were playing this well defensively with Love

That's definitely not true."
ZombieLincoln666,that's amazing
ZombieLincoln666,Steph Curry is a better defender than Westbrook.
ZombieLincoln666,"McHale just signed a contract extension in December. I doubt he gets fired, especially with all the injured players he's had to deal with. Rockets also had a great regular season that exceeded expectations. If they were going to fire him, they would have done it at the end of last season"
ZombieLincoln666,So is CP3 hopped up on xanax? 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; what's your opinion on that occurring?

I think it is really chill"
ZombieLincoln666,He defeated baldness
ZombieLincoln666,Nope
ZombieLincoln666,Except for the Warriors playing far better teams
ZombieLincoln666,"https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/599575559832743936

I'll just let Lowe do the talking for me then."
ZombieLincoln666,it reflects a players stats though
ZombieLincoln666,he's most famous for his rapping 
ZombieLincoln666,I always hear this from other Canadians. What's the deal?
ZombieLincoln666,"..which is why I said neither out-dueled anyone.

It's like people here don't read past the first sentence of anything. Jesus."
ZombieLincoln666,you sound like you're 15
ZombieLincoln666,Draymond
ZombieLincoln666,"Grizzlies seem to have the game in the bag, but all it takes is a few 3's, and GSW is due for some"
ZombieLincoln666,Apparently Kyrie is a better passer than LeBron
ZombieLincoln666,They weren't supposed to beat the Spurs 'on paper' though. Austin Rivers and Barnes played well above usual. 
ZombieLincoln666,I guess we should believe everything he says
ZombieLincoln666,"It was reported that they ran through the concussion evalution tests twice for Steph, and according to your own link, once for Klay. 

So how can you possibly say they have ""completely disregarded the concussion protocols""? "
ZombieLincoln666,I find this game to be really aggravating to watch. Both team's offense is pretty bad
ZombieLincoln666,Jerry Buss died in 2013
ZombieLincoln666,deadspin is ON IT
ZombieLincoln666,"It isn't 8 days or nothing. Injuries don't work like that. He supposedly injured it in game 2 against Boston, but we've only started really noticing it affecting him these last two games. So it seems like he is aggravating it by playing on it."
ZombieLincoln666,and he's 5-18 right now
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; And yet people complain about only one of these player's efficiency... 

Yeah, the one who is known as a 'pure scorer'

"
ZombieLincoln666,Those are all fair points. But you have to also acknowledge how much more experience that team had in the Finals and playing with each other.
ZombieLincoln666,"I didn't endorse, did I?

I'm just saying how it could be interpreted by people."
ZombieLincoln666,Crawford just won this. maybe should have lost it with that travel..
ZombieLincoln666,I'm convinced someone's got an IFTTT plugin or something that uploads highlights automatically
ZombieLincoln666,"This season, Curry has absolutely been better than LeBron"
ZombieLincoln666,"you kind of sound like an ass now, don't you?

actually you always did."
ZombieLincoln666,so the cavs don't have time to score after..
ZombieLincoln666,Because Taj's foot is hooked around Delly's. Watch the video and look at their feet carefully.
ZombieLincoln666,TT's rebounding is huge for the Cavs right ow
ZombieLincoln666,Whatever team has the balls to bench him
ZombieLincoln666,sick comment
ZombieLincoln666,His jumpshot is retarded. They don't need that right now
ZombieLincoln666,"Knicks honestly, if we really want to talk about bottom tier. They have Melo coming back and tons of cap space"
ZombieLincoln666,Based on a single half of basketball?
ZombieLincoln666,There is also a giant picture of his face in between them
ZombieLincoln666,brave of you to come here and say LeBron is good
ZombieLincoln666,"I think it is just a push back against all the praise he gets from the general public. i.e. being voted into the all-star game last season despite playing only 6 games. 

And then there was all the outrage when ESPN ranked him 40th at the beginning of the season, which turned out to be accurate."
ZombieLincoln666,Like Kevin Love saying he felt fine and could play the first game against Chicago
ZombieLincoln666,It will teach you the offensive systems used by people like Scott Brooks and Mark Jackson
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;literally have zero effect

"
ZombieLincoln666,Maybe the higher prices filter out people who aren't dying to go to the games?
ZombieLincoln666,Because that's what our job is
ZombieLincoln666,Just because they're Spanish doesn't mean they're ignorant
ZombieLincoln666,capable? yes of course
ZombieLincoln666,lol you probably heard 2 people say that. relax.
ZombieLincoln666,Is Conley crying blood?
ZombieLincoln666,i said nothing about web traffic you dingus
ZombieLincoln666,"It's called male pattern baldness, and it isn't weird at all"
ZombieLincoln666,I saw the Grizzlies make quite a few jumpers against GSW
ZombieLincoln666,x-rays/radiologists aren't perfect at diagnosing things
ZombieLincoln666,WTF Tony Brothers..
ZombieLincoln666,Will Curry sit out in the 4th? lol
ZombieLincoln666,going to the finals is better than not going to the finals
ZombieLincoln666,"Korver easily

ZombieLincoln666,"I was actually responding to someone nitpicking me, you dunce. But congrats on knowing that metaphors are a type of figurative language. "
ZombieLincoln666,That doesn't make sense
ZombieLincoln666,He has a 'sleeper' body
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm pretty surprised this many people are picking the Cavs. 
GSW just had a historically good season, and the Cavs are injured."
ZombieLincoln666,[joke about ESPN]
ZombieLincoln666,It looks like that bison has a large basketball tumor growing on it's back

ZombieLincoln666,drink lots of fluids
ZombieLincoln666,Poor shooting efficiency is not a minor flaw. This Cavs team should have wiped the floor with the Hawks last night.
ZombieLincoln666,The cavs organization seems completely tone deaf
ZombieLincoln666,he should be
ZombieLincoln666,"jah, break zeee wall's hand

ZombieLincoln666,and 5 turnovers. He almost turned it over on this pass too.
ZombieLincoln666,Did Terry seriously just step over Blake? What a fucking shit. Blake's reaction was perfect though
ZombieLincoln666,"naw, he wasn't."
ZombieLincoln666,"Presumably you would have linked to it, but it had tons of downvotes "
ZombieLincoln666,Rockets should be renamed Zombies because they refuse to die
ZombieLincoln666,Most definitely
ZombieLincoln666,It says he was the highest paid talent at the time of his contract in 2010. 
ZombieLincoln666,"Here is the team isolation play data from synergy:

Cavaliers lead the league in isolation plays. "
ZombieLincoln666,"I wonder if TT shouldn't have fell like that, assuming he was trying to draw a foul. He could have gotten the OREB."
ZombieLincoln666,For you? www.lakersnation.com
ZombieLincoln666,I feel like everyone forgot the Rockets are missing DMo and Beverly. 
ZombieLincoln666,DETROIT BAD BOYS
ZombieLincoln666,Probably the same people that voted Kobe into the all-star game this season
ZombieLincoln666,"If you bring it up in a thread about LeBron his army of fans downvotes it.

ZombieLincoln666,He must have a ton of confidence in his shooting. I have no idea what plan B would have been had he missed.
ZombieLincoln666,just like his play calling

ZombieLincoln666,nice
ZombieLincoln666,"There are a dozen better stats that show Steph Curry is good

The whole idea behind RPM is that it factors out contributions from teammates."
ZombieLincoln666,"They signed him to their biggest contract when he started working there, so I don't think so"
ZombieLincoln666,They would definitely be sitting Kyrie and Shump if the Cavs had a decent bench. They're both limping and look like they're in pain
ZombieLincoln666,sick maymay
ZombieLincoln666,Sometimes I forget Blake actually plays basketball
ZombieLincoln666,The simplest and best solution I've heard is that the team should be allowed to choose to take the ball out instead. 
ZombieLincoln666,i thought that was Bosh
ZombieLincoln666,"If Kevin Love was a better defender, he'd be amazing"
ZombieLincoln666,"""Jumpers are like pretty girls. I don't have one"""
ZombieLincoln666,Kevin Love disagrees
ZombieLincoln666,disrespectful to kobe
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;people said that he is incapable of playing well in the playoffs

Find me a quote that says this "
ZombieLincoln666,"Lots of people who said LeBron has been playing poorly got down voted, so I don't know what you're talking about. If anything people here are too obsessed with star players and refuse to acknowledge when they play poorly."
ZombieLincoln666,"defensive win shares is supposed to correct for that, for what it's worth.

It shouldn't be *that* surprising that he is last for players who played over 2000 minutes, since the reason most rookies don't get many minutes is because they tend to be serious defensive liabilities. Wiggins will improve a lot defensively over his next few seasons."
ZombieLincoln666,Barnes has been playing damn good 
ZombieLincoln666,The only *obvious* flaw in his game is that he doesn't handle traps very well.

ZombieLincoln666,"They are based on combining box score stats to form a catch all metric to judge a player. By doing that it throws out lots of the nuance and multicollinearity in basketball. Something like RPM is far better IMO.

PER attempts to account for defense by only looking at rebounding, blocks, and steals. That means it fails to measure defense accurately, and because it is combined with offense, it can't be used to measure offense accurately either.

ZombieLincoln666,"Just because I have a Piston's flair doesn't mean I can't criticize another team or player. That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps you think my flair implies I think the Pistons are an amazing team. Maybe that's why you picked your flair (e.g. bandwagoner). That isn't why I picked mine."
ZombieLincoln666,GSW should not be happy about this win. The amount of stupid turnovers I saw was pathetic
ZombieLincoln666,Jimmy Butler is so good
ZombieLincoln666,He knew he had it dialed in
ZombieLincoln666,oh okay. Except Noah clearly got a piece of Lebron's
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;The report also declared two other plays of interest as correct non-calls. Kyle Korver cleanly stripped the ball away from Pierce with 20.6 seconds remaining

I thought this too. People were saying Pierce got ""mauled"" but that just wasn't the case on the replay. At worst Korver hit Pierce's forearms. Pierce just flopped hard on it."
ZombieLincoln666,A lot of those turnovers are from botched passes
ZombieLincoln666,"Because it includes contributions from teammates. 

As a hypothetical, if you had a starting lineup that consisted of Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Shaq, Tim Duncan, and a 50 year old Joe Schmoe from the YMCA, Joe Schmoe would have a high BPM compared to most other players in the league, but lower than the four players on his starting lineup."
ZombieLincoln666,"Consider that he was only a 12 ppg player this year in the regular season. His job is primarily to provided extremely good floor spacing and to force defenses to plan around him. The fact that his 3P% dropping from 43 to 38% is sort of irrelevant since the Hawks aren't actually getting many buckets out of him anyways (not directly, that is..)"
ZombieLincoln666,DRPM is the best overall defensive stat available
ZombieLincoln666,Oh god yeah. I've seen Clippers and Rockets fans argue over who is the most hated
ZombieLincoln666,"great block by Wall, even greater recovery by Harford"

Please show me this.

The Heat actually ran offensive schemes. This Cavs team doesn't really do that. It is all LeBron high pick-and-roll with tons of iso. In fact, the Cavs in game 1 against the Hawks had the most iso plays of any team in the entire season. GSW v.s. Cavs will look like an extreme version of last years finals."
ZombieLincoln666,They should be called the San Antonio Zombies
ZombieLincoln666,"I didn't deny Delly didn't do it on purpose. He did. 

Taj hooks himself around Delly when he kicks him (or whatever you prefer to call it)"
ZombieLincoln666,god damn it ESPN show pissed off Kevin McHale.. you can't announce he's furious and then not show it
ZombieLincoln666,Did Curry just air ball?!!
ZombieLincoln666,Depends who else is on my team
ZombieLincoln666,"""Pussy!"" 

[see's ref]

 "".. you're Pushing!"""
ZombieLincoln666,I think his run as a head coach is over. He hasn't coached a team in 8 years
ZombieLincoln666,I'm not sure he is still in his prime. He is still great of course.
ZombieLincoln666,"He has a championship, and for the last 8 years has a 67% win record, which is fantastic. He also seems to know what he's doing as a coach.

As a GM it might be a different story. "
ZombieLincoln666,"I can do it with one word:

Kobe"
ZombieLincoln666,Damn Ariza fucked up Klay real good
ZombieLincoln666,"I remember reading that some friend of his put that in his contract. 

they obviously knew Iverson's spending habits pretty well"
ZombieLincoln666,wow GSW is ice cold
ZombieLincoln666,diklis4chiklis
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; So you're telling me people didn't guard Korver that closely in the reg. season...? Gtfo. Korver had a historically hot start but he has calmed down post all star break. 

no, that isn't what I'm saying...


"
ZombieLincoln666,wtf sort of foul was that on Delly?
ZombieLincoln666,"of course you are, Lieutenant_Taco_Fart"
ZombieLincoln666,"Hawks Warriors

I'm tired of hearing people treat the Hawks like they stand no chance against the Cavs, despite being a better team right now on paper and during the regular season."
ZombieLincoln666,"yeah, we know who Kyrie Irving is..."
ZombieLincoln666,"That doesn't change anything what I said. If you want to argue that LeBron will likely be better next season, fine. 

But Curry has obviously been better this season, and especially this postseason. He won the MVP and LeBron didn't for this reason. It would take someone who either hasn't watched basketball this season or a blind fanboy to say otherwise. And there are apparently quite a few of those here."
ZombieLincoln666,"lol, literally everyone is already saying this. we get it..."
ZombieLincoln666,Turns out that benching your heavily injured and hobbled players is actually a smart idea
ZombieLincoln666,"That's why Jeff Van Gundy transferred from Yale to a school that would have him on their basketball team. It's kind of bullshit, but that's how it goes."
ZombieLincoln666,HIV rates are high in DC
ZombieLincoln666,"Oh, so then I guess he is just showing off his hand exercises then? lol"
ZombieLincoln666,The Detroit Tigers
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; I dislike the Clippers because they do seem to complain more than other teams, though the popular narrative could certainly be warping my perception. 

It's definitely true. In an interview Redick even acknowledged it"
ZombieLincoln666,The first rule is no girls allowed
ZombieLincoln666,That's actually a really good idea
ZombieLincoln666,"That's not okay. 

Can't say I'm that shocked though."
ZombieLincoln666,"Dwight Howard

it's funny how many e-badasses there are here who call him soft "
ZombieLincoln666,He closed his legs. It's not like he had him in a wrestling move
ZombieLincoln666,"I don't think the series would competitive even if the Cavs were healthy. Love is good and all, but he doesn't make a ""huge"" difference. His box plus/minus is only 1.9 this season, down from 8.4 from last year."
ZombieLincoln666,"Tim Duncan is amazing.. but I feel like Karl Malone is routinely being left out of the conversation. Probably for the sole reason that he never won a championship, but there are so many factors that are out of a players control when it comes to those. "
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Hydrox

what a weird name for a cookie. It sounds like Hydroxide "
ZombieLincoln666,It's too dangerous for WWE
ZombieLincoln666,It often seems like he's better at shooting contested threes than wide open ones
ZombieLincoln666,How much the 4th quarter collapse was from being exhausted due to lack of a decent bench?
ZombieLincoln666,the Celtics got swept tho
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; They're basically tied in likability

so what you're telling me is that /r/nba doesn't love Curry a lot more than Lebron"
ZombieLincoln666,Did that Heat team have 2 of their 3 star players injured? 
ZombieLincoln666,"His body and state of mind seem to be back, even if the numbers don't always reflect it"
ZombieLincoln666,GSW seems so small compared to the Rockets
ZombieLincoln666,"The biggest reason is that Magic won championships. 
"
ZombieLincoln666,Yeah but also keep in mind that 1.1 pts/possession is for the regular season. It will be lower in the playoffs because the competition is tougher and defenses try harder. 
ZombieLincoln666,"When you are in charge of a billion dollar organization, then feel free to have trashy PR. "
ZombieLincoln666,Not a fan of Shaq with them. He just lacks chemistry
ZombieLincoln666,Bulls shit the bed though. It's not clear the same will happen to the Wizards or Hawks
ZombieLincoln666,I wasn't remotely criticizing him for having a high usage. You are extremely defensive about LeBron and there's no point in talking to you. 
ZombieLincoln666,"I don't believe you

lol"
ZombieLincoln666,The thread on how good LeBron would be if played in flip-flops was great
ZombieLincoln666,C-Webb is great as the color commentator 
ZombieLincoln666,"I hate and like specific things about each team. 

I just hate the Clippers constant whining to the refs. That's about it. I love Blake Griffin both on and off court. CP3 is one of the best point guards of all time. I think Redick was one of the most underrated players in the league this season. Jamal Crawford has amazing handles and can be really fun to watch. And DJ is a god damn beast.

For the Rockets, I also like Dwight's personality. He seems like a fun guy to be around. The notion that he's soft is largely from salty Lakers fans who are shocked that someone would leave their team. Plus he got SVG fired which was great for the Pistons ;). And McHale is one of the least hate-able coaches in the league. 

But Harden's playstyle is not always entertaining, even if it is effective. Pat Bev seems like a villain. Jason Terry flashes gang signs pretty often, which is pretty trashy. And seeing Josh Smith play better does hurt a little. It's like he didn't a shit when he was with the Pistons. And I have to say, in my experience, Rockets fans are the one's most likely to call you ""gay"" as an insult.  "
ZombieLincoln666,you *could* argue that. you'd be very wrong though
ZombieLincoln666,And in every LeBron thread there are comments saying how good LeBron is.
ZombieLincoln666,Although it helps when LeBron is shooting threes at 15.6%
ZombieLincoln666,such a classic
ZombieLincoln666,are you 13 or something?
ZombieLincoln666,Whats it like being a big piece of shit?
ZombieLincoln666,Everyone knows Delly is the glue
ZombieLincoln666,dude not cool. that hurts
ZombieLincoln666,How is this not him winning? I haven't heard a single person criticizing LeBron for doing this. Most of the blame has been on Blatt for drawing up that play in the first place. From the interview with JR it actually sounds like Blatt just had a brain fart and changed his mind when people questioned it.
ZombieLincoln666,I don't know how TT didn't get hurt on that fall. That looked gnarly 
ZombieLincoln666,"Why completely ignore efficiency?

A GM wouldn't do that, and neither should you"
ZombieLincoln666,It's a geometrical glitch basically. The court isn't wide enough
ZombieLincoln666,fucking dunk fest
ZombieLincoln666,that shit isn't going to work against GSW.
ZombieLincoln666,classy rockets fan fingerblaster69
ZombieLincoln666,"Draymond Green. Going by his on/off court numbers, he has been their most important player this playoffs:

http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612744/onoffcourt/?sort=PLUS_MINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Per48

and he is third for the regular season, with Thompson 4th. "
ZombieLincoln666,"Bulls have one of the largest fanbases, so not at all"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; The Cavs aren't that bad of a team, this is by far his most talented team in his Cavalier career, even without Love.

No way. His some of his previous Cavs teams were very solid defensively. "
ZombieLincoln666,/r/nba is just pretty downvote prone in general
ZombieLincoln666,I'm skeptical of a slideshow with no information on where they got that number.
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Cavs are already a top defense

Not in the regular season"
ZombieLincoln666,"damn, he's literally been going for the throat"
ZombieLincoln666,That assist to turnover ratio still isn't good. 
ZombieLincoln666,"no

this might go down as one of the worst shitposts ever though"
ZombieLincoln666,Lloyd =/= Windhorst
ZombieLincoln666,"Rswany literally said 

&gt;They're basically tied in likability

Maybe logic works differently in Australia.
"
ZombieLincoln666,more field goals made than attempted?
ZombieLincoln666,"""Kevin, the results of your drug test came back. Congrats, it's dank"""
ZombieLincoln666,He prefers handwriting letters 
ZombieLincoln666,Do we actually know he gets paid millions?
ZombieLincoln666,It's mostly just useful for comparing players on the same team.
ZombieLincoln666,right
ZombieLincoln666,Rockets answer every time..
ZombieLincoln666,Brian Windhorst HATES this video
ZombieLincoln666,First time NBA coach being put on a massive stage.. can't say I'm shocked
ZombieLincoln666,"While you're right about LeBron's FT% not being the greatest, I don't follow your reasoning going from that to saying that this means he is not statistically a GOAT level player.. especially if you compare him to players like Kobe who is by all accounts a less efficient scorer overall even accounting for his higher FT%.

&gt;I'm thinking in terms of advanced stats like Win Shares per 48, Offensive Win Shares and Player Efficiency Rating. 

So the three shittiest advance metrics?"
ZombieLincoln666,thanks for being honest
ZombieLincoln666,That's sort of irrelevant. The team was built around Dwight. 
ZombieLincoln666,can they speed the clock up?
ZombieLincoln666,It always comes down to this..
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; these two things aren't really related, these teams have played the best in the playoffs regardless of what they did in the regular season

the fuck is ""regardless"" supposed mean in this context? Obviously the regular season games don't affect the playoffs, but basic inductive reasoning would suggest that the teams that perform well in the regular season are the best teams, and thus they are likely to perform well in the playoffs.

Christ some people on /r/nba are thick."
ZombieLincoln666,GSW can't seem to string together more than 6 points without fucking up
ZombieLincoln666,There was obviously a kick. Delly's leg flew sideways
ZombieLincoln666,I'm not disagreeing. But he's a rookie and usually rookies don't play many minutes because they are defensive liabilities. Wiggins will surely improve over the next few years.
ZombieLincoln666,yeah that 16% from three is fucking BEAST
ZombieLincoln666,It's so fun watching referees watch basketball on a monitor screen
ZombieLincoln666,That's like.. fairly reasonable 
ZombieLincoln666,That's not exactly a binding contract
ZombieLincoln666,"Don't forget 16% from three, and a TS% of 50%, which has him tied with Josh Smith.

If he plays like that against GSW the Cavs will be swept. 
"
ZombieLincoln666,Seriously? Have you seen the KD's?
ZombieLincoln666,"I mean, he is shooting 16% from 3.."
ZombieLincoln666,"Better than just making shit up and ignoring all evidence to the contrary.

here are the assists per game of teams in the playoffs: http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/?sort=AST&amp;dir=1

Cavs are second to last. All of this supports my claim.

People seem to think I am being critical of Blatt... I get that he does other things in coaching and he should be commended for it. But why pretend he runs all sorts of offensive sets when that isn't the case?"
ZombieLincoln666,Something about Aussie basketball players just piss people off.
ZombieLincoln666,That was 2 weeks ago.
ZombieLincoln666,"He's not wrong though, I've seen multiple people say that LeBron and Cavs are going to destroy the Hawks here on /r/nba"
ZombieLincoln666,Jamal is a horrible defender. I'd take JR Smith
ZombieLincoln666,"You should bet money on the Cavs to win the finals then

good luck"
ZombieLincoln666,He only bumbed his ankle at the end of the game. 
ZombieLincoln666,1=1
ZombieLincoln666,I'm not seeing it.
ZombieLincoln666,and life is rigged
ZombieLincoln666,"HGH

"
ZombieLincoln666,how are you a bulls fan
ZombieLincoln666,I'd argue the opposite. Karl Malone was clearly a big part of Stockton's ridiculous assist numbers. It's not like Malone wasn't doing work to get those baskets
ZombieLincoln666,"Don't be so hyperbolic. Karl Malone was really fucking good at basketball, and was a bigger offensive force than Duncan. He has more career win shares and value over replacement, a higher TS%, and higher PPG. 

So yeah, you could conceivably say Malone was better. You can disagree with it like a reasonable person though."
ZombieLincoln666,"That's odd because I keep hearing over and over on /r/nba that ""regular season means nothing"" because the bulls lost to the heat etc."
ZombieLincoln666,💤
ZombieLincoln666,/r/cringe
ZombieLincoln666,he's a true two way player
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; and took a lot of contested threes. 

Not true under SVG"
ZombieLincoln666,SN17 with another passive aggressive post criticizing LeBron
ZombieLincoln666,yeah but thy lord our father is watching over us and will protect your rib ~ MJax
ZombieLincoln666,Hawks are now missing Korver
ZombieLincoln666,Oh no
ZombieLincoln666,"That's a good point, but what ultimately matters is what opposing teams  are willing to risk, and he has shown he is capable of being a decent free throw shooter, even post injury."
ZombieLincoln666,"who is it, your annoying mom or something?"
ZombieLincoln666,"lol, that ""leg lock"" did not warrant the reaction Taj gave. "
ZombieLincoln666,Both Carroll and Horford were injured.
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron needs to defer to Kyrie more. 4/14 is not good
ZombieLincoln666,"The thing his, I sort of like reading him just shit on people."
ZombieLincoln666,I said it was a demonstration of *why people think that*.
ZombieLincoln666,hey Lebron finally made jumper
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; I was referring solely to TV

Why? lol. You can't just pick out one thing like that."
ZombieLincoln666,If the owners had that financial philosophy they probably wouldn't be billionaires 
ZombieLincoln666,queue defensive cavs fans
ZombieLincoln666,why would they put that in the game? that shits embarassing..
ZombieLincoln666,because the officials fucked up
ZombieLincoln666,"I was replying to ""all year""

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dellama01.html

whatever, cavs fans will fucking downvote everything negative about their team, even if it is factually true."
ZombieLincoln666,Turnovers have been a problem for LeBron this season
ZombieLincoln666,There is a clip I once saw of him on the Spurs draining a shot and then just furiously yelling something at the opposition. It was crazy seeing it come from a tiny white man.
ZombieLincoln666,"Rather than look at rebounds per game and then trying to adjust subjectively with minutes played and rebounds available, why not just use TRB% (the percentage of rebounds available that a player grabs)?

[on the bottom look at playoffs advance](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;y1=2015&amp;p1=greendr01&amp;y2=2015&amp;p2=thomptr01&amp;p3=&amp;p4=&amp;p5=&amp;p6=)

TT and Draymond are neck-and-neck in rebounding in the playoffs. "
ZombieLincoln666,Taj could have just waited two seconds. Instead his dumb ass kicked his way out of it.
ZombieLincoln666,"He's actually pretty good on offense. He certainly isn't 'very bad'.

He hasn't done much this year because he isn't getting minutes."
ZombieLincoln666,"and as I said, neither out-dueled anyone. 

LeBron is not incapable of playing poorly. Sorry."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Steph just a better shooter.

that's sort of an important part of basketball..."
ZombieLincoln666,He now has a massive ice pack on his shoulder
ZombieLincoln666,"LeBron practiced his jump shot early for the last game and it didn't work at all, so maybe this will help"
ZombieLincoln666,"well there are more people in general, so no"
ZombieLincoln666,"I think the Reggie Jackson comparison is good

although I'm not fully convinced Reggie is a quality starting point guard yet"
ZombieLincoln666,GSW would be favored even with K Love and fully healthy Kyrie
ZombieLincoln666,He was 5/20 in game 5 against the bucks which is even worse
ZombieLincoln666,Congrats to GSW on winning the finals
ZombieLincoln666,Lee was shooting 46% in the playoffs
ZombieLincoln666,being white probably doesn't hurt
ZombieLincoln666,"Is he actually getting fouled? 

It's not out of the realm of possibility that he simply isn't getting fouled (or maybe I should say, obviously fouled).
"
ZombieLincoln666,"His regular season 3p% still affects the playoff games because defenders have to respect it and guard him closely, which opens up the floor for his teammates.

But okay, Beal got dem buckets."
ZombieLincoln666,then what?
ZombieLincoln666,"Look at his stats and tell me how you've come to that conclusion

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html

Look at his advance stats. They follow the standard shape of an NBA player who has had their prime in their mid twenties. I don't want it to be true either, but all evidence points to yes. He can still be a top 5 player in the league and past his prime FYI"
ZombieLincoln666,"Hawes was like, ""fuck it, why not?"" "
ZombieLincoln666,I've also heard weed cures cancer and give you super human powers
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron has been pretty bad this game. 6-21 with 7 turnovers.
ZombieLincoln666,Doubt it
ZombieLincoln666,and you have magical powers that allows you to tell if a player has an injury despite not showing any symptoms of it. Great.
ZombieLincoln666,"In 5 or so years you'll know.

Until then, shut the fuck up"
ZombieLincoln666,That was 2 weeks ago..
ZombieLincoln666,uhhh yeah isn't Dolan the owner? lol
ZombieLincoln666,There is really isn't an equivalent in English. You just have to hear it from someone that speaks German.
ZombieLincoln666,don't forget those ridiculous grizzlies jerseys 
ZombieLincoln666,"Where?

Some cavs fans are super defensive..."
ZombieLincoln666,I love the grin on his face. He's so happy about it
ZombieLincoln666,"Shaq

bye."
ZombieLincoln666,The thunder better watch out
ZombieLincoln666,opposed to metaphorically not being true?
ZombieLincoln666,tbh this game is more interesting than your shit comments
ZombieLincoln666,you can actually lose the next two games
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;  Numbers don't lie.

Except for Korver's of course"
ZombieLincoln666,MAMA MIA
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah I pretty assumed he wasn't because he's white, tbh"
ZombieLincoln666,that's my favorite Stevie Wonder lyric
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; People aren't babies about it though. Or passive aggressive.

From the guy who called me a ""moron"" and a ""fucking idiot"" on the internet, that's pretty rich"
ZombieLincoln666,"We aren't talking about Curry's offense. We are talking about Lee's offense. jesus christ. And for what it's worth, Curry has been ineffective himself this series."
ZombieLincoln666,if you say so
ZombieLincoln666,"that's just a synonym, brah"
ZombieLincoln666,I thought Beal's been guarding Korver all series?
ZombieLincoln666,"I mean, Popovich has punched his players to get them riled up. Carlisle is clearly an asshole. SVG is constantly upset. Doc too. I think sometimes players need that sort of thing."
ZombieLincoln666,"Not just better, but the best. "
ZombieLincoln666,A lot of people hate his playstyle because they think it is an unreliable way to score. This video is a perfect demonstration of why
ZombieLincoln666,yeah I ignored your dumbshit post because it was pointless. sorry.
ZombieLincoln666,Have you seen what KD's Nike shoe looks like?
ZombieLincoln666,"That's more on the Bulls than anything else.

Kyrie is limping out there. He should probably sit if he wants to help them."
ZombieLincoln666,It's probably all the cunts who used to be Lakers fans. 
ZombieLincoln666,He'll be throwin out C-notes when the league catches word
ZombieLincoln666,"Who yells ""fuck"" really loud?"
ZombieLincoln666,so brave going after such a cherished idol here on /r/nba
ZombieLincoln666,naw
ZombieLincoln666,kobe is still with the lakers
ZombieLincoln666,Someone needs to slap Curry. The dude is in a catatonic state 
ZombieLincoln666,"based on what?

From what I've seen the opposite seems to be true. They pull players if they have head injuries and then perform concussion tests if needed."
ZombieLincoln666,"Say the same thing about Rose's shot yesterday, and get down voted."
ZombieLincoln666,That explains why he comes off the bench
ZombieLincoln666,come on.. this is easy
ZombieLincoln666,Not many people have talked about Horford's injured shooting hand
ZombieLincoln666,What if a player has had an injury on their shooting arm/hand that makes that difficult?
ZombieLincoln666,You can do that without someone locking their legs around you. Watch the video and look at their feet. Taj's foot his hooked around Delly's when he kicks. Delly isn't locking his legs around Taj and it is obvious.
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah, probably.

That isn't to say Ibaka is better overall than Love of course. Love is also the best outlet passer in the league"
ZombieLincoln666,my favorite part is when his mouth opens a little
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Right, because one possession where he doesn't score clearly demonstrates it's unreliable /s

Are you unfamiliar with the concept of an example?

No one is denying he was good in the regular season. The criticism is that during playoffs defenses play much smarter and refs are more careful with their foul calling

"
ZombieLincoln666,wow a little defensive are we? 
ZombieLincoln666,Or how about athlete flashing obvious gang signs = obvious gang signs.  lol. You can clearly see what they are..
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron would thrive in that era against the Bad Boy Pistons. He is more physically dominant than Jordan. He often seems impervious to fouling. 
ZombieLincoln666,"why are so many people calling Draymond Green ""Green""? I didn't hear anyone do that in the regular season"
ZombieLincoln666,Bill lied
ZombieLincoln666,"Eh, better than Cavs fans throwing shit at players. "
ZombieLincoln666,"A sweep would be shocking to say the least. The Rockets are a good team. Also, refs won't let it happen"
ZombieLincoln666,"And Steve Nash was a much better shooter than Stockton was. Nash was one of the most efficient scorers of all time even.

They're both excellent passers. I don't think you can really say one is better than the other, especially not using career assist totals"
ZombieLincoln666,i wonder if iguodala broke his collar bone
ZombieLincoln666,"LeBron had 7 turnovers, and shot for 32%. 

but yeah, neither really out-dueled anyone"
ZombieLincoln666,"So Ballmer's a cocaine addict, right?"
ZombieLincoln666,Depends how much weight you want to put on this season versus career stats.
ZombieLincoln666,A lot of that is because he is leading the league in usage in the playoffs
ZombieLincoln666,curry with the shart
ZombieLincoln666,[exclusive picture](http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40256000/jpg/_40256105_man_blocks_tank_238.jpg)
ZombieLincoln666,He did push Dwight. It just didn't do anything to him
ZombieLincoln666,If his arm is extended. People push off all the time with their elbows.
ZombieLincoln666,GSW turnovers
ZombieLincoln666,No banked three is ever on purpose. 
ZombieLincoln666,Blake used his power ups too soon
ZombieLincoln666,"So am I, and I disagree"
ZombieLincoln666,"a video? with Chris Hayes?

I'll take it"
ZombieLincoln666,Pratt sans neck
ZombieLincoln666,Can someone please.... find Ja Rule!
ZombieLincoln666,LMAO You posted this 2 hours after he deleted his comments...
ZombieLincoln666,Wow that's rare
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;  The Cavs deserve more respect

They get plenty of respect. "
ZombieLincoln666,How is it making a joke of domestic violence?
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm not sure what you're asking, but the values Hollinger gives are also pts/100 possession, e.g. OFF EFF = ORtg

I couldn't find team playoff ORtg on basketball-reference. I could find a season total number, and they are slightly higher than what Hollinger gives"
ZombieLincoln666,on 35% shooting. Knicks lose
ZombieLincoln666,"Holy hell, that is some intense HDR

Seriously, what is it with people doing this to pictures of NBA players? It looks like ass 
"
ZombieLincoln666,"You said 'in terms of play', not 'in terms of narrative'"
ZombieLincoln666,You gotta be kidding me...
ZombieLincoln666,Why the fuck would you want to compare two dissimilar situations? That completely defeats the purpose.
ZombieLincoln666,"The fuck is going on

play basketball"
ZombieLincoln666,"Been a redditor for 2 days, and probably a cavs fan for even less."
ZombieLincoln666,he's high on HGH
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Considering the price of med schools these days, there's a reason doctors work for ever. Those juicy student loans

Those poor doctors"
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah I was wondering that. At first I thought he was yelling at the ref, but he was definitely mad at Mozgov."
ZombieLincoln666,The person I originally responded to did.
ZombieLincoln666,"No, NBA front offices are not as reactionary as reddit is"
ZombieLincoln666,It's not like Chicago will continue to shoot 3's at 75%..
ZombieLincoln666,I didn't see it on ESPN
ZombieLincoln666,"Grizzlies have 7 times as many FT attempts than GSW. I'm not saying that necessarily means the refs are favoring them, but it certainly looks that way"
ZombieLincoln666,alright Austin.. slow your roll
ZombieLincoln666,That's why his ORPM is really high
ZombieLincoln666,"True, but literally no team has beat the Warriors if they've gone down by 15 points, and this Grizzlies team is the last I'd predict to break that trend because of their slow pace."
ZombieLincoln666,"They played most of the regular season without him, so this isn't a new obstacle "
ZombieLincoln666,so there isn't time left for the cavs to score.
ZombieLincoln666,Detroit was mediocre in large part because of him. It wasn't like our team fucked his jump shot up. 
ZombieLincoln666,"synced to Disturbed's 'down with the sickness', please"
ZombieLincoln666,"What the hell else would it mean?
"
ZombieLincoln666,But he obviously thought Delly was clamping his leg or else he wouldn't have kicked (or whatever you prefer to call it). Instead he should have fallen on the ground to make the refs notice what Delly was doing 
ZombieLincoln666,kobuh bryunt
ZombieLincoln666,Have Cavs led yet?
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm not bashing the Cavs dude, I'm just stating the type of offense they run (and getting downvoted because of it). Cavs fans are super fucking sensitive about anything that seems like slight. It's ridiculous..."
ZombieLincoln666,"Apparently LeBron will have a ""cake walk"""
ZombieLincoln666,Jesus christ with the turnovers..
ZombieLincoln666,I worry about his back tbh
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; You wrote a shit story

How do you know Wittman is correct and the reporter isn't?"
ZombieLincoln666,"Uh oh, McHale's been teaching Dwight some post moves"
ZombieLincoln666,jah jah
ZombieLincoln666,I thought the title was going to be an exaggeration 
ZombieLincoln666,"He only averaged 1.3 threes per game under SVG.

He took a lot of midrange shots though. "
ZombieLincoln666,Sometimes people have similar opinions. What a travesty
ZombieLincoln666,"It would have likely ended any career he could possibly have FOREVER



"
ZombieLincoln666,I thought Griffin was just a commercial actor?
ZombieLincoln666,"Good defense from Beal and bad luck. He's had off shooting nights during the regular season too.

It isn't all from defense since he took a lot of contested 3's during the regular season as well.

I think recency bias is part of this too. Curry also went cold for part of this post season."
ZombieLincoln666,I feel like this makes it worse.
ZombieLincoln666,This was the worst game I've seen from Korver
ZombieLincoln666,I hate hearing him as a commentator talking about Kerr and GSW. It's so awkward and uncomfortable. 
ZombieLincoln666,He's not trying to create controversy though. It's accidental. It's not like he threw out the play that had him inbounding the ball because he wanted to fuck with Blatt
ZombieLincoln666,I think it's a lot more likely than people want to acknowledge.
ZombieLincoln666,The Bulls basically gave up
ZombieLincoln666,are you unfamiliar with that term?
ZombieLincoln666,He doesn't shoot the ball every time he touches it dude...
ZombieLincoln666,He had that look on his face like he knew his achilles tendon at snapped. 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; 13 games can be just a bad stretch

It obviously is. But when you say ""small sample size"", that implies this is just statistical noise. It doesn't appear to be. Now that doesn't imply he will continue shooting at 16% for the rest of his career."
ZombieLincoln666,or cheap and lame
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Not even LeBron hijacked this sub this way. 

lol. Alright, then next time you're in a relevant thread, post a comment saying you think Curry was better than LeBron this season. "
ZombieLincoln666,Warriors in 5
ZombieLincoln666,I don't know... Harden does have that '72 virgins' beard
ZombieLincoln666,LEBRON HAS KIDS
ZombieLincoln666,It's a fact that missing 0/10 of your first shots is a negative. Sorry.
ZombieLincoln666,I had no idea he was a Cavs fan
ZombieLincoln666,so bradley gets handicap points or something?
ZombieLincoln666,Klay should stop shooting
ZombieLincoln666,A lot of sixers fans keep denying it though. I believe the previous source was some notorious reporter that shits on the 76ers. Is this the same dude?
ZombieLincoln666,"If you watch his eyes, he gets sad for a second"
ZombieLincoln666,Diaw touched it first for sure
ZombieLincoln666,"That still isn't a leg lock, even if the announcer called it that.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leglock

He is closing his legs on Taj's. Hardly worth Taj's retaliation IMO"
ZombieLincoln666,"Curry isn't going to shoot at 29% again for the whole series. 

But if you're so confident, bet a bunch of money on the Cavs. good luck."
ZombieLincoln666,You read random mark twain quotes in 6th grade? cool
ZombieLincoln666,I'd rather watch LeBron miss shots than watch that overrated show
ZombieLincoln666,So many shit posts since the playoffs started.
ZombieLincoln666,Mozgov HATES yoga
ZombieLincoln666,I'm not sure slashing is the ultimate old man game
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; WHAT A FREAKING WARRIOR.

you mean Grizzly"
ZombieLincoln666,"the most important aspect

when a PG can't shoot they end up like Rondo"
ZombieLincoln666,That Josh Smith is a worthless player 
ZombieLincoln666,joke answer
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm always bothered by the lack of error estimates when people cite SportsVU. If it can only detect speed with 3 mph accuracy, it's harder to make this type of conclusion"
ZombieLincoln666,"37 points on 37 shots isn't good, and LeBron would be the first to tell you that."
ZombieLincoln666,Better than paying Lance to play on your own
ZombieLincoln666,Not to mention Delly fell because Taj shoved him
ZombieLincoln666,It also helps when you have Tristan Thompson and Mozgov grabbing offensive rebounds like mad men
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah, I've heard about LeBron being good"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; I don't really think it would have been a big deal at all.

I don't think so either, but it is pretty obvious how others might"
ZombieLincoln666,I can't do better. That doesn't excuse them
ZombieLincoln666,clippers looked gassed
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;I still don't understand why people think he's leaving

How is that possible? I get that you think he's staying, but it should be obvious why he would leave."
ZombieLincoln666,ball don't lie
ZombieLincoln666,anuhhhlyze
ZombieLincoln666,"Box +/- is a pretty weak stat. See for example:

ZombieLincoln666,Noah isn't a Lakers fan
ZombieLincoln666,that was the joke
ZombieLincoln666,Can LeBron?
ZombieLincoln666,Or they gave him a stupid contract because they're stupid?
ZombieLincoln666,It's ironic because I've heard Canadians give us (Americans) shit because of our race issues.
ZombieLincoln666,I feel bad for the Rockets actually. They deserved to win this one. 
ZombieLincoln666,prepare for ... gang signs
ZombieLincoln666,"I wonder if the widely held belief that Thibs will be fired is the reason they opened up a coaching position. They maybe think that Williams is just an average coach and easily replaceable, and that this is their rare opportunity to try and get a coaching talent like Thibs"
ZombieLincoln666,how the fuck do people get downvoted for stating facts? ridiculous..
ZombieLincoln666,Oh my god
ZombieLincoln666,"Fuck, Redick take the shot"
ZombieLincoln666,You could pretty much guess the content of that
ZombieLincoln666,fall over and try to get a foul called on Delly
ZombieLincoln666,"In what way was it a 'lock'? 

Delly's legs weren't crossed or anything"
ZombieLincoln666,That probably would have been a bad idea. 
ZombieLincoln666,Josh Smith
ZombieLincoln666,brave of you to go after the media on /r/nba
ZombieLincoln666,"This Rockets team either gives up for a game, or just goes off and answers everything their opponents throw at them. It's sort of perplexing"
ZombieLincoln666,"They're asking if it is a good investment, so I guess the assumption is that they'd make some degree of their money back."
ZombieLincoln666,Basically everything Barkley was saying has been true this series.
ZombieLincoln666,"On the other hand, I constantly see people in denial about players exiting their primes. It isn't really reactionary when historically, players decline when they exit their twenties."
ZombieLincoln666,Do you even know what a loaded question is? because that wasn't one at all..
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; but in my opinion this year seems closer than normal. 

GSW has had a historically good season, so this can't be true.
Not to mention the Kevin Love injury and the Spurs just getting eliminated"
ZombieLincoln666,The Clippers clearly aren't looking like they're trying to eliminate them this game
ZombieLincoln666,lebron threw his ass in jail
ZombieLincoln666,/r/sixers
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; due to my situation

huh? dude r u dolan?"
ZombieLincoln666,"A legitimate argument would be showing a player's FG% in clutch time. 
People would do that, except it is almost always lower than normal because the shots are harder. "
ZombieLincoln666,so do his knees
ZombieLincoln666,"I mean, he was on the bench with them May 6 for a home game as a sign of respect. "
ZombieLincoln666,"there is a reason you aren't allowed to hit opponents in the back of the head in professional boxing

he is for certain heavily concussed. "
ZombieLincoln666,not to mention a few of those games were horrible up until the buzzer beater
ZombieLincoln666,finally GSW takes a decent lead. Its felt like the Rockets have been trailing by 5 for ever.
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; He picked up a player option costing himself millions because the Magic front office bribed him with candy. At age 26. 

You'd have to be really fucking stupid to actually believe that."
ZombieLincoln666,Kerr has basically said as much
ZombieLincoln666,"I literally read someone say playing against the Hawks is ""gonna feel like a cake walk"" for LeBron"
ZombieLincoln666,No one is that good at guarding Harden. Redick has done as a good a job as anyone I've seen.
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah, he's only shooting 3's at 44.4% ..."
ZombieLincoln666,Australians really piss people off apparently
ZombieLincoln666,I just don't see how he can play this series... He had major reconstructive surgery recently and probably had a concussion as well.
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; So just your average duke student then? besides the whole bball thing

Hate to break it to everyone, but the average Duke student is Chinese and cares more about soccer"
ZombieLincoln666,I'd feel real bad for CP3
ZombieLincoln666,"another Korver essay.. 

I've seen like 4-5 of these things"
ZombieLincoln666,"The Duke boys are eatin 

Dunleavy too"
ZombieLincoln666,what the fuck
ZombieLincoln666,looks about right
ZombieLincoln666,And he hasn't even been shooting as well as he usually does
ZombieLincoln666,Taj should have taken a fall. This is exactly the situation in which you should embellish to get a foul (rightly) called. 
ZombieLincoln666,"he blood, apparently"
ZombieLincoln666,Looks like its a bad ankle sprain
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; A hornets fan says the exact same fucking thing and has 10 upvotes to /u/helpwanted1 's -5.

ZombieLincoln666,"He's averaging 4 turnovers a game this season, with 7.4 assists. 

I fail to see how that is better than CP3 who averages 2.3 turnovers with 10.2 assists."
ZombieLincoln666,So what? Lebron is especially good at it.

His brother died of brain cancer when he was five, he's been shot in the leg, and has battled through a rare liver disease to become a starter on a playoffs team. All that, and one awkward landing takes him out of the series.

Meanwhile, JR Smith breaks a Cavs record. It's bullshit.

ZombieLincoln666,It's entirely your bench

ZombieLincoln666,Paul is easily better than Rose this playoffs
ZombieLincoln666,oh shit
ZombieLincoln666,"A great many of Stockton's assists were when he would pass to Malone in the post, and Malone would score 10 seconds later."
ZombieLincoln666,"Yeah you could, but it would be pretty weak argument imo. That Pistons team was like the Hawks in a way in terms of lacking a traditional superstar. This thread's title should have said ""team whose best player is a superstar PG""

But if I was going to pick a best player and that team, it's gotta be 4 time DPOY Ben Wallace "
ZombieLincoln666,You can't just look at win/loss record and conclude that they were 'as good as the warriors'. Point differentials could still be completely different. It also says nothing about how they match up with each other.

ZombieLincoln666,I will shit my pants if Clips come back
ZombieLincoln666,true
ZombieLincoln666,Weren't there rumors that he had stress fractures in his foot?
ZombieLincoln666,I doubt it. His haters would bring up all the injuries that other teams had.
ZombieLincoln666,Actually he isn't. Korver is a better defender and a better rebounder.
ZombieLincoln666,"Well I do, especially when that player has lots of turnovers already"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; “He’s not looking to murder Dell Curry to get to Sonya Curry, but instead married Ayesha Curry because she is similar to his Sonya.”

lol, they look nothing alike apart from being attractive and black."
ZombieLincoln666,I feel like ppl have been overrating him in the playoffs. He hasn't been particularly efficient. 
ZombieLincoln666,I guess you did miss all the turnovers then.
ZombieLincoln666,they actually banned you? They talk so much trash there
ZombieLincoln666,"and don't forget ""skills challenge champion"" Patrick Beverly"
ZombieLincoln666,"Bulls should win due to their health. Shump and Kyrie were limping out there. And Rose has started getting to the line more.

But then again, LeBron might start hitting his jump shots."
ZombieLincoln666,"Turnovers - stemming from not always the tightest handle. He sometimes tries to make flashy passes that are risky. This season a lot of it has been from adjusting to the new team.

Free throw shooting - It's average. Can always get better.

Defense - He's a fantastic defender when he tries. Sometimes he gets lazy on the defensive end. It's hard not to be when you are basically doing everything on offense."
ZombieLincoln666,"The way the Grizzlies would win, I would think, is by preventing a lead that large to begin with.

I think they lack the scoring pace to come back. We'll see"
ZombieLincoln666,"absolutely yes. 

They keep aggravating his injuries. A healthy Kyrie against GSW would be huge for them."
ZombieLincoln666,when he wants to be
ZombieLincoln666,That's not far off from what most basketball players believe...
ZombieLincoln666,"You sure? According to Holinger's team stats GSW is averaging 1.074 points per possession this postseason. That of course includes the Pelicans series, and the Pelicans were ranked 22nd in defensive efficiency this season (the Rockets were 6th)

http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/seasontype/3


In the regular season they averaged 1.097 points per possession. http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats

"
ZombieLincoln666,But that is perfect for the Cavs. They don't use Love's post game at all. He often just camps out at the corners and comes in to grab rebounds
ZombieLincoln666,Mozgov is frustrating to watch on offense sometimes..
ZombieLincoln666,"Why? No one is trying to predict what might happen in the future based on these 7 minutes. It being a ""small sample size"" is irrelevant, since it isn't being treated like a sample at all.

It's no different than saying that Blake Griffin played well last game. "
ZombieLincoln666,that's cute
ZombieLincoln666,"Doc - ""alright pass the ball to my boy"""
ZombieLincoln666,he came in like a wrecking ball
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron played like shit this game. A lot of people have a hard time admitting this apparently. 
ZombieLincoln666,Redick is surprisingly good at defending Harden
ZombieLincoln666,OH FUCK
ZombieLincoln666,He'll probably just chill with his family. 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;This is usually done by huge MJ was &gt; than LJ people.

WTF does this mean?"
ZombieLincoln666,"He said in the context of the Cavs Hawks series, so the injuries are entirely relevant."
ZombieLincoln666,"hey look, the rockets missed a three."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; “Yeah, they used to f--- each other up,” said Tristan Thompson, "
ZombieLincoln666,paq-a-shaq
ZombieLincoln666,"Look at their stats and tell me that again. Curry has been far more efficient a scorer. He is less turnover prone than LeBron. His defense has also been good and has some of the most steals per game of any player. About the only thing I can think of that LeBron has beat him in is rebounding.

And why are you implying that LeBron is better in the postseason? He hasn't been remotely as good as Curry. I seriously wonder if you've actually watched a game other than game 6 against the Bulls. He's been shooting 3's at 15% and turning the ball over a ton."
ZombieLincoln666,Morey out-GM'd Doc
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; including the all-time assist leader.

Karl Malone is responsible for quite a few of those. Stockton would pass it to him in the post and get an assist 10 seconds later. Trying to claim that his teammates were the cause of his success is moronic.

&gt;Having clearly bad games when your team needs you most also looks bad. It's a black mark that his career will always carry.

It's like a handful of games over 18 years. It's just dumb to denigrate someone's career because of it from a statistics standpoint."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; that's what pushing off means

No 

Here is what the rule book says: 

&gt;A player shall not hold, push, charge into, impede the progress of an opponent **by extending** a hand, arm, leg or knee

That means you can legally push off up to the subjective point when your arm is extended. 

"
ZombieLincoln666,"maybe the dumbest thing i've read all day. ATL beat the Cavs 3/4 times in the regular season. 

And the one game they beat ATL is when they shot 13% from 3 and Cavs shot 61% (their season high), which implies a fluke."
ZombieLincoln666,The only thing I can gather from this series is that whoever wins the west will win the finals.
ZombieLincoln666,I hate listening to Mark Jackson. It's so awkward hearing him talk about GSW now.
ZombieLincoln666,Only because it isn't a play at all
ZombieLincoln666,thanks
ZombieLincoln666,GSW has some bad nerves or something. 
ZombieLincoln666,Because that perfectly describes him
ZombieLincoln666,I'm surprised ESPN is still playing that failure of a song from will.i.am. It is so obviously terrible.
ZombieLincoln666,They still owe you guys one
ZombieLincoln666,I'm picturing Perkins giving Delly a piggyback ride
ZombieLincoln666,He has a killer mentality without a body to match.
ZombieLincoln666,I don't think he meant to completely destroy it
ZombieLincoln666,"They bring in millions of dollars to the owners, so they shouldn't act like they've been done a favor. He essentially spent a season doing a favor for the NCAA."
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm hoping they both lose, if that's possible"
ZombieLincoln666,What makes Stockton better than Nash?
ZombieLincoln666,"Sure, and you can say that is why he is better. 

That doesn't mean ""there's just no conceivable way you could say he [Malone] was better than Duncan"". 

But fuck nuance I guess. Tim Duncan is the best and there is no possible way anyone could ever make a claim otherwise."
ZombieLincoln666,It's surprising that the MVP is selling signature shoes? Really?
ZombieLincoln666,"like a fraction of a second after I posted it, and certainly before anyone replied to it.
It doesn't even matter. 38% &gt; 32%"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; It's very smart

Really? It's like the most obvious thing"
ZombieLincoln666,"..so I gave you other justifications

and point guards don't do much defensively other than steals so it actually isn't a bad justification at all."
ZombieLincoln666,the Warriors have had a historically good season..
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; and everyone on here was saying he won't ever be the same

no"
ZombieLincoln666,Im basing it on the number of subscribers to the Bulls subreddit
ZombieLincoln666,"yeah, a 2 seed beating a 1 seed. Such a massive upset. "
ZombieLincoln666,"There is an obvious answer and you've basically said it. Bogut's 52% is for this season only, and he's only been averaging 0.6 free throws a game. 

His career average FT% is 56%, which is likely a far more reliable estimate. That means that when he goes to the line he will average 1.122 points, which is more than what GSW averages per possession, 1.097

ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Are you sure you're not thinking of normal plus-minus?

no, I definitely mixed them up."
ZombieLincoln666,"It might be rational but that doesn't make it ethical

you can seriously fuck someone up doing that."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Thank god, hopefully this rest makes him not look like an 80 year old hobbling up and down the court

He injured his foot during the Boston series, had 8 days of rest, and still didn't heal fully. So I'm somewhat skeptical that this will be different."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; His offense and set plays are a breath of fresh air and beautiful to watch, especially considering the team is stacked with people that can very easily slump into hero-ball style of play.

The opposite is true. This Cavs team relies on hero ball constantly and runs very few offensive sets at all. I have no idea what team you've been watching.

ZombieLincoln666,They probably wouldn't be leading the postseason in defense
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Kobe would have thought about how to make the Clippers even more miserable.

Kobe to Clippers confirmed."
ZombieLincoln666,at least I am a person
ZombieLincoln666,"Lebron? seriously?

This playoffs he has a TS% of 49.9%. The league average is around 54%. And last postseason his TS% was 66.8%, to put it in perspective.

He has been shooting 3's at an abysmal **15.6%**. That is worse than what Josh Smith shot for with the Pistons (and he is shooting more of them). 

He is averaging 5 turnovers a game, the most in the eastern conference."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; one really trashy club that everyone goes to.

Is it? I thought it was pretty common knowledge that he is a great defender"
ZombieLincoln666,"Kerr has done a great job, but imagine if they had hired Budenholzer back in 2011 instead of Mark Jackson."
ZombieLincoln666,"He's as good of a defender against Harden as I've seen

Part of that is of course not being overly aggressive  "
ZombieLincoln666,Yeah but that is always true about analyzing sports. I guess you'd rather he not use any footage at all in his analysis? It's nothing more than backing up arguments with evidence. 
ZombieLincoln666,He did supposedly get spat on
ZombieLincoln666,"It's pretty widely known that Thibs and the Bull's front office have animus towards one another, and that he will likely be fired after this postseason. I wonder if this has affected his coaching"
ZombieLincoln666,124098001 Yuan
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;  It feels like 3 years ago already. 

no, no it doesn't."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't even allowed to use the widely recognized term ""hipster"", you really disproved my point there haha.

I put that *after* my rebuttal specifically so you wouldn't say something like this. So much for that.

&gt; Also, you have decided that box-scores shouldn't be used, yet you say RPM is much better which itself uses box-scores.

No, I meant that they shouldn't be the **only** things that are used. That is the problem with PER

&gt;Okay, but you know that multicollinearity is more of a problem with +/- or on/off stats right? 

who gives a shit about +/- ?

&gt;And RPM uses ridge regression to combat multicollinearity, do you honestly think this is the most stable tool you have at your disposal?

It's better than nothing if you want to make a catch all stat. 

&gt;You say that rebounding, blocks, and steals (and the defensive rating which you failed to mention, which is really just an on/off stat which is what you were recommending a few minutes ago) are bad proxies for defense, okay, but again all these things are used in RPM. You know what else is used? FG% even height. So yeah, if you're taller, lucky you, get a better DPM. 

PER doesn't have a ""defensive rating"". And again, RPM doesn't just rely on box score stats like PER.
"
ZombieLincoln666,You actually think that is a real Cavs fan?
ZombieLincoln666,People here said the same thing about the media rumors that Thibs would be fired. 
ZombieLincoln666,Probably two different people
ZombieLincoln666,they swishing everything
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; You guys are delusional as fuck

Haven't you heard? They're going to win the finals, Blatt is actually in charge of their offense, and Kevin Love is for sure staying. So literally the opposite of what every reporter has said."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Why does it make the Cavs worse because they played easier(ish) teams?

you don't even need to consider what teams they played to see that the Warriors are a far better team. There is reason every single book maker in Vegas has the Warriors winning.

then how come:

ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; And I enlightened you

So in addition to being a dunce, you're also conceited? Congrats"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;I, and pretty sure most people, didn't interpret the first comment as condescending, just as a ""woah, pump the brakes, Thibs is still coach.""

Okay, then it is a condescending way of saying that.

Why can't we speculate about destinations for Thibs when there is a preponderance of evidence that management wants him gone?

Bulls management fired Ron Adams, one of the best assistant coaches in the league, a couple of years ago. And is despite helping the Bulls have winning seasons (he is now doing pretty well with GSW). "

ZombieLincoln666,"I kind of respect that Shump didn't just insult him, and just said that he didn't like him and here is the reason why"

Sure, but that is almost never the case."
ZombieLincoln666,sure
ZombieLincoln666,So Courtney Lee is shooting 3's at 46% this playoffs

ZombieLincoln666,Lee's been great
ZombieLincoln666,"It's hard, but LeBron should not be shooting three's at 15.4% while taking 5 a game. That is unacceptable and he knows it."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Delly locked his legs around Taj though

That's an exaggeration. He just closed his legs while lying face down, and Taj's leg was in the middle. He probably did it on purpose, but it wasn't as egregious as people are making it out to be.

I could easily see how refs would think that was just incidental.

"
ZombieLincoln666,"There is luck in all aspects of basketball. It is just more obvious when you have an actual lottery. 

Where I disagree with the author's argument most is that they seem to think the biggest factor that is determined by luck in Hinkie's plan is his chance of getting the picks he wants. 

The part where luck really comes in is whether those draft picks turn out to be good or not. The top 10 draft picks are a wash it often seems like. The paragon that Hinkie is following are Sam Presti and OKC who have been very successful in the draft. But let's be honest, Presti has been extremely lucky."

ZombieLincoln666,It looked like Jones even got a bit of that shot

ZombieLincoln666,because it's super badass and cool
ZombieLincoln666,Tanking doesn't involve poorly coaching.
ZombieLincoln666,"No. He called the NFL commissioner a liar, and acted like he was entitled to not pay any consequences for it. He's also been very critical of other people on the network. In general he just didn't act like he was an employee for ESPN."

The point is that it's not a remotely unpopular thing to think"
ZombieLincoln666,"yeah, your girlfriend's friends"
ZombieLincoln666,They didn't want a turnover with time left.
ZombieLincoln666,"First of all, this subreddit is not underrating the Cavs. [There was a poll here asking people who would win](http://strawpoll.me/4484070/r). Cavs take 37% of the votes. That simply is not underrating them if you compare it to the Vegas odds.

The reasons you give for why you think the Cavs will win are pretty tenuous. Yeah, the Cavs won a single game against GSW when Curry shot 28%. You really think that says much about a 7 game series? It isn't even the same Cavs team because K Love isn't playing, and Kyrie won't be 100%.

The Warriors aren't favored because the West is stronger. They are favored because they have a better team. Could the Cavs win it? Sure. But let's not pretend that is likely. For Christ's sakes, Dellavedova is the 7th best player on their team. This honestly feels like the Spurs v.s. Heat last Finals, with the same people saying 'never bet against LeBron'"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; They had a 3-1 lead. This is on the players imo

Having a good bench makes the players play better. "
ZombieLincoln666,"I don't personally think Kevin Love is leaving, but I'm tired of people here acting like it is some grave offense to speculate. The Cav's front office is certainly speculating, as they should be. 

It would not be shocking if he left. He is averaging 10 less points per game than with Minny. That is a bigger drop off than what Bosh experienced. And on top of that, Kevin Love doesn't strike me as someone who loves defense, which makes the point drop off more important. He was being used as basically a spot up shooter. I seriously doubt that is what he expected."
ZombieLincoln666,Hawks have looked better recently
ZombieLincoln666,"Depends who you ask. 

Lots of people who like stats and analytics already think he is better. 

Also the question of who has a greater career is different than who is better."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;While Jackson excelled as a leader, he was not interested in the minutiae of coaching, according to sources. He so rarely watched film that the video team eventually stopped loading clips onto his laptop. He didn’t draw up plays during huddles, or carry a clipboard. He often looked at his cellphone during practice, even when management was around. His relationship with the front office grew more strained.

He is at the bottom of his team in those categories.

His rebounding numbers are high, but that is in part because of all the bricking that has been going on in the games they've played from either team.

LeBron is an amazing player etc., but people need to stop kidding themselves about how he is playing this playoffs. His saving grace is that his competition hasn't really capitalized on it."

"
ZombieLincoln666,they're such trash over there
ZombieLincoln666,I think it is more that he knows how to walk that fine line. He's so strong that he doesn't need much to keep a defender off him.
ZombieLincoln666,He's a Jew from Massachusetts 
ZombieLincoln666,Do you work for Nike or something?
ZombieLincoln666,How does it not look good for them? The Cavs haven't been playing well. Their highest scorer last game was Matthew Dellavedova.. 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Regardless, it's silly to point out the 16% from 3.

No, it's perfectly reasonable to. "
ZombieLincoln666,"I'm glad they didn't go for a super serious version of Ben Franklin, which is what teams seem to be doing now (hornets, bucks, grizzlies). It's nice to see a nice cartoon playing basketball again"
ZombieLincoln666,"He's taken 36 shot attempts, so he hasn't really been scoring well."
ZombieLincoln666,IT LITERALLY MEANS NOTHING
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; He's averaging about 10 dimes per game this playoffs.

No, he's averaging about 8, with 4.6 turnovers per game."
ZombieLincoln666,what does unstoppable mean? Unblockable? Some shots are hard to block (like hook shots) but are low percentage anyways. 
ZombieLincoln666,paintball is so damn fun 
ZombieLincoln666,"Hawks have no Thabo, no Korver, and injured DeMarre, and now no Horford. "
ZombieLincoln666,"Did you watch them in previous years? He simply isn't a bad offensive player. He isn't the best fit for the current GSW, which is obvious since he isn't playing. That doesn't make him a bad offensive player."
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;  I said Barkley and Inside the NBA is more watched because they attract the casual fans.

What does ""more watched"" even mean in the context of Bill Simmon's entire output? lol. "
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron in the entire playoffs: 10 for 62 from 3
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Watch the games for once and you'll see Westbrook is clearly a better defender.

I actually do watch the games, and Westbrook is not ""clearly a better defender"" by ANY stretch of the imagination."
ZombieLincoln666,knicks fans pay that much money to go to knicks games
ZombieLincoln666,It was even contested
ZombieLincoln666,blake griffin is acting harder than in those kia commercials 
ZombieLincoln666,I think he was actually just responding to LeBron
ZombieLincoln666,"Hawks

they're underdogs who have a shot at winning it all"
ZombieLincoln666,"it isn't some generally true statement... Without K Love and JR, they are missing shots more and need the rebounding more"
ZombieLincoln666,Bill Simmons is one of the most widely read sports writers in history. I doubt Barkley could do what Simmons does. Saying that Simmons can't compare to Barkley on TV and then ignoring all the stuff that Simmons does is an unfair comparison
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;I know their bench is weak, but on paper they seem to be an elite team.

I don't understand. If their bench is weak, then how do they look like an elite team on paper? 

It's their bench. That was the problem."
ZombieLincoln666,"extremely well timed

that's what separates mediocre defenders from great ones"
ZombieLincoln666,"DMC, when he gives a shit"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Means absolutely nothing

You can draw inferences about how teams will play against each other and how good teams are in general. It isn't perfect, but to say it 'means absolutely nothing' is asinine. 

But maybe you think it is just a coincidence that the 4 teams left had the highest seeds coming into the playoffs. "
ZombieLincoln666,Curry is on a different planet in terms of scoring efficiently. 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Pop had splitter on Wade starting games.

I heard that Wade was once asked about this and he said he was shocked how often defenses respect his 3 point shot. "
ZombieLincoln666,fuck off with that passive aggressive persecution complex bullshit
ZombieLincoln666,or irresponsible. Although maybe you're from the Thibodeau school of thought
ZombieLincoln666,You've reached that conclusion how?
ZombieLincoln666,"lol. GSW is a great defensive team, but Curry is pretty important to their offense"
ZombieLincoln666,More on Curry's mom plz
ZombieLincoln666,"I love that bait move by Delly, it totally worked"
ZombieLincoln666,"Maybe he's just stretching his sore hand? 

He definitely threw up some blood gang signs and you can see him mutter ""big B's bitch""
"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;And quality of defense goes beyond statistics.

that was my point"
ZombieLincoln666,because it isn't a stupid argument
ZombieLincoln666,"did you start watching basketball this season

edit: do people seriously not remember the cramp from last finals? It was pretty widely talked about"
ZombieLincoln666,"lol, so many shitposts during the playoffs."
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron has gone lone-wolf plenty of times. He just had the most iso-heavy game of the entire season against the hawks in Game 1
ZombieLincoln666,"In the next 30 years, they might"
ZombieLincoln666,"No, he has been going heavy iso this playoffs"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Stockton is widely considered the 2nd best PG ever even though he never won a ring. 

Is that true though?"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;  Kobe has been on more all nba first teams, same with defensive teams

It's pretty much universally agreed upon by people with decent knowledge of the sport that Kobe did not deserve several of those all-defense selections later in his career."
ZombieLincoln666,part of that is LeBron's had maybe the largest shooting slump of his career this playoffs
ZombieLincoln666,"+/- is such a bad stat. I mean, how can you seriously think LeBron had a negative impact with 38 points on 24 shots, 0 turnovers, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 blocks?"
ZombieLincoln666,"so he thinks LeBron is not good, but is still underrated. Okay."
ZombieLincoln666,"I actually like harden, but fuck all those defensive Rockets fans who would say shit like ""oh, i thought harden was bad in the playoffs??"" after games when he played well."
ZombieLincoln666,THE FANS
ZombieLincoln666,"10/62 isn't great, period."
ZombieLincoln666,Pistons
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron's not their primary concern right now
ZombieLincoln666,I actually think LeBron is a top 5 player of all time. Maybe you should try stalking harder next time.
ZombieLincoln666,I was so scared when I saw Bogut going for a pass
ZombieLincoln666,wait.. how is he not on the first team? He's the best rim protector in the league
ZombieLincoln666,"Where did I say Jordan was inefficient?

LeBron is more efficient. His highest TS% for a season is 65%. Jordan's is 61.4%. And LeBron's career average is higher too (so far) - and that's with him entering the league at 19."
ZombieLincoln666,Do players factor in shooting percentages when talking about what matchup is toughest?
ZombieLincoln666,"If the refs call it the way they did game 6 against the Grizzlies, I'd say the Rockets (with Harden averaging 20 FTs a game)"
ZombieLincoln666,except for high fives
ZombieLincoln666,marketing opportunity..
ZombieLincoln666,"Okay, how about he has a higher DRPM than Chris Paul this season? What more evidence do you want? 

Even if CP3 is actually a better defender, it is clearly a marginal difference that doesn't outweigh how much better Curry is at shooting."
ZombieLincoln666,Makes sense. Hitler also killed himself when the going got tough
ZombieLincoln666,"Odd joke, considering [Wiggins was one of the worst defenders this season] (http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;year_min=2015&amp;year_max=2015&amp;franch_id=&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;shoot_hand=&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;birth_country=&amp;birth_state=&amp;college_id=&amp;is_active=&amp;debut_yr_nba_start=&amp;debut_yr_nba_end=&amp;debut_yr_aba_start=&amp;debut_yr_aba_end=&amp;is_hof=&amp;is_as=&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=&amp;award=&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=2000&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;c5stat=&amp;c5comp=gt&amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;c6stat=&amp;order_by=dws&amp;order_by_asc=Y)"
ZombieLincoln666,"Utah Jazz

It's hilarious "
ZombieLincoln666,"""it literally means absolutely nothing and it isn't particularly close"""
ZombieLincoln666,"People were even saying Lee was bad at offense, which is factually untrue"
ZombieLincoln666,This one isn't nearly as creepy
ZombieLincoln666,Blake had a nice counter trip on Terry
ZombieLincoln666,darude - sandstorm
ZombieLincoln666,It's nice to see a Cavs fan without an irrational love for LeBron
ZombieLincoln666,Are you Mark Jackson's girl?
ZombieLincoln666,Josh Smith was horrible on the Pistons. This game doesn't change that fact. 
ZombieLincoln666,"well, he is from chicago"
ZombieLincoln666,Not that surprised about Clippers and Rockets
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;He's been amazing on the offensive end

His TS% is only 50%, which is below average. I don't see how he has been 'amazing'.

A lot of people might argue that refs are not sending him to the line enough though."
ZombieLincoln666,He has been really fucking good this playoffs on the offensive end.
ZombieLincoln666,Or at least Rockets fans love to think it is
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Pretty much everything besides 3-pt shooting.

and 2-pt shooting. and free throw shooting. and rebounding. and defense."
ZombieLincoln666,stupid foul by Klay. fell right for the bait
ZombieLincoln666,I hate Jason Terry's head
ZombieLincoln666,Just because you're a fucker doesn't mean you're not an NBA player
ZombieLincoln666,"lol, there is still an entire quarter left. This hack-a-whoever shit will not be allowed next season"
ZombieLincoln666,"basic critical thinking would suggest the more 3's a player shoots, the more important that stat is."
ZombieLincoln666,I don't think you can be routinely called underrated and still be underrated
ZombieLincoln666,That was before he injured his elbow. He now avoids free throws and only takes like 0.6 of them a game.
ZombieLincoln666,The dumbest part of that argument is that people completely ignore the fact that it would also make modern players better defenders.
ZombieLincoln666,Literally no team has ever came back from 3-0. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that GSW will go to the finals. Sorry if it hurts your feelings.
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Anyway, even with all of Simmons' stuff, he still doesn't get as much viewership as Inside the NBA does.

He runs an entire website.."
ZombieLincoln666,"Way too complicated.

An easy and good solution would be to make it an option to take the ball out instead of free throws if fouled. "
ZombieLincoln666,"His defense hasn't been terrific
"
ZombieLincoln666,"Will 2009 Dwight's defense matter that much? Overall this postseason GSW hasn't been relying on jump shooting as much as they normally do, but now that the Splash bros appear to have his shot going again, that may not be the case against Houston. If so, Dwight's excellent defense in the paint is not nearly as important.

In terms of making an offensive contribution, Bogut is probably the best rim protector in the league right now and would limit Dwight's abilities on that end."
ZombieLincoln666,"Thabo ""Mayweather"" Sefolosha"
ZombieLincoln666,LeBron is also better at scoring. Kobe has never been particularly efficient. 
ZombieLincoln666,Okay Freud. He was probably just trying to have fun with it.
ZombieLincoln666,the refs
ZombieLincoln666,You've been a user here for a month. You probably didn't even watch the regular season.
ZombieLincoln666,The numbers do not back your statement up at all.
ZombieLincoln666,It's because Korver is a much much better 3p shooter and FT shooter. Those differences in efficiency are huge. Korver is far more valuable.
ZombieLincoln666,Wizards shooting is completely cold. I'm surprised they're still taking jump shots at all
ZombieLincoln666,wow
ZombieLincoln666,Atlanta was better defensively in the regular season
ZombieLincoln666,how is ESPN still playing this horrible will.i.am song
ZombieLincoln666,Jeremy Lin
ZombieLincoln666,the guy is a roller coaster of emotion. I love it
ZombieLincoln666,"CP3 is the reason they even made it past the first round. He should get a pass unless he plays poorly, which hasn't happened much in the post season so far.

Doc the GM should not get a pass, because he's built a team with a very poor bench"
ZombieLincoln666,yeah let's just ignore defense
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;but Jackson’s formidable public confidence and oratorical skill – which, says one team source, is what got him the job over then-Spurs-assistant Mike Budenholzer

wow they really fucked that up"
ZombieLincoln666,Stick a fork in them
ZombieLincoln666,Prigioni is such a pest
ZombieLincoln666,"You say that like it's a bad thing. TS% is the best stat for measuring scoring efficiency because it takes into account the fact that, for example, Korver's FT% is 10% higher than Beals. "
ZombieLincoln666,Kerr has some crazy life stories. Dad was killed by terrorists. He was punched in the face by MJ. He won an NBA championship 4 years in a row. And now he has the best record for a rookie head coach.
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;This is usually done by huge MJ was

"
ZombieLincoln666,How are there 8 minutes left still? This game is fucking over
ZombieLincoln666,"They'd be better. Wiggins developed faster than people thought and Love hasn't really been utilized well.

I thinks some Cavs fans have a hard time admitting that though"
ZombieLincoln666,"For a team that has shot as many as they have, it is fantastic. And it is the reason they're winning

For comparison, Curry (aka the greatest shooter ever) shot 3's at 44% this season"
ZombieLincoln666,were you missing Kevin Love then?
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; if i pick the warriors, i look like i don't watch a lot of basketball. what to do, what to do.

how so? Warriors are heavily favored to win it."
ZombieLincoln666,what an idiot
ZombieLincoln666,It's almost like he just wanted the cap space
ZombieLincoln666,"""I'll be sure to... uh... cross my tees"""
ZombieLincoln666,"I wrote that 5 days ago. lol.

&gt;The thread was asking who's the better overall player

Okay then why did you say:

&gt;But my post is about the playoffs only... And in their 3 games against each other, Beal has outplayed him which is a pretty huge reason why I ranked him ahead of Korver.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/35gmcg/how_do_you_rank_the_following_as_overall/cr48r2x


&gt;This is all from one thread lmfao

None of that changes what I said. "
ZombieLincoln666,ultimate gym rat
ZombieLincoln666,Having your players go iso all the time is one way to develop them I suppose.
ZombieLincoln666,"Whether or not you agree with the protest, I think we can all agree that having him there as a role model to show how to protest peacefully is a good thing."
ZombieLincoln666,give a Hail Hitler salute to Harden
ZombieLincoln666,"Because I was talking about this season, not this particular series. You never seemed to figure that out"
ZombieLincoln666,u r a hater kobe is da mamba killer intensity clutch competitiveness pure scorer 5 rangz 81 pointz 
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; He has gotten worse but people act like he's trash on defense and is hurting his team

Who acts like that?"
ZombieLincoln666,Do you have Asbergers or something?
ZombieLincoln666,Is he supposed to show the entire game or something? Analysts do this all the time. 
ZombieLincoln666,So this series is a better measure than the regular season? Okay dude.
ZombieLincoln666,"I swear, every ankle breaker posted here is either just a defender getting caught on a screen or slipping."
ZombieLincoln666,"Without curry, it is a competitive series against the Cavs. Otherwise the Warriors are heavily favored."
ZombieLincoln666,lol Jones knows no mercy
ZombieLincoln666,"Sure. I mean, Curry sometimes airballs 3's. "
ZombieLincoln666,"Nice show by the fans

If this was the Heat they'd have left after the first quarter"
ZombieLincoln666,"So in your opinion, defense is completely irrelevant?"
ZombieLincoln666,recency bias!
ZombieLincoln666,Noah's first field goal? Jesus
ZombieLincoln666,my gut tells me the rockets win this one..
ZombieLincoln666,oh shit you're right
ZombieLincoln666,God I was sure they're were about to miss that layup
ZombieLincoln666,you can't throw down someone in the air. That is not okay.
ZombieLincoln666,"Fuck analytics, Harden's midrange game is so wet."
ZombieLincoln666,"how do you get downvoted for saying the MVP is the best player this season? lol, fuck /r/nba.."
ZombieLincoln666,Not all of them simultaneously
ZombieLincoln666,Can't wait for Butler to leave for LA and Thibodeau to leave for Orlando 
ZombieLincoln666,Yeah. I'd say it represents their fan base accurately 
ZombieLincoln666,"Those are the FT's he makes. He is attempting less of them in the playoffs, with 10.2 FTA per game in regular season versus 9.8 in the playoffs. It's a small difference though. 
"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; and the regular season literally doesn't matter at all anymore. 

Why do so many people keep saying this? Obviously it doesn't affect these games, but you can make certain inferences and look at match ups and how these teams play together. "
ZombieLincoln666,"Bloods. He makes a big B, then a crip killer sign, then an east side sign.

In fact, in one of the first images that pops up when you search for John Wall is him making a gang sign: http://www.csnwashington.com/sites/csnwashington/files/wall_0.jpg

people probably think it is a celebration for hitting a three, but no, that is a ""b"" for bloods. "
ZombieLincoln666,"Then how is that ""so many""? "
ZombieLincoln666,whatever you have to tell yourself
ZombieLincoln666,I expect that ESPN will show that Klay head injury over and over
ZombieLincoln666,you know damn well that comment would get downvoted to hell
ZombieLincoln666,"That didn't stop Kyrie or Shump

although maybe it should have"
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt;Personally I would take Melo because he is a thousandfold times better than Kawhi at putting the ball in the basket and is a decent defender but that's just me.

By that reasoning, Kawhi is a million times better at defense than Melo"
ZombieLincoln666,"This doesn't mean white men can jump

it means Pat Connaughton is black"
ZombieLincoln666,Hawks are shitting the bed right now
ZombieLincoln666,beat your significant other
ZombieLincoln666,"I swear, leaving Curry wide open is the best defense"
ZombieLincoln666,"Kyrie may very well be hurting the Cavs by playing. Not only is he playing ineffective basketball, he is also making it more difficult for him to recover. Perhaps had he sat on the bench when he first got the injuries he would be recovered by now."
ZombieLincoln666,"That's true, but what I mean is that they aren't using Love to his fullest potential, which makes the tradeoff for his lack of defense worse. They could have gotten someone that could do Love's job for much cheaper"
ZombieLincoln666,wow did you come up with that all by yourself?
ZombieLincoln666,"Does the fact that in 2003 the first round was extended to a 7-game series from 5 games matter? 

From wikipedia:

&gt;The first round was extended to a best-of-seven series. This change arguably benefitted the higher seeds as it reduced the likelihood of an upset by a lower seed.

"
ZombieLincoln666,Rose to Wizards confirmed
ZombieLincoln666,"The Hawks struggled against the Nets, so not really"
ZombieLincoln666,You gotta strike when the iron's hot
ZombieLincoln666,"A comment that is only +6 and even explicitly calls Harden a great player is hardly evidence that people think he is ""trash"""
ZombieLincoln666,AD. He was also better in the playoffs. Griffin was really good though.
ZombieLincoln666,The refs should exercise some common sense in calling shooting fouls.
ZombieLincoln666,what the fuck is with this rockets team? They just go off so hard in spurts like this.
ZombieLincoln666,Everyone else in your list. And also DeMarre Carroll.
ZombieLincoln666,he has a cool name
ZombieLincoln666,"Is he though? Just because he handles the ball more doesn't make him more of a playmaker in my eyes. Korver is essential to the Hawks offense. This would explain why this season Korver is 12th in RPM: http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/RPM

(and Beal is 55th)"
ZombieLincoln666,"You said it ""feels"" like Lebron hasn't played well."
ZombieLincoln666,[Of course when Kobe trash talks to fans he gets praised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujuQheviI7U)
ZombieLincoln666,That last dude just looks the part perfectly
ZombieLincoln666,Harden's had a pretty good game quietly 
ZombieLincoln666,"lol, bullshit"
ZombieLincoln666,"healthier bench means healthier legs on the court, which leads to better jump shooting"
ZombieLincoln666,he said 'legitimate'
ZombieLincoln666,They won a lot of games. I don't see how losing a particular series is such a deciding factor. They lost twice in the finals to the GOAT. It isn't like a massive failure on their part.
ZombieLincoln666,"Blake was great, but I still think CP3 is the reason they made it past the first round. Blake had a very bad turnover that cost them a game in game 2 of that series."
ZombieLincoln666,"Does ""momentum"" last that long? lol. I've rarely heard it used like that"
ZombieLincoln666,Not compared to Shaq
ZombieLincoln666,hell no
ZombieLincoln666,SO RIGHT
ZombieLincoln666,"That 52.4% is from like 60 free throws this season. Although Bogut's free throw shooting went to shit after he had a terrible elbow injury, I don't think the Rockets should risk it. 

Although that being said, the Rockets are all about taking risks. I think if the Splash bros get really hot, they might try it."
ZombieLincoln666,He has the jaw for it
ZombieLincoln666,Bulls have one of the largest fan bases on /r/nba was my point
ZombieLincoln666,"I don't see Nene throw an elbow from the video, I just see him sticking out his elbows. I actually see DeMarre throw one

I wonder if DeMarre was being held by Nene's left hand. That would explain how badly he got stuck and also why he reacted the way he did."
ZombieLincoln666,they should rebuild Baltimore with all these bricks
ZombieLincoln666,The servers get overloaded daily. It's pathetic
ZombieLincoln666,Is it legal in the NBA?
ZombieLincoln666,Alright Skip
ZombieLincoln666,exactly the comment I expected
ZombieLincoln666,Isn't this more of a reminder about how freaking tall Calvin Johnson is?
ZombieLincoln666,Would good defense be equivalent to Mayweather's boxing style (which is... defense)?
ZombieLincoln666,"in terms of rankings, he's number one in our hearts"
ZombieLincoln666,maybe he hates his stupid mom?
ZombieLincoln666,"I'd say that's more because the Bulls shit the bed than because you guys played well. 

People keep bringing up LeBron.. and I'm getting the feeling most people here haven't actually been watching him. He's been well below his normal performance. He's turning the ball over 5 times a game, and shooting threes at an abysmal 15%."
ZombieLincoln666,"I don't, and I'm not making a claim either way, am I?"
ZombieLincoln666,He's been the best player in the playoffs tbh
ZombieLincoln666,"That means that the rest of the Bulls team were better defenders.
It doesn't necessarily follow that it means Korver is not good at defense. 
The Bulls are especially good at defense."
ZombieLincoln666,FUCK U LEBRAN IS THE BEST PLAYER ON EARTH
ZombieLincoln666,I thought the media and reporters were always full of shit and liars /r/nba?
ZombieLincoln666,He's doing it way less than last season
ZombieLincoln666,Anyone that athletic should become a good defender
ZombieLincoln666,Mozgov definitely bungled that screen
ZombieLincoln666,no its a stupid joke
ZombieLincoln666,Oh god
ZombieLincoln666,"&gt; Defending Handoffs Wiggins allowed .68 points per possession, and opponents shot 32.2%.

That says he's in the 22nd percentile which isn't ""damn good"". 

&gt;Defending off of screens opponents scored 1.04 points per possession and opponents shot 43.3% 

24th percentile... 

&gt;Post ups allowed .99 points per possession and 50%. 

26th percentile

so yeah you basically cherry picked before."
ZombieLincoln666,"The comment I replied to is far more condescending, which is just ironic because of how misinformed it actually is"
ZombieLincoln666,I can't even imagine JVG becoming a coach again
heat_forever,"Everything going over the backboard for the Cavs, they can't buy a shot."
heat_forever,His son shoots 94% from the free throw line
heat_forever,That's not the part that makes it offensive goaltending - it's the part where it's still intersecting the cylinder of the rim. It was sitting on the neck of the rim.
heat_forever,"Except they didn't blow it, Gibson committed 3 separate flagrants on Dellevedova. He didn't even get ejected for the kick, it was the brutal shoulder tackle right before that that put Dellevedova on the floor in the first place."
heat_forever,Karl Malone had a HOF player next to him for 18 years and couldn't win a ring. So apparently it takes more than that.
heat_forever,But they wouldn't have gone out to get them in the first place without varejao going down.
heat_forever,"""No way the Hawks go 4-23 from 3 again"" so they go 5-21, it's an improvement..."
heat_forever,"Spent some time analyzing their cap situation. I'm assuming the Cavs will look at a 4 year run coinciding with LeBron's prime finishing.

2016:

TT: He will sign a 0-6 year max under old TV deal. 4 years starting at 15M with 7.5% raises.

Iman: Getting 2.6M now, he'll want around $6M a year for 4 years.

Dellavedova: Getting 800k now, he'll want a payday - $3M a year for 4 years.

LeBron ($21M), Love ($16M), Miller ($3M) will most likely take their options. Matrix retires, other vets return on vet-mins. 

Team Option on Mozgov will be taken ($5M).

J.R. will most likely not take his option ($6M), and use this to get seriously paid as he's made himself into a critical player - look for him to ask for 4/40 to 4/48.

Varejao continues to make $10M as a backup to Mozgov.

Haywood goes away (freeing up $10M), maybe the Cavs make a move to get another very respectable bench player.

Some more aging vets will sign on as well.

So core will cost: around 105M with a projected tax line of about $80M in 2016. So a fairly significant 37.5M (25M over * 1.5) tax (no repeater violation). But not really a killer considering revenues.

2017:

Cap goes up to about 90M with estimated 110M tax line.

LeBron: 10+ year super-max under new TV deal starting 2017 season, potentially $32M+ first year cap hit, max of 4 years due to Early Bird restriction - GUARANTEED

Love: Will ask for a 6-9 year max for 4 years, $27M per year cap hit. I don't think the Cavs should give him this, but whatever, he'll ask and they will be forced to... maybe

Kyrie: currently under 0-6 year max under old TV deal. Great value for Cavs.

Varejao continues to make $10M as a backup to Mozgov.

TT, JR, Iman, Delly enjoy their fat paychecks with 7.5% raises.

Mozgov will demand a rim protector bonus - 3/45M at least. And he'll get it.

Mike Miller and Perkins retires. Some other vets will take their place.

So core will cost: 140M with a repeater tax violation (4-to-1) making their tax hit 120M... holy shit, you're right, there's no way they are paying this... If they don't keep Kevin Love, that's 113M with a repeater tax violation of 12M...

Cavs are gonna let Kevin Love go for sure in 2017."
heat_forever,Wild shot from Crawford but it goes
heat_forever,"He seemed like he was able to run, but it must be painful as fuck if he was crying about it."
heat_forever,"If ball doesn't hit the rim, it's a violation."
heat_forever,"Thibs? Family? Dude never went home from work, he has no wife, no kids, no family, his father died and he went back to work the day after the funeral like nothing happened - he's got nothing but basketball. It's his entire life."
heat_forever,"Norris Cole has the record for flattest Finals flat-top, he may be challenged by Iman Shumpert this year though."
heat_forever,"I think the culture of ""no layups ever"" is ruining basketball. If a man beats you, you got beat. You don't need to ""make him pay"" by injuring him. Too many coaches push this philosophy and they know exactly what they are asking for. But it's kosher to say ""play tough defense and don't allow layups"" when it's really code for ""if someone beats you, fuck them up"". "
heat_forever,"If you ask nicely, the Spurs will let you lick their championship trophy before they lose it."
heat_forever,I have a feeling all these moving screens will be called when it's against Cleveland.
heat_forever,"This postseason he's living the dream, shooting under 43% and getting to the Finals."
heat_forever,"I think he tore his ACL, broke his ankle and snapped his back in half during the Bulls series - but every time he just shook it off."
heat_forever,"He was idiot in 2013 when he made 6 different mistakes late in Game 6 and then pretty much threw in the towel in Game 7.

And countless times before that. And all throughout this series."
heat_forever,"Game 4 suspension as well. Might as well just go home, his season is done."
heat_forever,"Matt Winer about to get fired for Chuck's comments, lol"
heat_forever,It should be obvious to anyone the NBA doesn't want their 67 win MVP-winning darlings to lose an ABC prime time game... They are hedging for poor NBA Finals ratings which will probably be lowest in history if LeBron doesn't make it there.
heat_forever,Melo is going to make another $125M
heat_forever,He should wear shoes over his shoes so when he loses his shoe he's still got shoes.
heat_forever,Why did I even think for a second a Spurs fan would admit he was wrong... carry on.
heat_forever,y'all fucked up your mvp ballots
heat_forever,"Nothing bad about avoiding fouling out, but when you prioritize it so much your coach has to bench you the 4th quarter of a game 7... that's pretty bad."
heat_forever,"Nope, the rules now clearly state anticipatory shots should not get that call. It was clarified 2 or 3 years ago. No sane person would be taking a half court shot in that situation. I would have preferred a no call so that Manu would be tackled by Popovich at midcourt."
heat_forever,Autumn when the leaves are goldenrod.
heat_forever,It's quite likely Duncan and Ginobli won't decide until shortly before training camp whether they are coming back or not. Which means their cap-hold remains in place.
heat_forever,"Harden begged the basketball gods for one awesome game and they said ""Ok, but one day in the future, you will also have one of your worst games ever"" He just didn't expect it to be the next game."
heat_forever,"Shows how much you know, the Heat already retired Jordan's jersey in 2003. Do your homework next time, silly kid."
heat_forever,Starving kids in Africa don't sympathize with someone who gets $10 an hour for flipping burgers because he didn't get $15 an hour.
heat_forever,"I said he had a couple, which turned out to be 1 which turned out to be a planned tanking season to get Tim Duncan. Popovich is not used to losing and he won't stick around for a bunch of losers."
heat_forever,which is offensive goaltending
heat_forever,And the refs are gonna call a foul on the play too that they forgot to mention.
heat_forever,They should force the Rockets and Hawks to play each other in a loser's series before the Finals start.
heat_forever,"I don't think many modern day players really care that much about it. As long as the money is in the bank, rings are really more for the fans. 

DeAndre most likely prefers to take his money and relax with a longer offseason."
heat_forever,Cavs lost this one because they stopped playing around the end of the 3rd quarter.
heat_forever,He did
heat_forever,"What did you expect them to put out? 

""Yeah we totally didn't want to check Klay when he got hit in the head because then you gotta do this whole rigamarole and well we only care about Finals revenues, so... you know."""
heat_forever,And your team got swept this year. Congrats.
heat_forever,Flagrant 2 on Horford easily
heat_forever,"The ball was knocked into his face, thanks for that though. Let's have LeBron knock the ball into your face and see how many teeth remain."
heat_forever,"Wow, I'm shocked it's essentially 10 year deals for all of them. We're going to see EJ/Chuck/Kenny together in their 60's (Shaq will be 53 at the end of the contract)."
heat_forever,Because fuck derrick rose
heat_forever,There was no travel violation called though
heat_forever,"LeBron saw this thread this morning and thought ""hmm, it's about time for another one I think"""
heat_forever,"The question is, did he take them at all."
heat_forever,This Clippers bench is so fucking bad
heat_forever,Josh Smith is 100% on 3-pointers this game.
heat_forever,"If Hawks let the Cavs' garbage time players get points, they have ZERO chance tonight."
heat_forever,"His injury won't go away without a month or two of rest. No matter how many games he sits out (besides all of them), the second he steps out on the court and tries to do anything, he re-aggravates it. Same thing happened to D-Wade with a bone bruise a couple of years ago. It just won't go away until the offseason. LeBron has to carry another team to the Finals to be sacrificed to the Western Conference."
heat_forever,Learning from the King!
heat_forever,If Griffin won't back down Parker...
heat_forever,"There was article recently showing where the free throws were clanking, and Drummond is hopeless - his shots go all over the place. But Jordan's had an interesting quirk, they were all pretty much straight on to the rim in a narrow band - just too hard or too soft.

If he's really struggling with just being too strong to shoot softly enough, he should find a natural shooting motion he can replicate and just back up 4-6 inches from the line. I think that will add a significant % to his free throws. 

It seems like Dwight Howard is doing this since I've noticed he lines up behind the free throw line."
heat_forever,"JR should have throw his arm to the side and ""draw the foul"""
heat_forever,Kyrie Irving has been waived by the Cleveland Cavaliers
heat_forever,They'd still be peeling Teague off the stanchion at the start of Game 2.
heat_forever,Fouling off the ball player in the last 2 minutes of the game results in a free throw and letting them keep possession.
heat_forever,http://www.basketball-reference.com/referees/goblejo99r.html
heat_forever,Green about to get baptized by the LeSavior
heat_forever,"Turner wouldn't pay the NBA if they weren't making a HEALTHY profit off of it. It also allows them to charge cable providers a lot more for their channels which is even more profit outside of advertising.

Makes me wonder why the major sports leagues don't just get together and make their own major cable and online sports network with non-stop live sports and cut ESPN and Turner out as middlemen. Riskier, but it allows for almost unlimited revenue as live sports are about the only reliable advertising vehicle left."
heat_forever,What's this? The Spurs not getting all the calls? The refs need to check their instagram.
heat_forever,Bulls always lose their cool against LeBron - haven't they figured out after like 5 years that they can't rattle him?
heat_forever,"Man, it takes 5 fouls to get a foul call for poor LeBron"
heat_forever,Enjoy the retirement parties!
heat_forever,James is abusing Butler like a rented mule
heat_forever,"Game over Cavvies, somehow Atlanta will blow out the Cavs in Game 4... because the league needs the money."
heat_forever,Lord Commander LeBron and he'll order Blatt to dig up new latrines.
heat_forever,"They can review at any time, but they are compelled to in last 2 minutes if someone asks for it."
heat_forever,"When Horford says ""brotherhood"" he means ""black players and my teammates"". Non-black players (especially foreigners on other teams) aren't in the ""brotherhood""."
heat_forever,"""NBA Champion Kevin Love!"""
heat_forever,"Spurs played their best possible half and hit almost every 3 they took, they should be scared because they can't keep it up for a whole game."
heat_forever,"It was Chris Bosh, as evidenced by our team's fortunes once he went down. Thanks for playing, remember to spay and neuter your pets."
heat_forever,Reminds me of when Lance tried to out-psyche LeBron and laid out some wildly outrageous flops (like flopping on the floor dead kind of flops) and wound up fucking up the whole series for the Pacers.
heat_forever,"Awful, talks over everyone, doesn't really understand the flow and then got smacked down by EJ for talking over the music, lol"
heat_forever,Now I can truly say I'm OK with any remaining team winning (even LelBron's team!)
heat_forever,"He did blow out his knee this year, came back faster than Westbrook."
heat_forever,"Can't really compare the Hawks to Cavs this year until the Cavs had their full team.

Since the acquisitions, Cavs went 34-9 while Hawks went 29-14. And Cavs have gone 12-2 in the playoffs while Hawks went 8-8.

I think that's pretty much how it's going to go next year for these teams."
heat_forever,Kermit's running punch on Rudy that re-arranged his face was the impetus to outlaw closed fists in a basketball game.
heat_forever,"Owners lockout, players strike"
heat_forever,"Kyrie can't look at Pau in the mirror, which means Pau is a vampire."
heat_forever,The whole Warriors bench gave a dirty look when Harden hit that jumper
heat_forever,"No, it's because he landed on someone's foot. Come on now, don't be dramatic."
heat_forever,I think it will work out for the Cavs since the luxury tax line will go way up after next year and continue to rise at a very fast pace as the new TV deal goes on. So the luxury tax hit gets less and less over time since the Cavs will only be able to add vet mins and MLE salaries.
heat_forever,We'd still be in the middle of game 1 with DeAndre on his 3000th free throw.
heat_forever,"It's sad what this sub-reddit has become it's just overflowing with homers and people who literally downvote facts now. So pathetic.

"
heat_forever,"Better to rule in hell (college bball, 100% authority over players, 100% job security) than to serve in heaven (NBA, having to tickle player's balls to keep them happy, fired on a whim)"
heat_forever,Duncan and Ginobli
heat_forever,Gundy's never been the same since he made love to Alonzo's leg and never got a call back.
heat_forever,Pau was seeing a vision of the near future
heat_forever,More weak-minded Hawks getting T'd up.
heat_forever,It ended awful but people forget he was shooting 50% from 3 for the first half of the year and was making all those old guys on the team look 5 years younger.
heat_forever,It drove Klay the whole rest of the season
heat_forever,First time.
heat_forever,Losing in the Finals
heat_forever,"Don't see Horford's leg dislocated, sorry."
heat_forever,FUCK YOU SPURS WITH YOUR FUCKING BULLSHIT! EAT IT!
heat_forever,"When LeBron ""17%"" James hits a 3, you know it's working for the Cavs"
heat_forever,"Of course Dunleavey undercutting and trying to get someone injured, Bulls are just full of punks"
heat_forever,This Chris Paul performance is our generation's Willis Reed
heat_forever,Popovich already said he would refuse to go to work in July - so I guess he likes back-to-backs.
heat_forever,I'm always suspicious of refs who do showboat calls - it's obvious they like the attention.
heat_forever,At least he wasn't in pain with us. It's gotta suck having no help and being in pain.
heat_forever,"Yeah if he still wants to coach basketball, he should coach high school basketball. Much less stressful and don't have to answer questions between quarters, lol"
heat_forever,FUCKING CHRIS PAUL ON ONE LEG

heat_forever,"If they were really the 3rd or 4th best team, then they had an easier option: just win your fucking series, lol"
heat_forever,Doc wished that was Austin hitting that shot.
heat_forever,"That's because they don't sell it for 1 5 second spot, it's there for the whole season/postseason. They aren't interested in little shits like us, lol

This has been tried already 2 years running - it never gets anywhere and it never will."
heat_forever,What the fuck kind of foul is that when Dunleavey bobbled his goofy self into LeBron?
heat_forever,The wind currents over Joey's bald head affects shots
heat_forever,They should have taken Klay's shooting hand away
heat_forever,Dude is hobbled and hurts him team by trying to tough it out.
heat_forever,Clippers are gonna win this series. Basketball gods can't fuck a team this hard for this long.
heat_forever,"Is Noah a good defensive rebounder? 

Mozgov: No."
heat_forever,"If the Clippers bank everything on his jump shot, god help them"
heat_forever,"Two handed pushes to a guy in mid-air is a flagrant foul. If Antic just jumped straight up and contested, LeBron would have no chance to make that shot. Why not just play basketball instead of trying to hurt players?"
heat_forever,Hawks need to figure out their summer vacation plans.
heat_forever,"Popovich is so desperate, he can't up come up with winning strategies anymore."
heat_forever,"""Thousands"" so only 0.1% of the analysts picked the poor Spurs. Doc must have spent all night combing the internets to find these Spurs-favorite diamonds in the rough.

These are the only ones who matter. Only Barkley and maybe a handful of others were publicly for the Clippers. Show us your list of thousands of Clippers predictors."
heat_forever,SHOWBOAT CALLS!
heat_forever,"I agree, I think Howard got the monkey (dat's racist) off his back of having to be the superstar. He's always seemed like he couldn't handle the spotlight and would prefer to do his work unnoticed. I think that's sustainable if it leads to rings... if Houston gets knocked off though, I see Howard turning very pissy (as he did when he got himself kicked out of the Game 4 blowout)."
heat_forever,"If you're white, you're not part of the brotherhood. Kenny is really doing a disservice to himself, he has no logical reason to say this other than some deep-seeded bias against Dellavedova."
heat_forever,I agree. Let Love take his player option and trade him to the Lakers for Ed Davis and Nick Young and picks - Nick Young and JR Smith trading step-back contested 3's while LeBron smirks from the bench... pure gold.
heat_forever,"He left the Heat because he needed more ""help"" and less reliance on himself."
heat_forever,"Dellavedova: ""You call this a close out? THIS IS A CLOSE OUT.""

*cue aboriginal kazoo music and swinging koalas*"
heat_forever,"Terry gets crushed and hacked, no call... "
heat_forever,That's exactly what it was for
heat_forever,"TOUCH FOUL OF COURSE, LET'S DECIDE THIS GAME ON TOUCH FOULS"
heat_forever,Rockets showing the Clippers how they could have held on to Game 6... just barrel into a guy and get free throws - I'm kind of shocked any team can go on a 17-0 run in the playoffs...
heat_forever,"If you get to the Finals, you should play like you want to win. That's all."
heat_forever,Apparently Delly can foul someone while he's busy falling down
heat_forever,@KingJames: Stop trying to find a way to OPT-IN and just OPT-OUT. Be apart of something special somewhere else! Just my thoughts
heat_forever,I hope they have defibrillators on hand at courtside for Steve Ballmer's epic heart attack.
heat_forever,"Every tryhard in this subreddit want hard fouls and knocking players out of mid air to prevent layups and hard thug playoff basketball, but when Dellavedova goes for a loose ball, he's satan reincarnate."
heat_forever,"""Just showing you all what Perk taught me"""
heat_forever,"How can a ref not see it, and still be so sure of what he didn't see?"
heat_forever,TAJ GIBSON - MENTAL MIDGET - eject that asshole
heat_forever,He didn't even score in the first quarter
heat_forever,We might not see Kyrie again until Game 7 of the Finals
heat_forever,If Griffin is hitting that... nothing you can do
heat_forever,"Warriors gave permission. I guess coaching spots are time-sensitive as they can be interviewed and hired at any time. 

It's why players can't be moved until July 1 to avoid flooding the news with trades during the Finals. Easy thing is for NBA to apply that to coaches to just to avoid this awkwardness."
heat_forever,"Celtics fans, Bulls fans and other Cavs/LeBron haters"
heat_forever,"Most shocking part of it all, like nobody gave a shit. You'd expect a bit more out of a game 5."
heat_forever,Who said I'm anti-Spurs? You're just shocked someone isn't licking their asshole.
heat_forever,Poor Phil Jackson
heat_forever,What's this? The Spurs not getting all the calls? The refs need to check their LinkedIn.
heat_forever,40 point loss for Houston incoming
heat_forever,Nanobots worked a little faster than expected
heat_forever,"""There will never be ads on jerseys... without my approval which I gave this morning."""
heat_forever,"Refs have decided to fuck over the Clippers, so it's pretty much settled who's gonna win."
heat_forever,"So you guys hate it when they ask softball questions or silly questions but when they ask a hardball and legitimate question, you hate it too?

There's no reason an NBA point guard should go an entire game with zero assists."
heat_forever,and 7th man... and 8th man...
heat_forever,The Bulls are so predictable. Get in their head a little and they unravel - the team is too full of hotheads and thugs... LeBron always figures out how to expose them.
heat_forever,Is Rose really planning on getting back into this game?
heat_forever,On to Game 7
heat_forever,"Wade also got to the Finals at a young age against a very strong team and dropped 40 a game to win his ring. So, what's LeBron's excuse again? "
heat_forever,Rachel basically asked JR why he isn't as big of a cancer to the Cavs as he was to the Knicks.
heat_forever,"I think Harden just wanted Dwight to shoot the pull-up 3 to secure his triple double, lol"
heat_forever,"Still, just shows how a commitment means nothing - Marc might say the same thing once he sees Duncan and Ginobli are gone and then the Spurs lost Splitter and Diaw for nothing."
heat_forever,"Uh, basically if you are a NBA team and you get paid tons of money to play you should be able to win a few games at like 70%+. Even if you have to play everyday (I get that some of these dudes have tantrums that make it difficult). So no they shouldn't change the rules, more rules just takes away from the purity of the game itself."
heat_forever,That's pretty much what happened here. Two girls though.
heat_forever,Why would you put gimpy Kyrie on the line for a tech...
heat_forever,"Magic was young when he won his first Finals and then he went to 8 more and won 5 total. 

Groupthink: 5 of 9 Finals &gt; 6 of 6 Finals"
heat_forever,"You know what, efficiency isn't everything. Last year when LeBron was 56%, he was giving up easy shots to protect his % and letting guys like Chris Andersen take 20 foot shots. He would rarely take more than 15 shots even if he was 13-15 or something crazy like that. He was obsessed with ""efficiency"" to the detriment of the team.

I always argued that it would be better for LeBron to shoot 50% the entire season on 22-25 shots than him shooting 15 shots at 56% and the rest of the team shooting 44%."
heat_forever,"Most Spurs fans are only around for 1 championship, then they quit when the Spurs don't repeat. Most Spurs fans from 2 days ago have already quit on the team."
heat_forever,Curry is falling back into his old habits of looking for a showboat play instead of a proper play...
heat_forever,How does LeBron always have the good fortune to end up on the same team as James Jones!
heat_forever,I feel like Blake aged from 25 to 35 in one season
heat_forever,Pacquaio subs in for Paul and hits 7 3 pointers in a row and then Chris Paul takes the beating from Mayweather so Pac-Man can collect Chris Paul's entire 5 year salary in one night.
heat_forever,"""that's unsportsmanlike"" says the Boston fan"
heat_forever,Did Hubie think the Draymond dunk counted?
heat_forever,Klay's dad said he couldn't drive.
heat_forever,"It's also priced very expensive because they only want SERIOUS sponsors who are going to be paying for numerous spots (they probably sell only a postseason package).

Maybe they might throw a mid-January game as a bone to us, but they'd rather not cheapen the ad spot with a silly mention of an internet forum. They want recognizable sponsors who have deep pockets."
heat_forever,It's so much easier to find him on TV with the headband. Thanks for thinking of the viewers LeBron
heat_forever,"He couldn't even run up and down the court as of Tuesday - he's done for the series. If Gibson is suspended, then Pau will be forced to go out and be completely ineffective."
heat_forever,"Nah, it was fun. Now go lance your ears to relieve all that blood pressure building up."
heat_forever,"It just shows that sports is really just based on luck and getting extreme value from players outside of their prime (paying low salary early in career but getting all-star performance or paying a vet a low salary and getting occasional flashes of brilliance). It's rare to pay a superstar his value and get enough worth, it has to be a transcendent player who would elevate any team he's on.

So after a long time, the Rangers got enough pieces to be a strong team and haven't had to constantly reboot their entire franchise every time a new GM comes in."
heat_forever,"""Eat a d!ck"""
heat_forever,9th time. No team has come back from 3-0
heat_forever,"Claiming Kyrie = Rose would get you shot in your team subreddit...

I think the Bull's real problem is that Rose isn't really a leader and there's no veteran on the team to curtail all the bullshit that goes on (the thug mentality) - if that culture was stomped out, the Bulls would be so much more successful with their talent, but it ends up psyching them out of too many games and too many series when they constantly feel disrespected all the time. Whining about calls, flagrantly fouling, getting tossed out of games constantly... it's all a culture that Thibs either condoned or didn't have the power to shut down. A coach needs help from his captains, but usually it was the captains egging on their teammates or doing it themselves. Sad.

Mirotic definitely didn't learn to be a thug from outside the Bulls - he just had bad mentors and it cost them the game when he clotheslined Shumpert."
heat_forever,No team in NBA history has come back from 0-3
heat_forever,Tonight he'll go 11-12 from 3 just for shits and giggles.
heat_forever,LeBender James Rodriguez
heat_forever,"Bird rights let them go over the cap, in fact, letting anyone go is a bad move since they won't be able to replace them. Keeping this team together (at any price) is all they can do."
heat_forever,LeBron has more physical advantages than Jordan but he obviously doesn't have the mental advantage.
heat_forever,"1/82 of salary for regular season game. Not really sure about playoffs, since they don't get paid regular salary for that."
heat_forever,"Yeah Jordan never practiced NBA-range 3 pointers in his entire life and grew up without even the concept of a 3-point line. He only shot well during the short range years because he was just a good shooter and 22 feet was in his range. 

If Jordan came up today, he'd be an elite 3-point shooter if he put in the time to work on it. He was just too obsessed with being the best and if that's what constituted being the best, he'd work at it."
heat_forever,"He two arm shoved a guy in the back onto the floor and then kicked him... they didn't even punish him for the kick, he got ejected for the full out shove."
heat_forever,"Shhh, it'll all be over soon. "
heat_forever,"Smith has the right idea, just barge in there every play."
heat_forever,"It's official, the NBA is shitting on the Hawks"
heat_forever,"Depends on Kyrie's health - but neither really.

LeBron can only lose in the Finals"
heat_forever,Thompson icing his shoulder not because of too many rebounds - too many assholes undercutting him
heat_forever,If only LeBron had good teammates. Maybe he'll find that elusive team this offseason.
heat_forever,"When he's ""unemployed"" he has $100 million+ sitting in the bank. It's not exactly the same as your ""unemployed""."
heat_forever,"Never trust a Gasol until he's signed the contract. Pau Gasol committed to the Heat last season then said ""no thanks"", lol

So it's silly to trust these guys on hope and dreams. All that matters is a signature on a contract."
heat_forever,"That Delly is a dirty player, and that the league agrees because they gave him a tech, the other 3 tried to talk him down but he doubled down and kept going with it."
heat_forever,"Gonna prop myself for one of my gold posts:

heat_forever,"That's just an advertisement, they are paid to do that."
heat_forever,I swear Doc is going to sit CP3 the whole series to push his kid's career.
heat_forever,"This should prove to everyone that these guys are just playing roles on TV and that Shaq and Barkley are buddies and as annoyed as Barkley might appear to get, he knows Shaq is doing a schtick and Shaq knows Barkley is doing a schtick and Kenny is Kenny and Ernie is a black friend."
heat_forever,That's what happens when they are allowed to push in the back every time
heat_forever,They can talk to the police after the game if it bothers them that much. I see no justification for pushing a fan who can get into their head so easily.
heat_forever,"No Love, no Kyrie, LeBron shooting like shit, Cavs lay a giant goose egg in points for 6 straight minutes to open the 2nd half to basically let the Bulls back in it and the Bulls counter with 2 points...

Then the crowd keeps booing Dellavedova of all people (who the fuck would boo a role player) and he personally deep dicks them in the ass going in dry with no warning with that emotionless face of his just sticking multiple dagger 3s with no remorse."
heat_forever,LeBron's been there and was able to prepare his team better. The Hawks just had no idea what hit them.
heat_forever,He didn't take more shots because he couldn't. Sorry if it was too complex for you.
heat_forever,"Kenny is still flustered from his boneheaded comments earlier, voice is cracking"
heat_forever,Dunleavey just had a negative shower room flashback
heat_forever,"And all he had to do was to hit for his field goal % (51% instead of 35%)

Game 1 - lost by 9, LeBron goes 4-16 for 14 points (13 below his avg)

Game 2 - lost by 11, LeBron played OK - no chance of winning this one

Game 3 - lost by 3, LeBron goes 9-23 - just needed to hit 2 more shots

Game 4 - lost by 1, LeBron goes 10-30 (!) - just needed to hit 1 more shot

That's 3 games they could have won and 1 more game they would have needed. 

So don't tell me the Spurs blew up the Cavs or the Cavs had no hope of winning, people have such short memories (or more likely, they didn't even watch the series)."
heat_forever,Except LeBron didn't even touch him. It was a bit too ambitious of a flop.
heat_forever,Is it deleted? I said nothing except the truth.
heat_forever,1 of them might as well be Roy Hibbert
heat_forever,"LeBron's whole body looks broken when he goes up for a jump-shot, lots of little problems causing his aim to be way off. Yet he still hits clutch buzzer-beaters to win playoff games."
heat_forever,"LeBron: ""I learned about backboard English from a guard I adore very much who's watching me right now... Dwyane Wade"""
heat_forever,Adam Silver would be jizzing uncontrollably if both series went to 7 and then hanging himself if the Hawks and Rockets advanced to the worst rated Finals of all time.
heat_forever,Dwight laying out his exit strategy to not have to finish this game
heat_forever,"Yes, D-Wade won a title in 2006, maybe you should check his basketball reference page once in a while. U mite lern urself."
heat_forever,"LeBron's taking notes: 

How 2 beat Golden State:

1. Don't miss 3 pointers"
heat_forever,Karl Malone with this Spurs team for 20 years wins at least 8-10 rings. He was just a more consistent 25-12 player well into his late 30's. The only reason he's disrespected around here is his sexual proclivities and lack of rings.
heat_forever,There's a reason Spo kept James Jones planted on the bench
heat_forever,I think LeBron hit 3 straight 3 pointers during the rally
heat_forever,"I feel the main difference between the two is that when Jordan hit a wall, he got better to get over it. LeBron was always good, so when he hit a wall, he ran away from it.

Jordan was a scrawny kid growing up told he would never make it... LeBron was anointed the King at age 14. So... it's no wonder they wound up having very different mentalities in how they both chased greatness."
heat_forever,"""Three point line ruined the game!""

""Shot clock ruined the game!""

""Dribbling ruined the game!"""
heat_forever,Obviously there are micro magnets all along the black lines of the ball and around the rim.

*Joe Harris sheds a tear of joy*"
heat_forever,"Eh, Houston will shit this lead away in 3 minutes in the 2nd quarter"
heat_forever,LeBron's set the game to rookie mode
heat_forever,Amazing how fast Spurs fans turn on their own hall of famers. At least wait until he's traded!
heat_forever,"And only 3 rounds of playoffs with a bye in the first round that Boston often got. They got to face a tired team after 2-3 weeks off every year, lol"
heat_forever,Mozgov has really great hands for alley-oops
heat_forever,Every foul on LeBron has been so weak
heat_forever,"Hawks body language looks awful - unless they get a spirited half-time talk, they'll be facing 0-2"

heat_forever,ENJOY IT BABY!
heat_forever,He would never get meaningful minutes on any team that wasn't run by his father. It's sad how much nepotism could ruin the clippers - but really they have no one else available.
heat_forever,"I don't think a team capable of 50 wins will absorb a new player so easily since they have something that works already. Tough for rookies to even sniff the court.

It would have to be something like a crappy team winning 15 games one year and then their draft pick turns them into a 70 win team."
heat_forever,Might be the first ever three-point flagrant and-one
heat_forever,"Yup, it's classy when a millionaire coach and a billionaire owner are calling some middle-class shotclock operator a ""dumb fuck"" over and over. How charming and classy these guys are when they are unfiltered."
heat_forever,"He's 25 or 26, he can play 48 minutes a game - either dude is on drugs or he's not eating properly."
heat_forever,"When J.R. Smith is locking down fools, you know the series is over."
heat_forever,Spurs fans are the sorest losers.
heat_forever,"I didn't rest him, the Heat rested him. It was a bad move that I never supported and often got hate from other Heat fans for. It wasted LeBron's energy as we all saw in the Finals. If they played him every game, they probably win 64-66, get home court and handle the Spurs again. C'est la vie!"
heat_forever,"Ah yeah, that's correct when the NBA went from 29 to 30 teams."
heat_forever,"Yeah but the Hawks are in the middle of getting fully exposed. It's obvious the Cavs were the best team in the East from Jan-Apr and if they had a bit more time, they'd have overtaken the Hawks easily. Next year, Atlanta isn't going to win the East. We all have to deal with these Cavs for the next 3 years potentially."
heat_forever,"Exactly, so it's beneficial for the team to pretend it's not a concussion and avoid all that. They will put him in and act like everything is ok and then they don't have to deal with him being out next game if he wakes up with the sniffles."
heat_forever,"""probably never"" - just go full ""never""!"
heat_forever,"Love keeps Tristan off the floor though... and in the playoffs, having a guy giving you 2nd and 3rd opportunities is critical.

If the Heat had a guy like Thompson, they'd have won 4 straight Finals - the Heat NEVER got an offensive rebound and would often give up 4 straight possessions on the other end because Spoelstra didn't believe in rebounding. Got fucked hard for it many times.

Now with Whiteside, Speolstra has seen the light a bit."
heat_forever,When that bruise is on your brain though
heat_forever,Horford sounds like he's cutting a WWE promo.
heat_forever,"I think because he looked so unaggressive. It's a quiet 24/13/7 but still impressive none the less. Just couldn't overcome the massive storyline of Paul carrying the team on his one leg and making some CRITICAL 3 pointers.

One right after he sprained his hammy, the one to close out the 3rd quarter after the Spurs got a bullshit 3 free throws, 2 to start the 4th quarter... and then of course, hitting the impossible game winning shot put."
heat_forever,The main advantage LeBron has is not having to face LeBron in the east
heat_forever,"Because that's what happened during the play. The play was already over when Taj kicked Dellevedova and refs can't call a personal or flagrant foul after the play is over. It would have been a technical foul but there was no technical foul called. Therefore, the Flagrant 2 was for the in-game play where Taj pushed Dellevedova in the back."
heat_forever,They aren't a championship team though. Popovich has a proven winning strategy that he seems to be ignoring for a cheap gimmick.
heat_forever,"Well, if he somehow takes out Curry then I might start buying into the conspiracy theory that he's an assassin from the future LeCybron James sent back in time to secure a title for Cleveland."
heat_forever,That's just 1 week and will reduce about 3 back-to-backs out of average of 21 - you need about 7 weeks to eliminate back-to-backs for every team.
heat_forever,"It all depends on Kyrie. If Kyrie is at least 80% and able to cut and cause havoc and keep up with his defender, then between him, Shumpert, Delly and Iman - the splash brothers can be controlled.

There's no one on the Warriors who have any hope of defending LeBron. Green is too small and Bogut is too slow. If LeBron is aggressive with his post-up game or if his shot makes any semblance of returning to the mean, he will put up 30-10-10 every night. 

If JR gets hot, it should result in close games. Warriors have a superior bench though and can probably make up any deficits or extend any leads when LeBron has to sit. If Curry or Klay gets hot, Cavs probably have no chance.

Cavs won't screw up quite as bad in late game situations as the Rockets.

But Warriors have home court and if they manage to blitz the Cavs for 2 wins at home, it's probably series over.

If Cavs split at Oakland, then they force a game 7. If they go up 2-0, they'll win in 6. If they go down 2-0, they'll lose in 5 or 6."
heat_forever,Yes and for good coaches who didn't require me to kill myself to stay on the team. There's such a thing as bad sportsmanship from a coach.
heat_forever,Get used to those classic LeBron jump twirl passes that go out of bounds or into opponent's hands.
heat_forever,He probably can't do anything sports related that competes against ESPN while he's under contract. So he'll have to wait until the contract is done in September.
heat_forever,Kyle Rollover
heat_forever,"Why not both! Pitch every 5th day or so, play basketball shooting with his off-arm... what could possibly go wrong!"
heat_forever,Cavs have the #1 defense in the playoffs in just about every category.
heat_forever,You didn't watch last year's playoffs...?
heat_forever,"He's still injured, it won't go away until the offseason, but 2 solid weeks might have gotten it back to the point where he wouldn't re-injure himself so quickly like he did in Game 1 (after 7 days rest)."
heat_forever,Did Wall block that with a broken hand
heat_forever,[Delly's Legs According To Bulls' Fans Rants](http://generationiron.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tom-platz-quads.jpg)
heat_forever,"Like Mozgov's effort, he's been very involved"
heat_forever,"Why waste their time with Dellavedova, they will go after LeBron"
heat_forever,"Davis was standing still, these refs are fucking horrible."
heat_forever,Easily
heat_forever,"Horford walks when he got the ball, same thing they call Mozgov all night for"
heat_forever,"Jordan played 48 minutes of Game 6 vs Utah... when he was 35. Go cry in a river for Blake Griffin, the 26 year old who got exhausted."
heat_forever,"If Kerr went to Knicks, they'd still be a crappy team and if Fisher went to the Warriors, he'd be enjoying all this success. People would call Kerr a bum and Fisher a genius."
heat_forever,That's why you can't judge players based on playing against bored opponents in late February and March.
heat_forever,LeBron just scratched David Blatt from the Finals
heat_forever,"Good thing Korver wasn't standing there, he ran right into the sliding Dellavedova. If Korver is afraid of getting injured, he can just run away - he knew to do that when LeBron was thundering down the lane for a dunk in Game 2.

Korver's natural mentality is to run, Dellavedova's natural mentality is to go for it. Korver made a mistake going against his instincts, he should have just run."
heat_forever,Perk scratched the original play
heat_forever,"Refs don't let any defense be played, every touch foul"
heat_forever,"No, he's just willing to do the dirty work, every team needs that guy"
heat_forever,"Even then, it's still illegal according to the federal government and all it takes is the next Republican president to start putting the feds back to work to raiding, arresting and prosecuting marijuana users again in all 50 states."
heat_forever,Yeah I'm sure having 2 starters go down for the season had nothing to do with it. I'm sure it's easier to talk out your ass though.
heat_forever,There is literally nothing anyone can ever say that should ever bother a professional athlete. I think it reveals a mental weakness if you let irrelevant smack talk get to you - it's completely meaningless. A professional doesn't listen to the crowd.
heat_forever,Seems like the same old story every year with Harden - his entire game is a regular season game. Drawing fouls. Then it falls apart in the playoffs because the refs won't call it as much. Harden has to re-invent his game and stick to playing basketball instead of exploiting loopholes.
heat_forever,Mirotic has that Manu like tendency to foul after he gets beat.
heat_forever,Not even a single shit
heat_forever,"ESPN: Kevin Love confirms he ""has moved on"", reactions from LeBron"
heat_forever,"Team doctor works for the team. Team knows if there's a concussion protocol failure then Klay could be out for Game 1 automatically or even the entire Finals. So they just ask Klay ""hey did you have a concussion"" and he says ""No"" and so they don't bother with the test. It's why the NFL moved to neutral unbiased doctors, because teams constantly tried to avoid the concussion protocol."
heat_forever,LeBron had some roasted bull testicles for lunch.
heat_forever,He tore one during the Bulls series but snapped back after the break.
heat_forever,"lol, only 21 years ago LeBron went undefeated at age 9"
heat_forever,"But Parker alone isn't the ""Big 3"". 

Will Popovich leave the second Duncan leaves? No, I don't think so.

Will he endure more than 1 losing season in a row at this stage in his career... No, I don't think so."
heat_forever,"When LeBron checked out for the last time with his LelBron face, he looked at some white dude on the Cavs bench like he had no idea who the hell he was."
heat_forever,he'll be handed the pink slip as the buzzer sounds
heat_forever,"""look at my beard, it was me ref!"""
heat_forever,"Actually the Celtics were that much better than everyone else. They had a huge advantage since the draft allowed teams to basically ""claim"" players from their territory and the northeast just was a hotbed for college basketball players. And lots of good players went to Boston because drafting wasn't really a fair process back then. Every other team was lucky to have 1 superstar and whatever players they found off the street."
heat_forever,"Heat already have whatever pieces they can get for next 3 years and are capped out anyway with or without Wade. 

They will have healthy Bosh + full season of Dragic (if he signs) and emerging Whiteside plus returning pieces like Josh McRoberts and at least 1 more year of Deng. This is the team, for better or worse, for the next 3-4 years. If all those pieces are there then there's no difference cap-wise whether you pay Wade $12M or $21M.

It's literally just a suddenly cheap owner who's wallet-shy when the rings aren't nearly automatic anymore. Wade should get paid, simple as that. Then retool when Bosh and Wade's contracts are over. They'll still have MLE to entice vets, but it's silly to think they can keep Wade and get anyone else. They are capped even if Wade gets screwed on his deal."
heat_forever,He should just stop resting players in November and screwing his team over first.
heat_forever,"Ariza somehow concussed both the splash bros, payment from LeBron, Inc. deposited in his bank account"
heat_forever,"When you feel you should have won, then yes..."
heat_forever,The Knicks offense hasn't figured it out either.
heat_forever,Problem is LeBron was tired of working like a dog in the playoffs only to come up short in the Finals - seems like he's headed down the same path.
heat_forever,"Even then, a 7 foot plus 350 pound plus guy took a bump onto a hard floor with no padding but his stomach."
heat_forever,This is sportsmanship at it's finest. I hope it's a great series.
heat_forever,"Finally, the NBA has defeated Racism and the Spurs."
heat_forever,Cavs won't have that problem.
heat_forever,"The point is, Howard was shoved by Bogut in the first place, once they start calling those properly, then you don't even have to worry about retaliation. Funny how that works... "
heat_forever,What if he bangs the prom queen too
heat_forever,"Blatt never likes to sit the starters, he's got a bit of the ol' Thibs in him"
heat_forever,"That's weird, Sage Steele was gone and it was just the SportsCenter guys while Jalen and Doug sat there silently and said nothing... lol"
heat_forever,Jordan was too obsessed with winning to risk losing from drinking too much.
heat_forever,I think LeBron would need to win 6 straight to get over the stigma of losing 3 already.
heat_forever,"He can't slam with one hand and can barely reach the rim now with two hands, so he'd need to be wide open."
heat_forever,"Um, it's 12...

"
heat_forever,"Refs fall for every Spurs flop, lets the Clippers get mauled and calls every ticky-tack foul for the Spurs, then Spurs win.

Refs call fair game, Clippers win."
heat_forever,"Regular season means nothing, a lot of teams just won't defend as well during the season and so a lot of Golden State's bad habits were left uncorrected. A 67-win team should really never lose 2 games in a series, but they were exposed a bit by Memphis."
heat_forever,Trevor Ariza is always on teams that go deep - he's really a catalyst for success.
heat_forever,At least one game this series should have both teams entirely foul out hacking Jordan and Howard.
heat_forever,"I fixed your votes, fuck em Spurs! If this was the Finals, I'd put it on par with Ray Allen's shot. But even then, it's top 3 shot of all time considering everything that was riding on Paul's career and legacy, being on one leg and just flat out fucking the Spurs!"
heat_forever,"He wraps his arms around people and literally pushes them away, but somehow the refs never see it. "
heat_forever,THIS FUCKING GAME MENG
heat_forever,"MUCH EASY, VERY CRUISING"
heat_forever,FADE EM FLAIRS SPURS!
heat_forever,Almost LeBron like including the raw power to shove people into oblivion.
heat_forever,"Cavs can't get a foul to save their lives, they are going to blow this next play, then Korver will hit a 35 footer"
heat_forever,"The owners show just how devilishly smart they are by getting the NBA fanbase to be their bitches in support of billionaires to make more money off the backs of the only people in the world capable of making that money for those billionaires. 

These same people should go in to work and ask their CEO to cut their and all the rank and file's salaries in half to help the company earn another penny per share on their earnings report so the CEO can pocket another few billion when the stock price bumps up."
heat_forever,Just like the real thing
heat_forever,I'd like to see Popovich between two ferns with Zach.
heat_forever,"Players like Dunleavey have no skill, they just run fast and fall on their face and draw fouls somehow."
heat_forever,"FUCKING WILLIS REED, EAT YOUR HEART OUT!"
heat_forever,It's a shame Kobe didn't even realize how hot he was until about 3 minutes left in the first quarter.
heat_forever,"Statistically, Wade was the 2nd best shooting guard in the league last year."
heat_forever,"They can, but LeBron has been here before and knows how to work the bully ball and either stop runs by drawing fouls or just posting up for easy buckets. The only way really is if Atlanta gets on fire from 3. They will not be able to come back on just 2's alone."
heat_forever,"Paul is god like right now, even on one leg. Only reason the Clippers are in this."
heat_forever,"Not even close - Hakeem had his two years while Jordan was retired. But Jordan was clearly, undoubtedly and unanimously the best player alive in 1996."
heat_forever,"lol, trying to face guard JR Smith - that increases his 3 pt shooting skill by 20 pts"
heat_forever,James just took out Carroll's legs! What a dirty player!
heat_forever,Kyrie's benched - good move Blatt
heat_forever,Good thing or Jordan would have 11 rings and Spurs 0
heat_forever,I can't believe they are pinning all their hopes on Blake 18 footers - this could backfire
heat_forever,Miller hasn't used his legs in like a month
heat_forever,"I can't tell what your flair is, it looks so faded! "
heat_forever,"Except they weren't thinking of retiring 2 years ago, good try."
heat_forever,^ bad example of a Spurs fan
heat_forever,"Silver: Mr. Kobe, your pick will be delivered as promised

Kobe: It better be, you bald-headed American Gothic freak"
heat_forever,Or Tim Duncan 2 free throws to tie it. 
heat_forever,"The league wants the Hawks to win to extend the series, Cavs have to fight the impossible fight here"
heat_forever,"If a player lets a fan get to him in any way shape or form, that player has completely lost it. There is nothing a fan can verbally say that should ever impact a player at all."
heat_forever,"Producer: ""Ok Lou, this is the part where you make an eery prediction about winning it all that we'll replay in June to show what a visionary believer you were""

Lou: ""go fuck yourself"""
heat_forever,Blouses have been on a tear this weekend
heat_forever,"Kobe should be the star sent to accept the #1 pick. He can wear a T-shirt that says ""You're welcome"""
heat_forever,Millsap throws his arm to the side... bullshit
heat_forever,Why'd Harden throw it to Dwight with 3 seconds left? Did he want him to take the pullup 3? Maybe call a timeout or something.
heat_forever,If the Clippers find some bullshit way to lose... lol
heat_forever,Rose called it for him
heat_forever,"Except he went into Shumpert's face - this is what happens when an eastern european kid gets stuck with a bunch of thugs, he thinks this is how to earn ""respect""."
heat_forever,Harden with the judgment finger
heat_forever,How can he look himself in the mirror though.
heat_forever,TT is hax
heat_forever,Then he should easily beat the Bulls and waltz into the Finals again... or maybe your theory is bunk. So which is it? Do you have so little faith in your team?
heat_forever,I don't know how people can't tell he's totally playing a role on TV.
heat_forever,"You guys need to make up your mind, been shitting on Parker all day. "
heat_forever,"Last year I used to get mad at LeBron for so many games where he goes 11-14 and then stopped shooting to protect his FG%. 

This year he's giving no fucks about his stats and just chucking up some horrible shots."
heat_forever,Toss Gibson's ass out
heat_forever,"Such a genius play, everyone knew what they were doing. They should have just taken a shot though. Gimmick plays don't work - like fouling Jordan again this game."
heat_forever,"Let's check back when MJ's career is finally over.

If Kobe had LeBron's body, he'd be working on his 20th straight chip next year though."
heat_forever,"Cleveland had 6+ minutes of bonus, need to drive every time."
heat_forever,"I think the only advantage Cleveland has is LeBron will have zero butterflies in his stomach and knows exactly what to expect. 

Since there will be a 9-day layoff, I can see the jitterbugs getting a bit too big in Game 1 for the Warriors."
heat_forever,Apparently 3's are better than layups and dunks according to the anal-tics nerds.
heat_forever,"Come on folks, there's no more NBA until 6/4 - but this guy lays some bait to keep people checking his feed and articles until either the story breaks or nothing happens... clicks amassed, cashmoney deposited."
heat_forever,"Momentum can be stopped cold with a series of shrewdly timed calls in one direction while also giving the other team meaningless calls to keep it balanced in the final count. 

Other sports have clearly defined fouls and rules for when those fouls are called and are easily verifiable and quantifiable. Half the calls in the NBA are ""welp, we felt like calling it this time""."
heat_forever,"Yup, they were pretty much a well-matched pair. Both had similar mentality and durability."
heat_forever,He never said TT was a top 10 offensive rebounder either.
heat_forever,Joey would have T'd up all the Spurs and ended the game before he'd ever admit he did something wrong.
heat_forever,They pay these guys $100 million contracts and the owners are billionaires - $1 million is a drop in the bucket.
heat_forever,"^ thought you said ""Bye."" already. Run along now."
heat_forever,The commissioner (Adam Silver in this case) picks All-Star injury replacements
heat_forever,Bulls played one of their best quarters of the series and still down 1... gotta be demoralizing.
heat_forever,"It's the size of the hands and how strong you are. Shaq/Howard/Jordan are probably too strong to properly modulate their shooting strength. It's really the same as trying to shoot a tennis ball.

Yao/Marc/Dirk are big guys but I doubt they are as strong as Shaq/Howard/Jordan. So they need to put in more than minimum effort to shoot a free throw. Shaq/Howard/Jordan need to put in less than minimum and it gets difficult to properly shoot like that.

The solution I think is to move behind the line even a slight bit to exert more effort into the free throw to the point where they can properly judge the strength required. Jordan and Howard only really miss by being too hard or too soft."
heat_forever,DELLY EATS FLOPS FOR BREAKFAST
heat_forever,That sidebar picture looks like Harden is shooting from the third row of the stands
heat_forever,"I think he's a shitty player, I don't like any player who's only purpose to jump into people and shove people out of the way and only get called for 1 foul out of every 10."
heat_forever,"admit it, you wanted to say like a bull"
heat_forever,Someone just got creamed by Harden's shoe
heat_forever,Golden State is a team that relies on way too many bad shots to go down. I don't see them beating the Clippers who have a more reliable game.
heat_forever,How did Bud call a timeout without the ball?
heat_forever,San Antonio can't keep up with these Clippers. They've been chasing them for 1.5 games
heat_forever,"No Kyrie, no Love and the Hawks can barely keep up with them? Doesn't bode well for Atlanta."
heat_forever,"Klay: Potatoes

Team: Close enough"
heat_forever,The ball is constantly bouncing in weird ways off the rim right to Warrior players. Very lucky
heat_forever,"lol, these team doctors are so full of shit"
heat_forever,Davis - 40 PER next season
heat_forever,"I see Butler take the hits all the time, but when he wants a foul call, he's flying back 10 feet."
heat_forever,"There's no way Green can hope to defend LeBron, LeBron is too strong and too big. Green is too volatile and too emotional and won't be able to rattle LeBron like he does lesser mortals and LeBron will take advantage of that."
heat_forever,"What's this, Spurs not getting all the calls? These refs need to check their email."
heat_forever,"Thibs: ""KOBE, I KNOW YOU'RE 40, SHOOT UNDER 40% AND YOUR HEALTH IS AT 40% AFTER YOUR MAJOR INJURIES AND YOU FINISHED A 40 SOMETHING MILLION CONTRACT, SO GIMME 40 MINUTES A NIGHT AND I'LL DRINK A 40 IN YOUR HONOR.""

Kobe: Where have you been my entire life, you adorable fat man."
heat_forever,Yeah Spurs should be up by 20 right now. I think they are only surviving on fumes and refs propping them up.
heat_forever,There's gonna be a game where LeBron hits 12-13 on 3 pointers
heat_forever,haha james jones was standing 3 feet away
heat_forever,"That would be true with or without the tax. Yet owners still overpay players all the time. 

The repeater tax is no longer a deterrent for this year's transactions or the next few years."
heat_forever,"Finals start on 6/4 no matter what, so we'll get a slow patch of no basketball"
heat_forever,I think this game is going to end with Chris Paul doing 3 sick cross overs in a row as his entire thigh muscle sheers off his leg and he still hits the shot with just a skeleton leg.
heat_forever,"Playoff games don't count, it's strictly a regular season streak. LeBron already scored 8 points in a Finals game (vs Mavericks I believe)"
heat_forever,"Yes, there's always exception, I think it's a combination of height, hand size and strength. Wilt also had the same free throw shooting problems. I think it's rash to just say they are lazy - maybe free throws really are just harder for them and maybe some guys were able to do something extraordinary to get over it. Robinson maybe could have been a 90% free throw shooter but wound up only getting to be a 73% free throw shooter due to these limitations. We just have no idea."
heat_forever,Reggie Miller is anti-Cavs for some reason. He's totally unprofessional for a national broadcaster.
heat_forever,"Hawks look very nervous right now, it's make or break time."
heat_forever,"""Better"" teams... not sure sure about that. Boston had a better team, they just didn't have 1 individual player as good as Davis. Memphis and Chicago were pretty much even, both very tough defensive teams with limited offensive capabilities. And Atlanta is clearly a better team than Houston - but people think Atlanta sucks now because of how bad they got exposed. Maybe the Cavs are just that good?

I'm surprised you are willing to throw your Bulls under the bus just to make LeBron and the Cavs look weaker... so you're saying the Bulls got beat by a weak team then?

The Cavs, like it or not, have been by far the best team in the league since they've been constructed. Love has actually held them back. Any team that goes 14-2 in the playoffs entering the Finals is a dominant team. 

It's what we want in the Finals. Two dominant teams going head-to-head."
heat_forever,"How do you punish a guy who's retiring anyway and figures ""might as well take someone out while I'm going"""
heat_forever,"Of course, it only won us 2 more rings by winning in the playoffs. Though as a Raptors fan you probably don't want to remember that's a thing."
heat_forever,"Well LeBron did tell Rachel Nichols in his pre-game interview that he is the father of the team... Then people wonder why all this father talk comes up in the post-game interviews... it's all connected, reporters do talk to each other."
heat_forever,"holy shit, he's flat out killing the Bulls singlehandedly"
heat_forever,"If somehow the Lakers snag Kevin Love, along with a legit C in Okafur/Towns, Randle coming back, Clarkson developing, Nick Young and last year's other starters off the bench - and Kobe has an efficient 20 ppg season... they can be a legit threat."
heat_forever,"If the Rockets plan is to go down 3-1 every series, it's working so far, they may even improve on it and just go down 4-0 first"
heat_forever,Adam Silver stops the slaughter after 3 games.
heat_forever,First everyone thought the Bulls were going to handle them... then everyone knew for sure the Hawks would handle them. I guess we'll have to just play the games then.
heat_forever,"He might not get better, but there's no one available for the price he's asking who can give the same numbers."
heat_forever,Blatt: TAKE MORE SHITTY 3S!
heat_forever,"LeBron has played 12 full regular seasons, so you're right..."
heat_forever,"Technically he said ""you ppl"""
heat_forever,"Andy will be a good backup for Mozgov, but I don't see how Thompson fits in with Mozgov/Andy/Love chewing up minutes at the PF/C position. Unless Andy is OK with being a third stringer at $10M or whatever he's getting."
heat_forever,This is the greatest game in Paul's life
heat_forever,"If you couldn't detect my sarcasm, my apologies."
heat_forever,Shaq just offered LeBron a role in Kazaam 2
heat_forever,CP3 is ahead in soul-crushing game 7 winning shot puts though.
heat_forever,"How did that dunk count, the buzzer went off and he was still trying to dunk it?"
heat_forever,Or a Kia jumps over Blake Griffin
heat_forever,"Agreed, I mean you get a 4th foul early in 3rd you have to sit that guy's ass."
heat_forever,Well if the Spurs wanted homecooking all they had to do was not rest players in November or beat the Pelicans.
heat_forever,Scottie instinctively grabs the part of his head Jordan smacked upside when he missed those layups in the 90's.
heat_forever,"If going to 9 Finals and winning only 5 was considered better than going 6 for 6, then Magic Johnson would be the GOAT. Sorry to burst your groupthink bubble."
heat_forever,Kyrie about to go out there and play in a suit
heat_forever,This time it should bounce up like 10 feet and then fall right in.
heat_forever,He even pissed off the OP by making it more than one sentence. Bravisimo!
heat_forever,"When Kyrie or Steph crossover Jordan in a Bulls uniform, then I'll be impressed."
heat_forever,That guy is laughing inside because he knows he could snap hibbert in two if he wanted to. But better to just take his money :)
heat_forever,"That's about once per game, so yes... he often had to take bad shot clock beating shots at least once per game."
heat_forever,Non-rookie options can only be in last year of contract. They eliminated all early opt-outs in 2011 CBA (other than rookie contracts with 2 team options).
heat_forever,he let the coach bang his mom
heat_forever,"I didn't downvote you. If the ball is over the cylinder and is interfered by the offensive team, it's offensive goaltending. Period. Full stop. There are other kinds of offensive goaltending (catching a shot in mid-air or blocking a shot that's past it's highest point) - that's what your rule is for."
heat_forever,Nasty 3 from Smith - soul crushing
heat_forever,A 62-win team should be winning by 20 against a team without it's 2 best players. This shouldn't be a contest at all.
heat_forever,"It's unbelievable Atlanta allowed Dellavedova to burrow so deeply into their psyche, took them out of their game."
heat_forever,Series over. Sorry Cleveland.
heat_forever,Cavs in 5
heat_forever,"If Howard elbowed Bogut, he would have been ejected. He smacked him with his hand, not as serious."
heat_forever,"They fouled Harden to get to Howard, lol"
heat_forever,"Joe ""Conference Finals Closer"" Harris"
heat_forever,If you watch carefully there's at least 1 Spur flopping on every play.
heat_forever,Cavs gonna find a way to fuck this up
heat_forever,Now the Cavs are going to stomp on the neck. 
heat_forever,"LeBron wants that third foul on Butler so bad, lol"
heat_forever,"And still somehow putting up 30-10-9 in a series, lol"
heat_forever,"So why did Breda ""hate"" Wilt - I suppose it has nothing to do with Wilt's obsession with stats and not fouling out. I didn't make up this narrative. I doubt you would accept Bill Simmons' research on this due to his Celtics bias, but at the same time, I can't trust your research on this due to your Wilt bias.

I am just repeating the story as I heard it that Wilt refused to foul out of a game (regardless if it was Game 7 of the Finals) and that Breda punished him for it and it cost Breda his job."
heat_forever,"Rose will never draw fouls because he's afraid of the contact inside, he always throws up floaters"
heat_forever,How about the 2nd pick then
heat_forever,"You realize LeBron has played against Dellavedova when LeBron was on the Heat? It's amazing how this ""bad rep"" developed over basically 4 games involving 2 teams about to be eliminated who had every intention of going to the Finals and running into the LeBron brick wall... 

A bad rep implies a multiple year history of this stuff...

Even Ron Artest/Metta World Peace/Panda Friend didn't get this much talk about his dirty plays and arena-clearing brawls."
heat_forever,"lol, even when things go wrong, they go so right for the Cavs"
heat_forever,You can't tell a joke and need to relax.
heat_forever,"Harden: ""Rick, if I asked you to do something... for the team... would you do anything I asked you to do?""

Nick: ""My name's Nick"""
heat_forever,Hawks - this is with Kyrie doing shit tonight...
heat_forever,"Every single time Jordan did this, they never give it."
heat_forever,The east isn't winning this year. Every remaining WC team is superior.
heat_forever,The problem the Hawks have is they have no idea who should be taking the last shots. Was that guy who clanked 2 critical shots on a 10-day contract?
heat_forever,"What money did Duncan leave on the table? Nobody in the NBA offered $12M for a 36 year old center other than the Spurs. Before age of 36, he got paid the max he could get for over a decade. So I don't understand this rhetoric - maybe if Duncan gave up some money during his playing career, he'd have won 10 rings. Who knows? 

But he didn't give up $1 his entire career, he was always paid exactly what he was worth."
heat_forever,Where's the technical for Bazemore?
heat_forever,"They already tried adding a team to Vancouver, it failed miserably and moved to Memphis."
heat_forever,"I agree. Nobody talks about how Delly got a forearm in the throat on an illegal pick from Taj and then was blindsided from behind with a two-arm shove sending him to the floor. Both bullshit and much worse plays from Taj THAT WENT COMPLETELY UNPUNISHED until Delly got Taj to kick him, which got the refs to LOOK at the play.

Then the second incident is ALL on Korver. He should have dove for the ball but he tried to avoid contact and instead got his ankle crushed. If he's not going for the ball, he should GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE DIVING AUSTRALIAN. It's what hustle is, when two players hustle, no one gets hurt. When one guy is hustling and the other guy is trying to dance around it, usually the dancing guy gets hurt.

The third incident is 100% on Horford. Delly got tripped into him, and then Horford admits he retaliated with intent to injure and then puts out a general warning that it will happen again if Delly doesn't learn...

At this point he should be suspended for the rest of the series just for the comments alone. They are disturbing."
heat_forever,"He's a mental midget, he's going to be worked over so easily by LeBron in the Finals to the point where he's going to get himself ejected."
heat_forever,"Well part of it is that the level of competition is better in the playoffs, also there are fewer inexperienced refs during the playoffs (and for worse, a lot more opinionated refs who like to exert control).

Not sure how to fix it but the playoffs/championships being rougher and less regulated is pretty common across all sports."
heat_forever,"We have 3 championships - including one over your salty ass team. Keep sulking, your tears are delicious."
heat_forever,I'm glad they don't sit you out during blows. I'd probably be sat out for the last 3 quarters every game.
heat_forever,"""Remember, it's always safe to call a timeout"""
heat_forever,Winning 2 in a row was good enough.
heat_forever,"Either JR is hot or everyone else is hot, pick your poison"
heat_forever,That one time he dropped 58 points on the Knicks buck naked.
heat_forever,"Every time Jordan dunked, a kitten died. When Jordan was informed of this, he joined the Slam Dunk competition."
heat_forever,"Eric Spoelstra won back-to-back rings and made the Finals 4 times in a row.

""What are things Popovich will never accomplish"""
heat_forever,"On Spurs being 6th seed because Portland was guaranteed top 4: ""That should be changed immediately""

http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/12809419/gregg-popovich-san-antonio-spurs-coach-wants-nba-change-playoff-seeding-procedure

How about just win your division and then you don't need to whine about it, Gregg"
heat_forever,LeBron has had a much easier road in the playoffs than other greats.
heat_forever,Wasn't wide-open and would have given up the rebound if he missed. A bad shot is still bad shot even if you make it.
heat_forever,"For Blake Griffin... it should be, but he's afraid of contact."
heat_forever,"That's funny, they called it earlier when Tristan fell on Taj Gibson's shoulders."
heat_forever,The kia would just get swallowed whole along with LeBron sleeping inside.
heat_forever,That will be one of the great GIFs of NBA history.
heat_forever,"So as long as you run nearby Howard and ""accidentally"" trip him, you can intentionally foul him anytime you want. It's always ""part of the play""."
heat_forever,"Refs call a lot of ticky tack fouls, they decide games this way."
heat_forever,The refs finally checked their MySpace.
heat_forever,Can Dunleavy draw 2 Flagrant 2's in one game?
heat_forever,It's gonna make money just from unaware people who think it's a GTA movie. They should have called Rock's character Seajay.
heat_forever,Of course LeBron hits his 10th 3 in 60 attempts
heat_forever,Thibs is gonna add to his necklace of meniscus 
heat_forever,"Well, the Replay Center is in the Secaucus office, but there's actually quite a significant NBA presence outside of the Replay Center, and a lot of NBA.com is developed and run from there as well. But you're right, the main HQ is in Manhattan with mostly the high-brow league executives."
heat_forever,Klay's going to show up for the game in that suit and proceed to average 37 points every quarter for 4 games straight.
heat_forever,"Almost every team has their own behind-the-scenes show and even if they don't, there's usually enough video taken from other sources to compile a DVD quite easily."
heat_forever,"The last time someone told MJ he wasn't good at 3s, he goes on to hit 6 in a row in the 92 Finals and basically destroyed any notion that Clyde Drexler was on his level."
heat_forever,"Then why does everyone in /r/nba shit on LeBron for going 2 for 5 in the Finals! Trust me, I know as a Heat fan that people were celebrating LeBron being a loser in the Finals for the third time."
heat_forever,6-0 (100% Finals win rate) is insanely more impressive... Dude NEVER lost a Finals series... Never tapped out... Never quit... In almost every Finals there were key moments where they were about to lose a game and somehow they won it. LeBron has failed 3 times already and mentally checked out at least twice. He can never really get over that stigma. 
heat_forever,"If you could care less, why didn't you"
heat_forever,"Punch is an automatic ejection, so no"
heat_forever,"In the 90's, I never understood how to look for this but I always loved when a guy was at the three point line jumping up and down pointing at his defender in the paint with one hand and the ref with his other hand begging for the call. Just felt like another tool refs had to control the game whenever they felt like awarding a tech free throw to the team behind."
heat_forever,"""Don't pass it to me, I'm wide open!"""
heat_forever,Calm down.
heat_forever,"Warriors vs Cavs. 

Bad Curry Shots vs LeBron ISO

Who will win?"
heat_forever,Plate block for bumping out the dents in Noah's face
heat_forever,"We will next year, don't worry buddy"
heat_forever,"Pick up LeBron when he opts-out too

Howard

LeBron

Durant

Harden

Westbrook

Good for at least 50 wins and 2nd round in the West."
heat_forever,He also wanted his personal doctor to be able to override the coach as to number of minutes he gets (because he claimed to get too anxious if he didn't get enough minutes or having to wait too long to get into the game)
heat_forever,"The Russell interview was great, letting his son score 2 points on him in one-on-one 3 years after he retired after leading 19-0... the only time he's touched a basketball since he retired."
heat_forever,Should be a 1 game suspension for sure.
heat_forever,It's LeBron they hate
heat_forever,"If it's a concussion, I believe protocol requires him to miss at least one game after this one... "
heat_forever,"""King James: Believe the Hype---The LeBron James Story"" pg. 86-88"
heat_forever,Pacers fans too
heat_forever,They won those in 2007.
heat_forever,He played better in 3 minutes than about 80% of the Hawks tonight
heat_forever,"Not this crap again, it costs $500k, nobody wanted to pay."
heat_forever,"No way Duncan and Ginobli were retiring after losing to the Heat. I don't remember one time anyone claiming those guys were retiring. They signed quickly because they knew already. 

This year... they don't really know. It will take some time.

What is it with Spurs fans and baseless insults they like to hurl? Learn how to class yourself up like the team you're a fan of. It might do you a world of good."
heat_forever,LeBron's whole body looks off when he shoots.
heat_forever,"Hahaha, NBA doesn't want two sweeps. "
heat_forever,Don't think the Clippers have gas for overtime.
heat_forever,"Oh my, LeBron is going for fiddy"
heat_forever,"Even refs don't understand it's on the tick to 15, not 16..."
heat_forever,Kill em baby
heat_forever,All Centers - interesting.
heat_forever,Those estimates account for blocks and steals missing by giving a higher weight to the existing stats (they use a different PER formula for old era). If blocks and steals were available then they'd just be put under the current formula and come up with a similar number.
heat_forever,"Just shitting on the Bulls now - good job Cavs, completely turned it around"
heat_forever,"It doesn't matter dude, refs jizz for the Spurs all the time and let them get away with anything."
heat_forever,And Spurs fans will call it a quadruple double.
heat_forever,"Check Jalen's cock, I bet there is red lipstick on it"
heat_forever,FUCKING CHRIS PAUL!
heat_forever,"""Hey yo, these ringless scrubs are crampin' my style."""
heat_forever,"Still, kind of surprising arenas don't have a fully functional medical facility."
heat_forever,Sucks to be an NBA player when you have no clue when you're going to get called for a foul or not - just totally random
heat_forever,"LeBron can never catch up to MJ, he's lost too many times in the Finals."
heat_forever,"And everyone played way more games per week too, lots of 3 in a rows that year due to the condensed schedule."
heat_forever,Of course LeBron with another classic almost triple double.
heat_forever,"LeBron has to carry the whole team again, I'm sure he's feeling good about that."
heat_forever,You're right and it probably would have saved Gibson from being ejected.
heat_forever,This is interesting stuff and I really feel bad for DeAndre Jordan as it seems like his form is good in that all of his shots seem straight on but too strong or too weak. I think if he just settled on a natural feeling amount of shot strength that he should really just step back 4-6 inches from the free throw line. He might just be too strong and trying to dial it back a bit doesn't work consistently enough.
heat_forever,"I'd say LeBron's last shot was game deciding, wouldn't you?"
heat_forever,I really don't think tickling someone's hair on a 3 after the ball is shot should ever be a foul. 
heat_forever,At least somebody is dunking for the Clippers
heat_forever,He can retire from OKC now to fulfill his pledge and then make a come back to the Wiz in October.
heat_forever,Not against an NBA defense
heat_forever,Didn't he just say a few weeks ago he wasn't leaving a championship-caliber team... Also it's funny how guys with so much experience get paid less than guys like Fisher and Kerr.
heat_forever,Mozgov: why no one ever hack-a-mozgov :(
heat_forever,I was expecting the free throw line superman dunk
heat_forever,Except they already had an NBA team and couldn't
heat_forever,"Damn man, Cavs just shitting on the Hawks"
heat_forever,Stern is folding the corner of the NY envelope as we speak
heat_forever,"Hahaha, the Hawks have had the BONUS since 9:47 left - what the fuck are you talking about"
heat_forever,"Yet baseball is quite profitable for the owners even with a salary cap. There's no salary cap in the real world, and billionaires police themselves from giving away money quite well without any help from anyone. 

Salary caps should be abolished and players should earn what they are capable of earning. If an owner can't figure that out and overpays until he bankrupts himself, that's his problem. He can just say no when someone asks for more money. It's rather simple."
heat_forever,LeBron tears another ACL - will it take one break or two to recover
heat_forever,Where's the goaltending - the Warriors knocked the ball away on its way down during the continuation
heat_forever,Then why didn't he shoot 9 more to end up 8/12 same as JR?
heat_forever,http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18sjypnc1wiifgif/ku-xlarge.gif
heat_forever,Finally an offensive rebound
heat_forever,You never go full Noah
heat_forever,Popcorn Vendor LeBron was sad at missing out on overtime sales.
heat_forever,"""The long haul"" is until the end of his contract which he can choose to be now or end of next year."
heat_forever,I'm not a professional basketball player - apparently neither is Blake Griffin.
heat_forever,I don't think it should be a foul but they call the high-five foul long after shot is off almost every single time.
heat_forever,"How many of them are 6'8"", 250 lbs"
heat_forever,"Delly is the glue keeping this team together, checking up on JR"
heat_forever,"I remember in his earlier Cavs days when LeBron was high-stepping from the inbound, he was cranking a 3 guaranteed."
heat_forever,"""he's a bad ass motherfucker, Lisa Salters, hide yo' kids, hide yo' ass, Delly gonna fuck it all"""
heat_forever,I thought it was going to be a picture of LelBron swatting Atlanta's hopes and dreams away
heat_forever,Fouling before the inbounds is 2 immediate free throws and keep possession.
heat_forever,Blake has worse FT form than Jordan but he hits them way more often.
heat_forever,All I know is ESPN and TNT are gonna be pissed.
heat_forever,Hiding razor blades in his bald spot
heat_forever,Amazing that he already knows the results of the Friday morning neurologist exam a day before!
heat_forever,"They do, the Trail Blazers won the most games in their division. If other teams wanted the same reward, they just had to win their division."
heat_forever,"So the refs missed the timeout, the same way they missed Noah's foul - which led to LeBron sticking it. Everyone goes home happy."
heat_forever,Did LeBron spit on Noah?
heat_forever,That's what Lance thought and he cost the Pacers 3 games by himself last year.
heat_forever,They should have stopped the game to review it
heat_forever,"Is anyone really watching undercard fights, the real fight won't be until much later."
heat_forever,They knew they were tied right? You didn't need a 3?
heat_forever,LeBron definitely made a deal with the devil.
heat_forever,"""Hey Kevin, bet you can't clap behind your back"""
heat_forever,"He always tries to super jam it instead of just getting the points, he's a mental midget."
heat_forever,"Paul still looks gimpy, but if he can make his shot"
heat_forever,LeBron: heyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyheyhey
heat_forever,"Carroll is useless out there, should have sat out"
heat_forever,"If Cavs win game 1, Cavs in 5 otherwise Cavs in 6."
heat_forever,He shouldn't have admitted that.
heat_forever,Because they pay $6k a ticket and the NBA is all about that cash money
heat_forever,"At least they admit when they are wrong - the Atlanta announcers are probably just going ""hmm, err, well, you can't really tell on that angle"""
heat_forever,"I checked it and it's the receiving team who cannot be over-the-cap apron (about $4m above the actual cap) at the conclusion of the trade. I'm not sure what Portland's situation is, or if it applies.

http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q23

""Starting in 2013-14, teams cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade transaction (see question number 91) if their team salary is above the apron at the conclusion of the trade."""
heat_forever,"If it was a quadruple double, then show me the box score to confirm it. Or do we simply ignore facts nowadays."
heat_forever,The Orlando Magic would like to have an interview with you
heat_forever,"Garnett started before rookie salaries and max salaries were a thing so he was grandfathered in and was able to make more than the ""max"" for a number of years. Duncan just missed that, but Duncan made every penny he was eligible for until he was 36."
heat_forever,Jordan faced great defenses also. He didn't shit the bed though.
heat_forever,Those GS team doctors should be fired.
heat_forever,"Surprise Starting Lineup:

5 - Haywood

4 - LeBron

3 - Marion

2 - Miller

1- Perk
"
heat_forever,"If Kyrie can actually slap together a 50% game, the Cavs will win easily."
heat_forever,Also he shoots 70% which means he rarely takes bad shots - look at guys like Roy Hibbert who can barely make a shot inside 5 feet and then bricks all day from 15 feet away and has zero athleticism... He's getting paid $15.5M next year. I'd say Jordan is worth more than that.
heat_forever,This series is over. There's no more miracles left.
heat_forever,"Golden State takes such terrible shots, but they go in, so who can blame them."
heat_forever,"Perfect timeout, crowd already petering out before the commercial even started."
heat_forever,"""I knew I shouldn't have agreed to do these commercials live!"""
heat_forever,I feel like Green will try to get in LeBron's head too much and fail and all of his moving screens are probably going to be called causing him to get frustrated.
heat_forever,"Lakers have their own Lakers channel that Time Warner pays billions per year for - they fill it up with tons of footage, I would say they probably give the most behind-the-scenes access to their players out of any team."
heat_forever,LeBron almost tore an ACL with that celebration
heat_forever,"You mean foul him all the way up the court with no call, then turn around and call a touch foul when someone breathes on Manu"
heat_forever,AND ONE BABY
heat_forever,"""Yeah sure, just drive home on the highway Klay. I'm your doctor, TRUST ME"""
heat_forever,"Calm down, you're getting angry."
heat_forever,"LeBron doesn't give one shit about Cleveland, he only cares about Akron, and he lived there already while playing for the Heat. He only returned to Cleveland because he felt the Heat couldn't improve anymore. If Cleveland didn't have the pieces for a championship in place, he would never have returned there, or he'd go to a different team that had the pieces."
heat_forever,"If people don't think team doctors work for the team, this is yet more proof. "
heat_forever,How many times did LeBron face championship-winning teams in the first round again?
heat_forever,Ref trying out for the rockettes
heat_forever,"Kenny is full of shit, Delly is the only guy who's diving for balls, he's not giving a shit if there's people in the way, he just wants the ball."
heat_forever,"yeah but it's college bball, come on."
heat_forever,Now for a Rivers 18-0 run
heat_forever,"Do you want ice cream?

... yes"
heat_forever,"""Micha Jorda is da bess evuh"""
heat_forever,Bird rights... 
heat_forever,Why do guys like this always act completely surprised by this reaction? There's a thousand other players who aren't pricks across all sports who fans respect and admire even if they aren't on their team... but it's the same bunch of thugs who seem to get spit on and have things thrown on them. Maybe they should look themselves in the mirror and ask why they can't just be the kind of player that fans would respect instead of despise. It's just easier to be lazy and succumb to the whims of the baser emotions.
heat_forever,"If reporters asked these kind of questions Pop would give a sneer and give a snarky response. I've found that the better the question asked, the snarkier Popovich gets because he likes to think he's so smart, no one else can see the things like he can."
heat_forever,"Golden State Warriors coach is thinking ""goddamn pussy, get out there and fucking win this game"""
heat_forever,"And when the audio guy remembers to push the ""crowd cheering"" sound effect button."
heat_forever,"Love is very good at getting gimme uncontested rebounds. He rarely rips defensive rebounds away from stronger players (though sometimes he does). Where he lacks the most is offensive rebounding. Every single one TT gets is a soul-crushing embarrassment for the other team. When it turns into 3 points, TT should get some kind of credit for creating those points out of thin air.

TT also doesn't cost anything on the offensive side, he gets easy putbacks sometimes but he doesn't need shots. LeBron/Kyrie/JR are happy taking more shots. Love cranked up way too many bricks from 3.

Love needs to be the first option to be effective, and so he won't stay on the Cavs."
heat_forever,"You'd better hope so, but no way the Cavs get past the next round without Kyrie and Love."
heat_forever,"Wilt wouldn't be quite as dominant in the 80s and 90s and Jordan would have been in the 60s and 70s. And yet Jordan managed to win 6 rings against fiercer competition while Wilt only won 2. 

Granted Wilt had to deal with the Celtics who were running an all-star team compared to the rest of the league thanks to territorial drafting rights (being able to claim any college player from the northeast with no competition)."
heat_forever,"Bazemore's biggest achievement is being a third-rate Lance Stephenson, LeBron has bigger goals in mind."
heat_forever,Atlanta played their best ball and still only came up with a tie... even with a busted up Kyrie doing nothing.
heat_forever,"Sitting by the phone, waiting for that first ring..."
heat_forever,He was holding out for a better contract
heat_forever,Clippers want to play the maximum number of games possible apparently
heat_forever,maybe not the smartest time to make this joke
heat_forever,More like they aren't putting in the effort.
heat_forever,"Seriously, it should be just bodies crashing into the paint every play from here on out."
heat_forever,That looks like it has no hope of going in because it seems like he's on his way down... but he's still on his way up!
heat_forever,"Which is why you got swept, with thinking like that."
heat_forever,"Cavs have this, Bulls played again one of their best quarters ever and find themselves losing. They can barely keep up with the Cavs."
heat_forever,I just find the groupthink to be fascinating around here. People are so afraid to go against the groupthink.
heat_forever,"Still not over 2013 are you?

While we're ignoring box scores, why not just discount Ray Allen's shot and just give Duncan 6 rings."
heat_forever,"""Told y'all jum shas don win champiashits. Just turrble, Ernuh, turrble."""
heat_forever,"He should be doing it every game, not just 1 game."
heat_forever,"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!

"
heat_forever,"Just a bunch of Spurs fans revealing how ""classy"" they are."
heat_forever,"If the Spurs wanted a better seeding, they just have learn how to win their division. Just like DeAndre should learn how to shoot free throws. The rules are the rules. Don't blame Portland for taking advantage of the rules."
heat_forever,"Then this would have been a Flagrant 10 - there's no valid basketball reason anyone should shove a person in the back with both arms. If Dellevedova fell the wrong way, that's a concussion or worse."
heat_forever,And it'll be an actual working bong too
heat_forever,"He never bitched about anything. I heard more bitching from the Spurs about being the 6th seed and how the rules should change. Why the fuck should the rules change because a handful of lazy teams can't be bothered to win their division, a fundamental weakness in their game?"
heat_forever,"In true LeBron fashion, he'll miss it by 0.1 assists or so if he doesn't come back"
heat_forever,"Clippers have zero strategy right now, Blake is just shooting every 18 footer he sees... won't last"
heat_forever,He might be done for the game though. ATL has to cut it to like 12 to draw him out
heat_forever,"Spoelstra was the coach, so yes, he took them to the Finals. LeBron spent 7 years in Cleveland and made the Finals only once, so he's not some magic Finals man. Wade and Bosh were also responsible.

But if you're right, LeBron will coast past the Bulls and the ECF and get to the Finals again. Give your team some credit man, or just unflair already since you have a hard-on for LeBron."
heat_forever,"Are you forgetting the cap raises $30 million next year and continues rising at a faster pace than ever before? 

All the cap problems will be gone and having your 3 core players locked up for at least 4 more years under the current CBA max is going to be a massive advantage."
heat_forever,Because he owns the Hornets??? 
heat_forever,It's a concussion
heat_forever,Haven't seen either of them will their team to victory on one leg though...
heat_forever,"Clippers just have too many players with low BBIQ, they need to look into replacing Barnes and getting some value for Jordan on a sign-and-trade or something."
heat_forever,"Terrible half for Houston, just lucky the Warriors also had a terrible half."
heat_forever,I don't get why 14 teams get an early summer vacation (and then every loser in the playoffs). They should be forced to sit in a study hall and allowed to do nothing until the playoffs are done!
heat_forever,"In the past Rondo shot like shit on purpose so that his defender backed off which gave him a ton of space to operate as a pass-first point guard. Of course, it went to shit this year because he also forgot how to shoot free throws, but it was completely intentional in the past."
heat_forever,He has to get a triple double out of Scottie Pippen
heat_forever,How can Delly step on the line when he floats 6 inches off the ground
heat_forever,How was that ref able to keep a straight face
heat_forever,And then you catch just the barest glimpse of a smirk on his face as you black out in pain.
heat_forever,T up Popovich to teach him a lesson.
heat_forever,How the fuck is Chris Paul not on the sidebar... 
heat_forever,"lol, he fell before LeBron even touched him"
heat_forever,"Hey, come on. Give the guy some credit now."
heat_forever,"If the ball is loose, everyone has a right to dive for it. Usually the ones standing and trying to avoid contact are who get hurt. Korver could have easily run away if he didn't want to get hurt (the same way he did when LeBron dunked at the end of game 2). Korver is the one who didn't want to be in that scrum, and he paid for it. If he just got on the floor, then he either gets the ball or gets out without being injured."
heat_forever,"It's actually 9.25 right now, he'd need to get 10 assists and he's 3 short."
heat_forever,Waste all your fouls on nonsense hacking then he gets a 6th on a silly loose ball foul.
heat_forever,you had to make it weird
heat_forever,"Nothing really happened there, should just be side out for Cavs"
heat_forever,"He's had a good run with Duncan, Ginobli and Parker. Mostly Duncan though. Once that's over, 50 wins isn't going to be so automatic anymore."
heat_forever,"These refs are just looking for fouls to call, so lame"
heat_forever,Because it's the Spurs and they should be allowed to foul whenever they want if it gives them an advantage. AMIRITE
heat_forever,"If he said that, he's a reckless doctor. Derrick Rose busted his knee up with no contact twice, anything can happen out there. "
heat_forever,"He didn't get a flagrant 2 for kicking, he got a flagrant 2 for two arm shoving Dellevedova in the back "
heat_forever,"Wilt was ""benched"" by Butch van Breda Kolff for playing soft with 5 fouls in Game 7 of 1969 Finals. Wilt blamed it on knee problems, but it was really because he didn't want to foul out. 

When the game was almost lost, Wilt finally relented to go back in but the coach kept him out as punishment and lost (then resigned after taking the heat for punishing Wilt for quitting after getting his 5th foul).

It is well documented that Wilt had an aversion to fouling out and did anything to avoid it... guy never fouled out in his ENTIRE career."
heat_forever,Welcome to the faded flairs club.
heat_forever,Kawhi on Paul is just a waste of Kawhi's talents. Paul won't hold the ball long.
heat_forever,"I see now why the Warriors team doctors are under constant pressure to rubber-stamp concussion tests. All these public statements when nobody actually knows the truth - unless I see a statement from the NBA's head concussion doctor, I have to assume anyone connected to the Warriors is flat-out lying after their comedy of errors with this situation."
heat_forever,"Manu: ""Never look when you pass Kawhi, NEVER LOOOOOOK"""
heat_forever,"If LeBron twists his leg in that same leg lock, Heinrich's legs will snap off at the knee."
heat_forever,Shumpert fouled too
heat_forever,Technical foul on J.R. Smith
heat_forever,Duncan got paid the absolute max he could from age 25 to 36... so enough with this bullshit rhetoric.
heat_forever,Steph took 4 steps to make that layup
heat_forever,Maybe he should learn how to box out.
heat_forever,"I don't think he's massively overrated defensively. He absolutely gets blocks, changes shots and persuades people to not drive on him. It's a big advantage. Better to get him now when his athleticism will last for 4-5 years. He will have a tough time in the league when that's gone though."
heat_forever,"Reggie is the absolutely worst basketball personality on the planet and it's sickening he's allowed the forums he's given without earning it. He was a cheap player, a perennial loser who couldn't win a ring and his main claim to fame is arguing with Spike Lee. He hates superstars like LeBron because he himself was consistently overshadowed and beaten by a superstar named Michael Jordan. He's probably had sick fantasies of injuring Jordan and winning a title because of it, and so he gets off on seeing players try to take out LeBron (WHAT A GOOD HARD FOUL, IT'S A PLAYOFF FOUL, COME ON MAN, YOU GOTTA LET THEM PLAY) but as soon as a white guy Dellavedova hustles for a loose ball... he's a dirty player."
heat_forever,"It's the classic ""abandon what got you here"" vs ""stay the course and if you lose, maybe they were just better"" dilemma

Tough spot to be in, but if the 67 wins were legit, they would be dictating the series..."
heat_forever,"He drew the foul, if he tried to lay it up, guaranteed miss - LeBron should learn something from him"
heat_forever,"How the fuck is LeBron doing this, even I'm impressed and I've seen him do a lot. This is a 45-15 type of game."
heat_forever,JR Smith - garbage GOAT
heat_forever,"JVG: ""I mean come on, who hasn't come home and gotten tired of their family's shit once in a while? Makes you want to double-tap them to get some peace and quiet! He's just doing what any normal married guy is dreaming of, don't blame him for actually having the guts to do it! There should be a rule that you get to kill your family when you've had enough of them. I mean who wouldn't want that? Don't tell me it can't be done. It's exactly what I would do!""

Breen: ""Puts a whole new meaning to BANG!""

Jackson: ""Jesus Christ, Lord God As My Witness, You've Gone Off The Deep End, Mr. Van Gundy. I Am Ashamed."""
heat_forever,"But you'd never be considered an all-nba player if you only play half the games, so he'd never be able to build up that reputation in the first place."
heat_forever,Clippers are going to use CP3's injury to rally
heat_forever,Mirotic will hit like 3 3's in the final minute to close it within 1
heat_forever,Hawks have no shits left to give.
heat_forever,"Basketball gods weren't standing for any more Spurs bullshit, lol"
heat_forever,63 comments for an ECF game. Atlanta is like the bubonic plague.
heat_forever,Cavs just chewing that clock off in big ol chunks
heat_forever,I've seen Durant go down the court and take 10 steps with the ball spinning on top of his hand like a plate he's about to serve on roller blades and it never gets called.
heat_forever,"Howard always gets himself ejected from playoff game blowouts, he's too cool to waste his time."
heat_forever,Mark Jackson is chuckling at home.
heat_forever,Sounds like typical /r/nba thread
heat_forever,"He was about to blame it on the refs (he goes ""they got this advantage from the ref... replay review"") but didn't want to be the first announcer to get a 50k fine from the NBA."
heat_forever,It only matters what the NBA thinks and they don't take very well to players making veiled threats using gang terminology.
heat_forever,Dude is dead
heat_forever,Spurs tried it twice this year and got fucked both times.
heat_forever,Or if Noah was called for his foul on LeBron.
heat_forever,"Pushing on a layup is bullshit - should be a flagrant every time. You got beat, don't take out your frustration by trying to injure someone."
heat_forever,"There's a whole other quarter of this shit, Atlanta should just forfeit."
heat_forever,"So... flying was the issue then? If it's a non-issue, then get on the damn plane, lol"
heat_forever,"There's a reason why Schroeder was benched the entire second half of the Atlanta game, he wanted to retaliate against Delly and Coach Bud had the foresight to plant his ass on the bench to avoid that."
heat_forever,"So why did they rest players in November? 

Or not take New Orleans seriously?

If it was in their hands to get a 2 seed, why didn't they get it?"
heat_forever,"I don't see the part where Delly grabbed Horford's leg and then twisted his body to make it come out of it's socket. If you saw that, post the video."
heat_forever,"""Come on @KingJames, only 1.3 BPG? Really? #noeffort"" - NBA2K Twitter Fan"
heat_forever,This is probably what he tells his players also - too bad they don't listen.
heat_forever,"Then call the foul on Noah for grabbing TT's arm, lol"
heat_forever,He can't look himself in the mirror unless he sabotages his teams chances for success.
heat_forever,He's refusing to shoot the entire game... we're all watching the same game right?
heat_forever,"NFL football is like that. Coaches can decline the penalty if it disadvantages them. It only makes sense to me. A foul should always benefit the team being fouled. The coach should have final say on whether he wants it or not.

The only difference is the foul should still count against the other team even if it's declined, to discourage further fouling.

The whole purpose of fouls is to promote a clean, professional and fair game, otherwise they wouldn't bother with them and let it be an all-out scrum."
heat_forever,\#blakers
heat_forever,"Kids aren't exactly 50/50 of their parents, sometimes it's 90/10."
heat_forever,"""We've secretly switched LeBron's team with the New York Knicks, let's see how he reacts..."""
heat_forever,"I'm still here - blows a hole in your theory hmm

All I saw in that game thread was how you guys wanted Parker shot and thrown off the team just because he had 1 bad game. We've seen Wade have a bad game before, but we still supported him. 

Of course, like I said, those were fair weather Spurs fans - they've changed their flairs by now. Probably Clippers fans now. HAHAHA"
heat_forever,actually Love was the one with the awkward looking smile wearing the hat he didn't really earn :)
heat_forever,Delly is trying to give the Hawks extra time
heat_forever,Give the Cavs a little credit - they beat the NBA
heat_forever,"But Phil won 11 in 18 years - if he had the Spurs, he'd probably win 9 or 10 in those same 15 years. Popovich has cost the Spurs at least 3 or 4 championships with bad coaching which everyone seems to disregard."
heat_forever,"Smith is the only one getting calls, it's like some sick joke from the refs. They aren't calling anything else."
heat_forever,"Sabonis was the biggest what-if though, he was holding his own quite well during a center-strong era as an out-of-shape 35 year old and was an unheard-of stretch 5 back then. If he was in the NBA in his prime, he could have been one of the greats."
heat_forever,"I've watched plenty of games and he stagnates the offense when they are obviously trying to get him going (just about every first quarter). And if he's not scoring, he pretty much gives up on defense.

Next year he should really come off the bench or they should just trade him for two more solid bench pieces and start TT."
heat_forever,So if LeBron is the best and Skip-trained 52-year-old Jordan whips him in 1-on-1 does that make Jordan the best?
heat_forever,DA TRUTH
heat_forever,"Time has nothing to do with it, it's 100% to do with the teams involved. 

During the 90's, regular season Bulls games on Sunday at 1pm (NBA on NBC!) used to pull in 10+ rating (at a time when about 50M less people lived in the US)."
heat_forever,"Gortat fouling out is a blessing, he single-handedly fucked the Wizards"
heat_forever,You're a 62 win team and the Cavs are missing two of their best players... it should be a 20 point lead right now.
heat_forever,"Yes, from your head, not your ear."
heat_forever,He's gotta look good to prospective employers.
heat_forever,I expect a retaliation flagrant on LeBron
heat_forever,"Shortly before his Wizards comeback in 2001, Jordan hosted a few of his famous summer games to help himself get back into shape. Mostly NBA players as well as 16-year old LeBron attended. LeBron was destroying legit NBA players at age 16..."
heat_forever,"Faulty logic, if he was making every free throw, he wouldn't get all those attempts."
heat_forever,So... Kyrie sits the rest of the way? He got his taste and the game is over.
heat_forever,I'm utterly dumbfounded at how people think someone has 100% control to plan malicious activities with their flailing body while falling down.
heat_forever,"I do remember reading about a group of people who scoured old radio broadcasts and studied microfiche of old newspaper clips looking for confirmed data on blocks and steals prior to the 70's. 

It would be great if OP could get those 112 games updated on basketball reference if he has concrete proof of the blocks and steals stats (though I'm not sure they would take it since it's not NBA official).

It's a shame all that data is lost. Baseball always took stats way more seriously. "
heat_forever,"I've always said, and been downvoted for saying, a championship team should run their offense they've been running all year (and for multiple years) and win on better execution than anyone else. As soon as you fall prey to gimmicks and tricks you don't really practice - then you are falling into desperation and turning your back on your mantra of a system. 

Popovich wouldn't stand for any of his players going rogue and doing something completely out of the ordinary. So why should the players stand for Popovich going rogue on strategy? 

The worst part is when he orders hall-of-fame players like Duncan and Parker to be foul bitches. That has to stick in their craw even a little bit even if they won't admit it. You have goons on the bench like Baynes who should be doing that."
heat_forever,WELL THAT'S ANOTHER BUZZER BEATER FOR LELBRON
heat_forever,"I mean he made it, but taking a 30 foot shot doesn't seem like a smart play really."
heat_forever,Manu is the foul bitch this time
heat_forever,Review that shit you dumb fuck refs
heat_forever,"""Push through the pain"" *stares straight at Rose in a suit*"
heat_forever,There's more players in the NBA who don't want to play with scrubs like Dudley than don't want to play with Kobe.
heat_forever,"Any points from Dellevedova should be an insult to the Bulls, lol"
heat_forever,$200k a minute
heat_forever,"Shaq &amp; Wade were there for a year under Stan Van Gundy. Riley thought Van Gundy wasn't coaching them properly, so he fired him, took over and won a ring. That's a fucking great coach and one of the reasons I put Riley over Popovich. I guarantee you Popovich can't take over any random team and win a ring with them in that same year.

Jackson, Auerbach, Riley, Popovich."
heat_forever,"Cap goes up $30M after next year and will be around $50M higher in 5 years.

Better to lock up your stars now with the old cap... that will be a massive advantage compared to teams signing big free-agents after next offseason (LeBron will be making close to $40M a year)."
heat_forever,Unbelievable how bad he's injured - I think Kevin Love could do a better job out there if he was on the court.
heat_forever,It must limit his mobility
heat_forever,"If Paul gets even one shot to drop, he's likely to hit his next 4"
heat_forever,"""I got da yayo, meng"""
heat_forever,"Kobe could do that, except in half the time."
heat_forever,Now time for someone to end a Cavs player's season in this Hunger Games playoffs.
heat_forever,"Kenny: That dirty motherfucker dellavedova!

Chuck: Mmm, bahamas.

Shaq: I have 4 rings, Kenny's got 2 rings, Chuck's got yellow speedos.

Ernie: 10 more years of this shit..."
heat_forever,"Kyrie looks done for the series, so maybe the series just flipped again. Sorry Cavs, you can't catch a break!"
heat_forever,Why is no one talking about Bogut's two-arm shove on Howard?
heat_forever,"Spurs did it when they were winning and they still lost. It's a loser's gimmick - stick to the gameplan that got you to the playoffs and trust in your system. Once a coach abandons the system, he is abandoning his players."
heat_forever,"Turner is paying the NBA 3x and paying these guys probably 3x, the REAL winner must be Turner who's raking in the REAL cash."
heat_forever,Houston only has to win by 1
heat_forever,He's the only player in the history of the NBA who's built like a bodybuilder but moves like a cat. Use your brain man.
heat_forever,"The point is, nobody cares what scrubs like Dudley says. He's talking out of his ass. If he got traded to the Lakers, suddenly he'd be the biggest Kobe ass-kisser out there. His opinions are useless."
heat_forever,"This is absolutely a LeBron 45-15 type of game, but he will get shit on for taking 36 shots for 35 points."
heat_forever,Dellavedova is completely owning Teague's little brain
heat_forever,He should hire Rajon Rondo as his free throw shooting coach
heat_forever,"Haha, only Duncan is allowed to jump and land and draw a jump ball"
heat_forever,They are amputating his leg so he can come back
heat_forever,That's a foul!
heat_forever,Who want to sex Haywood
heat_forever,"Game 7 ad revenues are usually through the roof, so they milk every ounce of it."
heat_forever,"I kind of wish players were required to do a combine type physical at the beginning of every season. They'd never do it because it would map out exactly when their athleticism is beginning to fail and affect their earning potential, but would be interesting for sports science to know how an elite athlete progresses."
heat_forever,How is that not a foul when you bowl over someone
heat_forever,"Won't be a game 4 for him if the NBA does their job.

He admits he was being malicious and tried to seriously injure him, then he says that Dellavedova better ""watch out"" because the ""brotherhood"" will teach him a lesson.

Guy is straight thuggin' on national TV."
heat_forever,"I'd imagine losing Duncan and Ginobli and facing a losing season would qualify as ""stopped being fun""."
heat_forever,"Joey with the standing 8 count, seems responsive"
heat_forever,Why did all the Washington players just stand there and let it happen?
heat_forever,"Pop is the Royce White of retarded neckbeards, the ultimate redditor."
heat_forever,9.9*
heat_forever,He's going to be dealing with this all playoffs... unless it's just a tweak that will heal but I don't think he will have much time to recover.
heat_forever,Harden's teammates don't even want to pass it to him anymore. It's done
heat_forever,What a flop
heat_forever,Bill covering cars and Clarkson doing NBA
heat_forever,All that while calling a tech 
heat_forever,"LeBron won't win anymore championships, so he'll cherish his 2 from the Heat. Forever."
heat_forever,"I think Love screws up the Cavs more than he helps. Unless he's giving a TT like performance on the offensive glass and hitting 3's, he feels like a liability on the court and TT's offensive rebounding is soul crushing to an opponent. You can feel the collective gasp of exasperation everytime he comes out of a crowd of 4 players with the ball. Love just can't do that."
heat_forever,"Flopping gets fouls, so why not flop?"
heat_forever,A-Capela just hit the alley doo-wop.
heat_forever,"Shoot him in the head, that will delay him for a full timeout"
heat_forever,Atlanta fans would be cheering saying Delly deserved it.
heat_forever,Cavs barely got out alive with this one.
heat_forever,Would you trade Harden for him?
heat_forever,I think most people on an internet forum have never had to or bothered to exert themselves beyond their limits. So they can't fathom that someone would or could do that.
heat_forever,"They were hosting the TNT upfronts last night which is a trade event where they show off next year's shows to potential advertisers. They want to be able to assure advertisers that the Inside crew is coming back, so this was done already, and announced during that event."
heat_forever,Those nanobots fixed LeBron's ankle fast
heat_forever,Kerr's gonna ask his friend Michael Jordan to join and finally get his revenge punch.
heat_forever,"[When you look at his bare feet](http://www.hoopmixtape.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LeBrons-Feet.png), his toes are pointing up on his foot and only his big toe touches the floor. So he has a weird running gait because of it. 

Supposedly it's because his family couldn't afford new shoes at the rate he was growing so his toes kind of got crushed as kid. Poor LeBron."
heat_forever,"This is why basketball referees will never be taken seriously, you can't even learn the game from them when they are so inconsistent."
heat_forever,"During the playoffs, regular timeouts are lengthened to squeeze in more commercials. Also there are enforced timeouts for commercials (usually called television timeouts or referee timeouts) that are charged to alternating teams I believe if they don't take it themselves."
heat_forever,"As if the Spurs don't abuse every home court advantage they possibly can.

Fact is, Popovich pissed 3 games away and the series was really 6-1."
heat_forever,"Check back in 2 games, when it's over."
heat_forever,Doc should have called time out to get Jordan in at 1:59.
heat_forever,Jordan just wants to fuck around and drop 30 a night on some fools again
heat_forever,Mike Conley Eyepatches
heat_forever,It's time to shoot Noah between the eyes behind the barn
heat_forever,"Watch carefully, this is how Golden State will look playing Cleveland's defense."
heat_forever,"I mean we wait 2 weeks for the Super Bowl every year, I think there should be a 2 week gap before the Finals regardless - want to see 2 fresh as possible teams go at it."
heat_forever,"""Let's give the Spurs another minute to win this"""
heat_forever,"This last play wasn't a travel because he maintained his dribble, but him sliding on his ass 15 feet with the ball and then pitching it out is most certainly a travel in every basketball league on the planet."
heat_forever,Donald Sterling was the most powerful person in the world? Wut
heat_forever,What's there to address? You wanted the refs to award the game to the Spurs right then and there? Spurs could have changed their play if they wanted to.
heat_forever,Josh Smith reveals his true nature
heat_forever,"Yes, every weight listed on there is from the only official time they get weighed, their rookie year. LeBron is listed at 240 when he's closer to 260 now."
heat_forever,"This just in, LeBron doesn't understand the physics of a 260 pound man flying through the air imparting force onto an air-filled basketball."
heat_forever,Manu never fails to make a dumb foul when he gets beat
heat_forever,LeBron's got his stinkface going
heat_forever,"Every time LeBron plays the Bulls, the Bulls do something stupid to torpedo the series. For some reason, they become mental midgets around LeBron and let their thuggish behavior get the best of them. Cost them so many series already.

Nazr's push on LeBron, Gibson getting 2 techs in 2 seconds as he cursed out a ref and threatened to kill him, Gibson flagrantly fouling Delly, Noah losing his cool every other play. 

Thibs realized this and put a ban on whining this game but still, the Bulls can get the better of their nature. Time to dismantle the team."
heat_forever,"he's never been a high flyer, that's why he has a PhD in backboard english."
heat_forever,Why the fuck is Howard always looking for Smith on the inbounds
heat_forever,Another casualty on Jordan's throne of crushed dreams
heat_forever,Well there won't be any more nights unless they waste all their juice
heat_forever,"Well, most people watching this game don't follow the league daily and would be impressed by that."
heat_forever,"That's the real question, probably because they are the most fraudulent 60-win team in NBA history."
heat_forever,only Kobe would properly punctuate his hashtag
heat_forever,Refs are in full fuck the Clippers lockdown - sorry Clippers fans!
heat_forever,"What took you so long, LeBron - plus, you left that kitten stuck in the tree. "
heat_forever,"No he's an idiot when he's an idiot - I'm glad people are seeing it more clearly now that he's often the reason why they lose. If he was as smart as people think he is, the Spurs would be sporting 10-12 championships - including 2013."
heat_forever,"LeBron has two hands on the ball and pulls Dunleavey to the floor by holding the ball and somehow that's a reach, lol"
heat_forever,I doubt it - Connect 4 is a solved game where playing perfect moves with first move guarantees you'll never lose... Rondo never let the other player go first unless it's a kid.
heat_forever,"I think if Jordan's flu game happened today, everyone here would call him a lame primadonna bitch for being sick."
heat_forever,Nah it's set right
heat_forever,He'd have to play 13 out of a possible 14 games. It would suck if he did all that and got no ring.
heat_forever,"lol, was that an offensive interference from Mozgov, ball was kind of sitting on the rim, hahaha"
heat_forever,Iguodala was offsides though
heat_forever,"He should have won in 2004 and 2008.

If the CP3 trade went through, Lakers probably would have easily won in 2011. Kobe would have never gotten his achilles injured chasing the playoffs in 2013. 

At this point Kobe would have 8 rings including 4 in a row while still maintaining great stats well into his 30's and having a strong team to finish his career with. Phil Jackson would probably stay on as coach  avoiding the debacles of Mike Brown, D'Antoni and Byron Scott (and Phil Jackson in NY)."
heat_forever,"""Prigioni is such a dirty player, going after Klay's legs like that!"" - Hawks Fans"
heat_forever,What's this? The Spurs not getting all the calls? The refs need to check their Google+.
heat_forever,"You know, all his life Delly was probably the biggest baddest dude in his circle of friends, probably banged all the hot aussie chicks with the thickest mustaches. But he gets to the NBA and he's this scrappy little kid."
heat_forever,Greatest sequel this year easily.
heat_forever,"""head contusion"""
heat_forever,He was disappointed LeBron didn't deep dick him hard enough.
heat_forever,"Refs get bored too, want to practice all their finger signals"
heat_forever,Did anyone check to make sure Steve Ballmer is still alive
heat_forever,"ESPN - I turn off the TV immediately after a game.

TNT - I leave the TV on indefinitely after a game."
heat_forever,"Except he can't shoot, he has zero lift, can't defend and he can't even hit a free throw right now. Guy is completely useless. Let him play like 6 minutes for his pride then bench him the rest of the game. Might as well play Mike Miller if you want a guy who has zero lift and can't defend, but at least he can get on a JR-like three point barrage."
heat_forever,They never called goaltend though or the points would have been added already.
heat_forever,Gibson committed 3 separate flagrant fouls on Dellavedova that one play... just a bunch of thugs on that team.
heat_forever,I'd say J-Kidd on the Knicks - he basically lifted that team to 50 wins that one year. Too bad he completely flamed out in the playoffs going 0-18 on his final 18 shots.
heat_forever,"Why would he give up 2 years of salary when he can go to any team and get a max for 2 years and then a super-max 2 years from now (assuming he keeps up his performance). 

This Spurs team without Duncan and Ginobli won't be in any condition to contend for championships anyway, he'd just be on a worse team that he's on now. Might as well stay in Portland."
heat_forever,What a HORRIBLE shot by Kyrie but mofo makes it
heat_forever,He'll have to hit his next 20 3's to end up around his average... 
heat_forever,Joey Crawford to LeBron: YOU'RE PLAYING ALL 48 BUBS
heat_forever,"Bulls will go on a 10-0 run to start the 4th, Cleveland looks WAY too casual out there and LeBron has played almost the entire game. Plus no Kyrie.

NEVERMIND - FUCKIN' DELLAVEDOVA!"
heat_forever,"possible permanent hearing loss ""just go back in the game"""
heat_forever,Jordan was too busy killing the Cavs
heat_forever,Morontic from now on
heat_forever,I'm beginning to see signs of him mentally checking out and whenever he says 'I have to play better' that means he's pissed off at his teammates.
heat_forever,"Probably just going to re-aggravate it. At the same time, having LeBron be completely wasted when the Finals rolls out won't help either. Always the same conundrum for LeBron, either he disappears in the Finals or everyone else disappears."
heat_forever,And surely he did not
heat_forever,LeBron has the one-handed cockback power dunk. Harden does it too now. I feel it wasn't really used much since Shawn Kemp days until LeBron brought it back.
heat_forever,"Recorded at 48"" at his peak athleticism in the 80's, probably around 40"" during his championship years."
heat_forever,Salary cap goes up $30M in 2017 - having your 3 best players under old TV deal max is going to be a big benefit compared other teams signing marquee players in 2017 for super-max.
heat_forever,Chris Paul has been waived by the Los Angeles Clippers
heat_forever,HAHAHA EAT A D!CK POPOVICH
heat_forever,He's always good for those guaranteed buckets but the team has to make those wide open 3s to succeed.
heat_forever,"If you're Teague, you gotta know you can't win this battle. Dellavedova is an undrafted guy making $500k a year, Teague is an ""all-star"". LULZ"
heat_forever,From 3?
heat_forever,"No one is saying that isn't impressive, but to say Jordan averaged 40 games a season is also wrong."
heat_forever,"Sorry, but take a look at that picture of Klay again. That much blood doesn't exist in your ear. It can only come from inside the head. It was a river of blood coming out of his ear."
heat_forever,"Out of all the LeBron's I've seen, he's about average."
heat_forever,This seems like such an obvious thing to do for superstar players - but analytics dweebs say a player has to play 15 minutes a game... and Thibs is on the other end of the spectrum where he tries to get a scrimmage going between the 1st and 2nd quarter.
heat_forever,So fucking easy for LeBron to score at will - just need to get him motivated to do it.
heat_forever,"JJ Redick just going ""fuck it, I'm going full circus"""
heat_forever,And swIsh
heat_forever,Delly's new nickname should be Mad Mat.
heat_forever,It's like Pau has been erased from the face of the earth.
heat_forever,"He's not smart, he thinks he's a hero and his daddy will protect him and the players can't say shit about it. It's a sad situation."
heat_forever,What a socialist commie fascist nazi!
heat_forever,It was a horrible play anyway. He thought he was such a genius that nobody could figure out what he was going to do.
heat_forever,"The main thing the Cavs have going for them is they have the hunger, which the Heat lacked last year. The Warriors might be hungry too, but they don't have anyone on that team who has recently lost in the Finals and could go super saiyan (like Dirk in 2011 or the Spurs in 2014).

So I think LeBron gets the advantage against every team remaining just because he's been to the mountaintop - almost everyone else (Dwight being an exception) still has to experience the Finals."
heat_forever,"He has half a hammy, give him a break."
heat_forever,plot twist: barf_cat is Bill Russell
heat_forever,"Then these same people so concerned about the integrity of the game turn around and whine about things like the schedule, about having to play players every day, about the seeding, about conferences, about divisions, about playing fewer games...

TOO FUCKING BAD, play the game as it was designed. If you get fucked to the 6th seed because you rested players in November or fail to beat 8th-seeded teams in the last game of your season... you should have just win more games instead of whining about your seeding."
heat_forever,Time to win the Game of War and bang Kate Upton.
heat_forever,"He's already said many times in the past that he's gone if Duncan gone. Even this year he said ""I'd imagine if those guys [Ginobli and Duncan] aren't here, you wouldn't see me either"""
heat_forever,"""For our final lesson, you'll have to lose Game 7 of our series...""
"
heat_forever,"Harden is like ""surprised? I practiced half the season without Howard"""
heat_forever,Paul on one leg still the best
heat_forever,"You were laughing at LeBron last year when it happened, admit it."
heat_forever,wants to get under 30% shooting for the series
heat_forever,Ernie's lost all control
heat_forever,"If Delladedova somehow threw a knee into the side of some guy's head, Kenny Smith would have gone apeshit and assaulted Mad Mat right at center court."
heat_forever,Not 40 foot oops to a guy who isn't quite Dwight Howard.
heat_forever,"That seems like a reckless thing for a college coach to do - putting those kids at danger of killing themselves to earn a spot on the team... It's not even right if it's min-wage players in the NFL. These kids are playing for free. 

That asshole should be fired."
heat_forever,I loved Chris Paul's Hero Ball in Game 7. He deserves a Purple Heart for that shit.
heat_forever,Refs have marching orders to keep this game tight.
heat_forever,LeBron could have scratched that time out
heat_forever,"There won't be a Finals to go to if LeBron has to carry the team by himself. JR Swish saved them for one game, but that won't last the series. The only reason LeBron left Miami was because he was pissed about carrying the whole team."
heat_forever,I have no idea how Chris Paul survived this game.
heat_forever,"You're right it's not the same, Jordan fought through the exhaustion... he didn't just give up."
heat_forever,"He's contorting his face into that forced ""don't wanna show my teeth"" kind of smile which he ended up stretching too far. "
heat_forever,"He's spoiled because he only had a couple of losing seasons early on. As soon as he starts losing consistently again, he'll get pissed off and ragequit. Guaranteed."
heat_forever,"I feel like he's still in pre-season ""trying out new things"" mode. There is absolutely no way a 25 year old guy should be gassed from trying to dunk every time. I can't imagine the fouls he'd draw... but he refuses because he's got in his head that he's going to be injured from all the hacking he took in years past."
heat_forever,"""Maneek, Maneek"""
heat_forever,"""I'm going to let them score 60 each but we'll shut down the rest of them"""
heat_forever,He just does what his coach wants and follows the culture the dirty players set. It's a dirty team top to bottom unfortunately.
heat_forever,LeBron didn't sign up for a banking plan this weekend.
heat_forever,That's true but we kind of saw what happened with Gasol. Though it was probably more mismanagement of coaching since Gasol comes out with a good year on the Bulls. The real problem was Phil Jackson leaving and maybe CP3 interests Jackson enough to stay a bit longer?
heat_forever,"Lakers would be mediocre with Kobe making $2M or $24M - there were no free agents out there to sign anyway.

And you do realize that the salary cap hit goes away when Kobe retires right? You act like he's going to be $24M on the cap forever. The funny part is, the Lakers will be paying Kobe tens of millions of dollars forever, he will still continue to be their top merchandise seller and getting his cut. 

So, in the end, Kobe always wins."
heat_forever,Another concussion protocol
heat_forever,"If they want to take chances with Steph Curry's long-term health, that's up to the Golden State Warriors. Sitting out of 1 half seems like it would be the most prudent course of action considering the game was lost already.

The NFL found that concussion tests done by team personnel were useless due to team and player pressure to return to the game and changed the policy to require a neutral party to conduct the tests. Perhaps the NBA should seriously consider this policy change."
heat_forever,"Nope, they were supposed to sign the same contract, but the Heat were around $400k per year short to keep Udonis so Wade volunteered to give up that much from his salary.

2014:

LeBron: $19,067,500

Bosh: $19,067,500

Wade: $18,673,000

Wade's always done solids for the team and to help the team when they needed him."
heat_forever,"It would have to be some freak of nature who had Jordan's prime athleticism and Jordan's prime mental game, lol - yeah I don't think it will ever happen, but never know what kid is out there. 

The next great player has to be basically engineered in a lab from genetically perfect parents and 100% focused on basketball from the very best trainers."
heat_forever,They are under orders to only call iffy fouls if the shot misses to speed up the game.
heat_forever,"Agreed, he's always running underneath guys in the air, just feels like this Bulls team is just full of dirty fucks. Once Thibodeau is gone, hopefully next coach tosses out the garbage and returns the Bulls to the great team they used to be in the 90s."
heat_forever,"Well now they aren't, before Game 1, they were"
heat_forever,That's Captain Jean-Luc Richard Mbah a Moute Picard to you filthy peasants.
heat_forever,I'd much rather LeBron just squished Noah's head until it exploded.
heat_forever,This was the scratched play
heat_forever,that was a direct quote from his coach's interview between the quarters
heat_forever,"Total disaster for the Cavs, they blew it"
heat_forever,"JVG - the coach who invented the ""flying out of bounds timeout"" which later got banned... lol"
heat_forever,"Well, time for 15 straight LeBron iso's to let the Hawks back in it"
heat_forever,I think they are going to pretend it wasn't a concussion and return him to the game.
heat_forever,BALL DON'T LIE
heat_forever,Or not rested their players in an early November game after a 3 day break.
heat_forever,"LeBron's made his feelings known many times. He's flat out said he doesn't like it in Cleveland. There's a reason he always says ""northeast Ohio"" instead of Cleveland."
heat_forever,"Manu can only flop for fouls now, he has zero basketball skills."
heat_forever,"Exactly this, he's only good at somehow making it seem like he didn't  mean to undercut someone or put his fist in someone's mouth."
heat_forever,The Knicks did force Cleveland to take J.R. - they only wanted Iman
heat_forever,That would be a disaster.
heat_forever,"I wouldn't call him TT level rebounding - those offensive rebounds are basically saving a possession, and he does it at a rate 4x higher than Love. An elite rate, approaching Dennis Rodman levels of offensive rebounding. And when you give players like Jordan or LeBron a 2nd or 3rd chance after a miss, it's absolute murder."
heat_forever,"What is so difficult? Part of sports is accepting that sometimes you come up short. Only the Spurs fanbase does shit like this. If Tim Duncan doesn't care about missing the quadruple double, then his fans should just stop wasting everyone's time 12 years later. Get over it - he was 2 blocks short."
heat_forever,"If he ain't going up for dunks, he ain't getting high fives from the captain."
heat_forever,Kevin who?
heat_forever,All hail the Champion LA Clippers.
heat_forever,They are being taken advantage of and put in a position to get seriously injured by playing recklessly. Don't be foolish.
heat_forever,"If he jumped straight up, it wouldn't matter - might lose his wrists though"
heat_forever,"""ERNIE, IT'S BEEN LIKE 10 MINUTES ALREADY!"""
heat_forever,"Um, most college players are used to zone and back then everyone went to college 3-4 years so... I think they knew more about the game than most of today's players with AAU dunk-and-showboat experience."
heat_forever,Blatt just gets done telling them to stop taking shitty 3s and they take a shitty 3.
heat_forever,"Tristan is a disaster at the line, maybe he should switch hands again"
heat_forever,"The NY/NJ metro area has over 23 million people and millions of NBA fans, they could sustain 10 NBA teams if they wanted to."
heat_forever,"Cavs down 3-2 in the series and down 3 with 5 seconds remaining in Game 6. 

Wait a minute, is that Ray Allen's music?"
heat_forever,Popovich unveils his Hack-a-Paul strategy
heat_forever,Paul will somehow miss 2 free throws and Tim Duncan will hit a 3 to win it
heat_forever,She will totally suck your dick if you make $10 million a year
heat_forever,Vacation it is
heat_forever,Mad Mat so strong he can send Millsap (240 pound power forward) flying backwards from his great jesus strength.
heat_forever,"Doesn't matter, 4 blown plays in a row by 1 guy right when they could have cut it to 5 and instead it blows up to 12"
heat_forever,Parker should be pissed he was used as a hack-a foul bitch - a hall of fame player should take that personally.
heat_forever,Even got the Reddit insurance.
heat_forever,"Good idea, give LeBron some standing rest by hacking a 66% free throw shooter. COTY type of genius here"
heat_forever,"Hahaha, Shump won't even give them a pity 3"
heat_forever,"ITT: Spurs fans coordinating their shitting on the Clippers, it's like their Super Bowl today"
heat_forever,Told you guys... series over.
heat_forever,**where your opponent has no time outs**
heat_forever,Exactly 2 more games
heat_forever,"Eject that fucker, send him back to Atlanta, he won't play in Game 4 either."
heat_forever,"I'll never understand if you're gonna do hack-a - use your shit 12th man to do it, not your hall of fame players, lol. Baynes is expendable. Not Duncan &amp; Parker"
heat_forever,Everyone forgets he also hit the crucial 3 pointer that put them within 2 in the first place (followed by the Spurs choking a free throw which then led to LeBron bricking the perfect 3-pointer right into Bosh's hands to feed Allen for the moonwalk 3 to tie it).
heat_forever,"If he had prime CP3 feeding him in 2011, that might have locked up that ring for him (and possibly led to 1 or 2 more)."
heat_forever,"Hahaha, those kids aren't making the NBA. The real prospects are in the AAU honing their dunking and shamgod passes."
heat_forever,20 points down at home... THIS IS FINE
heat_forever,I like the EGA quality graphics and you missed pasting the Cavs logo on his shirt!
heat_forever,You'll sing a different tune if he takes a hard screen and gets knocked out.
heat_forever,"Not when he's injured with a bad knee and a bad ankle, he's clanked multiple technical free throws in the playoffs already."
heat_forever,Offensive player throwing the ball off a defensive player's foot is not a kickball violation.
heat_forever,"Rose is off balance on every shot he takes, he has horrible shooting form."
heat_forever,So much threedership from Fisher
heat_forever,He's been following LeBron since LeBron was like 14 - he's like his uncle now.
heat_forever,"It's just a game, he's a kid. He can play for hours on end, but he's too busy filming commercials. He's gotten soft. He needs to get back to the basics. It doesn't matter if Jordan was great or not, he was still 35 - if he can do it, a guy 10 years younger should be able to do it."
heat_forever,"He's not going to say anything because the media isn't going to report this story, he only reacts when it hurts the company's bottom line."
heat_forever,[Nightmare Fuel](http://i.imgur.com/wn2KGMr.png)
heat_forever,Pau looks like the Spanish G-Man
heat_forever,"Agreed, should be a 1 game suspension. No reason to ever kick a player. It's no different than JR Smith throwing a backhand at someone pushing him in the back. Yes it's annoying to be pushed in the back, but no reason to backhand him. Same as it's annoying to be leg locked, but no reason to kick him."
heat_forever,I'm thinking the Clippers are the best team out of the 8 remaining - by far
heat_forever,"Agreed, he's counting years he wasn't even in the league as 0 games played. They should be removed from the chart."
heat_forever,"It was either Ken Mauer or Scott Foster, and refused to leave the court after 2 straight technicals. He was being held back and kept lunging at the ref... It was more of the variety of ""I'll fucking kill you"" in the Miami Heat of the moment. It was a closeout game so nothing ever came of it."
heat_forever,"Yes, the blood came from the head not the ear, I think we're in agreement."
heat_forever,"Perk giveth, then he giveth away"
heat_forever,I think Iguodala over-reaction like his arm fell out of his socket... then he's perfectly fine the second the announcement is made.
heat_forever,Harden to LA for Lin/Clarkson/Sacre CONFIRMED.
heat_forever,I like how nobody even said that Griffin got a triple double. That's just how awesome Chris Paul was.
heat_forever,I think a lot of the stuff the Hawks are doing works great in the regular season but they nowhere near the same execution level as the Spurs who've had 10+ years with their core to perfect it. So it falls apart in the playoffs against real competition.
heat_forever,"Ok, Curry is as at least as good as a hobbled broken foot Durant. We'll see how it goes next season."
heat_forever,"If Dellavedova did that play, it would have been a bench clearing brawl"
heat_forever,Kyrie is going to be forced back into this game because the Cavs always find a way to fuck things up
heat_forever,"Why would he work on 3 point shots when he could drive at will when he was younger or shoot anywhere on the floor when he was older?

If he played in today's NBA, you really don't think he had the form or commitment to excel at 3 point shooting if he really wanted to? He just chose to excel at what was valued at the time. 3 point shooting was basically limited to role players like Steve Kerr and a few outliers like Reggie Miller who had no other abilities."
heat_forever,Clippers just want this game to end
heat_forever,"So you're saying Cavs over Bulls then? Let it be known then, you're such a great fan."
heat_forever,"Any one without rose-colored ""Pop can do no wrong"" glasses would agree. Only butthurt Spurs fans and people who don't know basketball would disagree."
heat_forever,"The refs should have no-called it and let Manu blow a possession. But in the end, the Spurs got fucked for it by losing a point in the whole exchange instead of taking the last shot and either being +0 or +2/3. Instead they ended up -1 because they got ""cute"". Spurs have been fucking themselves all series long. They deserved to lose."
heat_forever,Why would a coach bench his best player in 4th quarter of a game 7 - no reason at all I suppose. The same coach who publicly questioned Wilt's commitment to the team. He lost his job for sticking to this guns and benching Wilt... for no reason at all according to Wilt apologists.
heat_forever,"They won't need to wait much longer, maybe like an hour or so"
heat_forever,"Yeah but nobody took Sterling seriously before or after the incident, he was just some old buffoon who wasn't politically correct, but honestly I doubt he's done anything worse than other NBA owners (see the Atlanta Hawks co-owner). You don't become a billionaire by being nice to everyone."
heat_forever,70 lost in four
heat_forever,"In classic LeBron fashion, he completes the series just 1 short of a triple double:

Series Averages: 26/11/9/2/2"
heat_forever,"You'd surprised how far even 50 USD goes in Africa, a month's worth of food. You might spend it on a week's worth of lattes or a video game or a basketball game ticket."
heat_forever,"Clipper bowls over a Spur - charge

Spur bowls over a Clipper - blocking"
heat_forever,"hahaha, Pau getting out-AGGUHGHHGHHGHHED twice in a row"
heat_forever,"Thank Delly for putting back spin on the ball so LeBron couldn't walk it up, lol"
heat_forever,"""And that's why LeBron must go free, your honor"""
heat_forever,Yeah people forget an assist includes someone else making a basket - it's not automatic.
heat_forever,"Every foul on LeBron has been weak as fuck, holy shit"
heat_forever,He's averaging a triple double over last 2 games. *lelbron smirk*
heat_forever,"Ok, you're getting upset about this - whatever. Nobody can say anything negative about Wilt while you're around. Wilt never did anything wrong and it's everyone else's problem. I think that's the only story you're willing to accept."
heat_forever,"Spurs should be up by 20, being tied at half means they lose."
heat_forever,Noah is such a dope
heat_forever,"Wow, the Hawks can't catch a break."
heat_forever,"Bulls had Gasol/Rose/Butler - while LeBron is better than those 3, any of those are better than Kyrie or Love. Even then Love was gone and Kyrie was hobbled the whole series... this was the Bulls' chance, if ever."
heat_forever,"See, they aren't hitting those 3's now are they"
heat_forever,"Millsap: ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, MORON"" to ref

LeBron: ""Hey ref, I had two hands on the ball""

I think even Hawks fans can tell the difference here."
heat_forever,"Welp, guess it's gonna be Golden State vs Cleveland in the Finals"
heat_forever,I think Chris Paul would hate a guy who can't make a layup even more. DeAndre shot almost 70%.
heat_forever,"Don't rest players in November, problem solved."
heat_forever,So many cheap touch fouls
heat_forever,The player formerly known as Prince Luc Mbah a Moute?
heat_forever,End of Q1: Clippers 48 Spurs 13
heat_forever,Even Zimbabwe won't take that currency
heat_forever,"It's a bit early for Finals Mike Miller, they are just testing him."
heat_forever,"Every team played under the same rules. If San Antonio wanted a guaranteed top 4 spot, they should have just won their division. You know, like how DeAndre should just make his free throws.

Spurs fucked themselves because they chose to rest guys in November... it's their choice. They have to live with it."
heat_forever,So you were absolutely wrong then right? Good.
heat_forever,"If Kawhi waits until the very end, the Spurs can easily screw him with a lowball offer ($12M a year instead of max). They are already upset that he thinks he's worth a max, this could be their way of sticking it to him and he will have no choice but to sign. ""Thanks for your loyalty"".

His agent will advise him to sign the first max offer sheet he gets, then it's REALLY guaranteed. Never pin your hopes on a whim... when millions of dollars are involved, billionaires can be very petty."
heat_forever,"I know but to a basketball fan not versed in hockey, they might think it's the same in both sports."
heat_forever,This game delivered in every possible way... let it end.
heat_forever,"There's no one on Toronto as good as Bosh - and no, you can't have him back, lol"
heat_forever,Dwight was talking about having unprotected sex though.
heat_forever,"lol, JVG calls it at 9 minutes left in the 4th - didn't he watch Game 6?"
heat_forever,that dude who isn't harden with the harden beard just shut up the entire crowd.
heat_forever,"The only players carried from first Bulls 3 peat were Jordan (who was actually quite a different player post-baseball) and Pippen (the only consistent player). Every other player was replaced, though a lot of the archetypes and roles remained. Grant -&gt; Rodman, Paxson -&gt; Kerr. Maybe the only new wrinkle was Kukoc who was maximized to the fullest with his Euro-style which was fairly new at the time."
heat_forever,"On Dunleavey, I agree"
heat_forever,who knew Dellavedova would be the god damn closer
heat_forever,Pretty much
heat_forever,"How do those line drive free throws keep going in, Jordan wonders"
heat_forever,Long 12 minutes now... Cavs hate the clock
heat_forever,Clippers looking legit beating up on Houston without Chris Paul... scary legit!
heat_forever,They complained about having to face the Clippers and wanted the seeding to be reformed.
heat_forever,"They should really just have high-speed cameras and markers on a wall with some markers on the shoes and have players try a standing jump and a running jump. A computer could easily figure it out. 

I guess the reach contraption is just faster when you have to get through a lot of players, but yeah it gives an advantage to guys with longer wingspans."
heat_forever,2nd round has been living up to the hype
heat_forever,Refs are going to launch a full out fuck the Clippers assault - they better prepare their anuses.
heat_forever,He's lucky Big Baby didn't take a Big Bite of that chicken leg
heat_forever,"Bulls Great Quarter + Cavs Average Quarter = small Cavs lead

Bulls Average Quarter + Cavs Great Quarter = blowout"
heat_forever,That's Game 6 vs Utah championship sealing swag on that followthrough.
heat_forever,They are done after tonight.
heat_forever,Is Harden's new nickname The Chef? 
heat_forever,"Well, he made about $888k a minute for his fight :)"
heat_forever,"LeBron ran a ""complain"" play which drew everyone's attention away from Perk scoring"
heat_forever,"Ok, then how about get rid of the 3 second violation. It only harms a few people in the league (rim protectors) and if someone can't drive on them, then well... they should just learn how to shoot the ball."
heat_forever,Sorry but anyone who thinks a Spurs team from the weakest era of basketball (2003 to 2007) could hold a candle to any team in the 90's is a bit too biased to continue discussions with.
heat_forever,Nah dumbest thing he did was leaving Duncan out at the end of 2013 game 6
heat_forever,"He knows he's about to carry a team to the Finals just to get blown out again, I'm sure he's looking forward to it."
heat_forever,LeBron always comes out half-asleep for Game 1's
heat_forever,"I'd put something moderate on the line, like maybe the winner gets the 15th pick in the draft."
heat_forever,"All he had to do was stand under the basket, why would he be chasing a point guard's feet?"
heat_forever,"""NBA Champion Dion Waiters just scratched your play, rook."""
heat_forever,"Cavs have a tendency to relax in the last few minutes, they need to up the pressure."
heat_forever,Not 5-Finals-in-a-row-and-sort-of-pissed-he-only-won-2 LeBron
heat_forever,Bye.
heat_forever,"Except in game 2, where he kept feeding wide-open 3 point shooters."
heat_forever,"I'm pretty sure this is impossible if either of the teams are over the cap. I don't remember the exact details, but they made S&amp;T's much more difficult to pull off."
heat_forever,"LeBron uses his whole body when he shoots, maybe not good form, but I think a combination of a back issue and ankle issues are messing up with his jump shot form."
heat_forever,"The guy who got destroyed by the Heat in 2013 because of his shitty play calling in Game 6 and Game 7. Yes ""that guy""..."
heat_forever,"""Thass juss turrble"""
heat_forever,"Can we bury this comparison once and for all, they are nowhere near the Spurs and never will be."
heat_forever,Teams should never be forced to shoot a free throw if they don't want to. They should choose whether they want to inbound or take the free throws.
heat_forever,"Curry shoots 1-on-5 

Jackson: That's good offense

No that's why you got fired, Jackson"
heat_forever,"JR Smith has hit some absolutely monstrous shots this series that kept the Cavs in most of the games - save a Rose miracle, the Bulls are lucky to have won 2 games this series."
heat_forever,"The NBA lets so much of this shit by, and then they are surprised when people retaliate."
heat_forever,"Nothing too graphic, but you can see his leg was completely locked when it planted hard."
heat_forever,"Still, there's no guys at 275 pounds of muscle on the Spurs. Popovich probably never turned on the A/C at their practice facility to save a few bucks."
heat_forever,Kyrie had all the mirrors destroyed so he didn't have to look in them
heat_forever,Yeah right after Gibson two-arm shoved him in the back blindside. Or did you conveniently miss that?
heat_forever,What's this? The Spurs not getting all the calls? These refs need to check their text messages.
heat_forever,MJ and Pippen were paid a total of $6M per year for their first 4 rings though. So they were able to get a lot of good players around them.
heat_forever,Splitter that jangly flop fucker
heat_forever,"Well Kyrie would be a new star finally getting his ring. So everyone wins, right?"
heat_forever,"Man, that's the all-criminal referee murder squad."
heat_forever,"Well Rose probably thought he was wide open until he saw a 6'8"" 260 lbs guy 3 feet above him."
heat_forever,He meant just like Houston went out to show they weren't going to get swept.
heat_forever,"Told you guys, you can't fucking elbow people in their neck or ribs and expect to get away with it."
heat_forever,"If you consider % of available rebounds, Rodman still blows all those old guys away, he collected the highest % of rebounds available to him than any other player ever. No one else has come close to him since then. Rodman had a number of 30+ rebound games during the slowest pace era of the NBA."
heat_forever,It's such a bush-league move. It should be called a flagrant every time because we've seen what can happen to a guy when he gets his arms locked.
heat_forever,A Dellatrebuchedovay
heat_forever,"LeBron's like - imma score now, out of the way"
heat_forever,"The only reason this is on ABC during east coast prime time is to push the Warriors as the new ""it"" team, failing miserably."
heat_forever,Blatt was 1 second away from bitch slapping Rachel
heat_forever,He's recalibrating his body for the finals
heat_forever,Clippers shitting all the opportunities away. Blake had a wide open lane for a dunk and passed it up for a Crawford brick.
heat_forever,"Atlanta is going to take someone on the Cavs out, I feel it"
heat_forever,Every non-Heat fan in the Heat/Spurs Finals thread last year cheered when LeBron cramped up and some specific Spurs fans were hoping he had a stroke and cheering that he was gone for the series.
heat_forever,As he frolicks with bimbos in a pool filled with 2 billion dollars
heat_forever,"He's 0-6 at it, certainly it must be difficult if the great Michael Jordan couldn't do it"
heat_forever,Spurs are hitting every 3 they take and are barely ahead... won't bode well when they go cold
heat_forever,"LeBron decided to take the rest of the game off, lol"
heat_forever,http://i.imgur.com/Dc4jvSO.jpg
heat_forever,Is that true? T-Mac signed with the Spurs for their playoff run in 2013 without playing in the regular season.
heat_forever,It's so weird to hear all this crowd noise but the crowd isn't doing anything.
heat_forever,"DUNCAN, PARKER, GINOBLI, KAWHI &lt;- only Spurs fans call these guys junk"
heat_forever,"Every expert has Bulls as best team in the East, #1 seed, clearly better than the Cavs... so much for the experts"
heat_forever,Time to unveil Hack-a-LeBron to save a point on assists to JR Swish 3's
heat_forever,Because that earns brownie points with Thibodeau and his thug teammates.
heat_forever,"Why is Kyrie shooting technical free throws, he's injured and obviously not himself - so he's not a 90% shooter right now. Figure it out Blatt"
heat_forever,"I love that the same guys defending and applauding AirConditioningGate are now whining about ""ClockGate""."
heat_forever,"There was 4 other players there just watching him put the ball back in... any one of them could have raked his arms. It's obvious Wall didn't want to challenge for fear of his broken hand, such a shame."
heat_forever,Dellevadova the Clos-ah
heat_forever,Bulls have lost the mental game already.
heat_forever,Instant wrap-ups as soon as he rebounds?
heat_forever,"lol, that announcer has some dark secrets involving expensive suits and dead hookers"
heat_forever,Yeah this series is over
heat_forever,"Yes, it was revealed in an award-winning docudrama that won 17 oscars.

Here's the relevant clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbaKze622Kg"
heat_forever,We were 1 quarter away from being at least 32 quarters away.
heat_forever,"Karl Malone, a 6'9"" 250 pound PF averaged 41 mpg in the playoffs... for 19 YEARS. 

He averaged 40 minutes per game over 20 playoff games AT AGE 40. 

Did he complain about being exhausted? Nope.

So no, Blake Griffin does not impress me when he gets tired at age 26."
heat_forever,Joey generally hates home teams though. Maybe he'll just fuck everybody.
heat_forever,"And from hockey assists as well - Gretzky abused a loophole that I think is not allowed anymore, he would sit behind the net and just feed players charging the net from angles. So he was guaranteed to get the assist, even if the guy charging the net passed it off to someone else for the goal."
heat_forever,"Have to say, Scottie still looks amazing. I bet he could get out there and drop 20-6-6-2-2 no problem."
heat_forever,"Maybe they just reused this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1KsV-22sro

(this actually aired on TV shortly before the Ray Allen shot)."
heat_forever,"I question a crowd who gets silenced on a free throw, lol"
heat_forever,Foul trouble gonna fuck the Cavs here
heat_forever,"There was a minute long delay as they refs tried to sort out the clock issue - if Popovich spent more time getting his team together to draw up a new play instead of standing in front of the clock keeper and calling him a dumb fuck over and over (really reveals what kind of person he is when he is unfiltered), maybe his team would have had a shot to win."
heat_forever,"Typical Spurs fan, pay no attention"
heat_forever,No one's going to ignore this triple double.
heat_forever,"Since Green is allowed to foul at will, Houston can't win."
heat_forever,"Cavs are gonna shit this one away, I can feel it, lol"
heat_forever,Fuck man the injuries in these playoffs have been brutal
heat_forever,"Spurs tried it twice this year and got fucked both times. Once in preseason against Alba Berlin and once during the regular season.

They gave up the 2 points to be up 1, got fouled, then went 1/2 on free throws and had a game tying shot (or game winning in the case of Alba Berlin) put on their ass then lost in overtime.

It's far better to force a shot that has a 60% chance of missing by a great 3 point shooter to be 80% or 90% chance of missing with even light pressure."
heat_forever,"There's no way the Cavs can sign Aldridge to a max, regardless of what Aldridge says, he clearly doesn't understand cap rules. The Cavs are over the cap even if Love leaves, Kyrie's salary triples when the free agency starts, plus LeBron's cap hold will be 150% of around $22M..."
heat_forever,Do your research so you don't sound silly anymore.
heat_forever,"And 60/5/5 games - Jordan: 1, LeBron: 0"
heat_forever,The point is - assurances mean nothing
heat_forever,Delly is owning the Bulls
heat_forever,"Box score says 8, so it's 8"
heat_forever,"Seems like a definite order from Thibs to not complain about fouls tonight (remember Noah didn't complain, then later on another player accepted the call and now Snell)... but then the Bulls go out and commit a flagrant."
heat_forever,"If he wasn't playing next to LeBron and Kyrie, he'd be sitting at home during the playoffs. I think that's been pretty well established."
heat_forever,Then he remembers 2007 and 2011 and 2014
heat_forever,"They'll say he hit his head on a locker, since it happened outside of game time, NBA's concussion protocol won't apply. Disaster averted (for Warriors title hopes). 20 years later, Klay is wandering around a park naked wondering why the trees are talking to him in Esperanto."
heat_forever,Chris Paul is right...
heat_forever,"This week on Shark Tank:

Inventor: ""I invented a bot that trolls reddit for you""

Cuban: ""I'll pay you $10 million"""
heat_forever,Scratched all the coach's plays
heat_forever,"They probably put her on the world's highest rotisserie.
"
heat_forever,Greatest game of his career... what a fucking warrior. Manu will get the call on a half court shot though.
heat_forever,"Oh gee, another dirty fuck Bulls player... WHAT A SURPRISE"
heat_forever,Yes when those medical professionals are biased.
heat_forever,Dovakhin owning Teague
heat_forever,Jamal Crawford practices his ball english off the roof supports.
heat_forever,That means Dwight Howard has 11 champion rings and should be immediately launched to the top of any GOAT discussions.
heat_forever,"""I can't be bothered to play in the regular season when Michael Bay is tapping me to carry TMNT2 to box office glory"""
heat_forever,"JVG's favorite thing to say when a coach does something smart: ""That's exactly what I would have done"""
heat_forever,"I think the Cavs lost the most out of any team in the playoffs, lol"
heat_forever,"Noah is such a dumbass, lol"
heat_forever,What's this? The Spurs not getting all the calls? The refs need to check their facebook.
heat_forever,DOWN GOES THE SPURS! KNOCKOUT!
heat_forever,"Listen, the Spurs sucked this year, get over it. If they were good, they would have gotten a better seed. They chose to forfeit games by sitting their starters in November and not taking teams like New Orleans seriously. And so they wound up with the 6th seed as they deserved. Then they lost in the first round. So they had a bad year."
heat_forever,Kicking people during an organized basketball competition = thug
heat_forever,Then he walks up to the line and bumps Shumpert - just toss this dumb fuck out of the game before it gets out of hand.
heat_forever,Houston putting their whole season on Josh Smith leanback 3's
heat_forever,"Well, without Korver, Horford and a hobbled Carroll, it's pretty much a 4 game sweep and Kyrie gets his rest. Heck they can probably rest LeBron too at this point, the Hawks are completely and utterly mentally defeated."
heat_forever,"LeBron is fucked, always gotta have an injured sidekick in the playoffs."

heat_forever,"LeBron gets undercut and pushed out of mid-air on half of his dunks. Even in this series Antic tried to take out LeBron with a two-arm shove while he was in mid-air. And Atlanta fans howled that it was a ""good solid play"" and shouldn't be a flagrant..."
heat_forever,"Well maybe this could have happened:

heat_forever,The problem was the Warriors didn't do the concussion protocol and then when he admitted on live TV to still being dizzy - now they spin a bullshit story to avoid being reprimanded.
heat_forever,"And GOAT is such a logical argument in and of itself. The facts are that the only reason Jordan got to where he is was because he always came through when the stakes were the highest and the most people were watching. We can whine and cry about that time in 95 when he lost to Orlando, but honestly, nobody remembers that except us fanatics. Everyone remembers LeBron looking shiftless and lost in 2007 and then again in 2011. Even the most casual fans know that LeBron lost 3 Finals and that's hard to get over in the zeitgeist when people compare LeBron to Jordan."
heat_forever,"He was lightheaded after a short run and went out threw up an airball and got rejected twice as well as being lost on offense for most of the 3rd quarter... he did manage to recover, but to say he was fine is false.

Myers pressured them into giving the result he wanted by going to the media and saying ""there should be no problem"" and so the doctors felt obliged to give that ""diagnosis"" since they are on the payroll.

Hopefully it doesn't lead to long-term effects for Curry."
heat_forever,"""Try doing a hand stand on it. What? You can't? Ok, we'll pencil you in for 40 minutes tonight."""
heat_forever,I checked the other universe where the goaltend was called and he missed the free throw - so no harm done.
heat_forever,You can tell they always plan the half-time video for Kenny/Isiah after the first few minutes of the game...
heat_forever,"He's tired, but he's demanding the ball, and he know the Bulls have a flagrant 2 waiting for him, so he's just taking bad shots."
heat_forever,"Um, Phil Jackson's teams have always featured strong 3-point shooting and he invented the role of the 3-point specialist. He just doesn't see the point of a 1-dimensional 3-point only offense."
heat_forever,"Kobe got there 7 times, so he's better than Jordan then right?"
heat_forever,"nah, neither of these teams are beating Cleveland."
heat_forever,Now that's threedership.

heat_forever,Warriors racking up those injuries all of a sudden
heat_forever,Refs are gonna do what they can to salvage the 4th quarter ratings
heat_forever,"Like the Spurs never caused a malfunction to gain an advantage before, they just happened to get fucked by it this time.

The hilarious part is the Spurs fucked themselves into the 6th seed by resting players in November. They thought they'd roll in to the postseason at 1st or 2nd but instead they fucked themselves and ended up playing on road in game 7 and got fucked by home cooking. It is what it is!

That's why you gotta play your players every single game and try to win every single game so you get that high seed and home court!"
heat_forever,Warriors are getting some very lucky bounces
heat_forever,"No, because the Finals is where great players are supposed to play great and Jordan always played great in the Finals. Like it or not, that's how he gets elevated among not just fanatics like us, but among the entire population. You might not believe it, but a large number of casual fans only watch the Finals and nothing else."
heat_forever,"""socially conservative (unless you're doing something we don't approve of)"""
heat_forever,They played better with him out anyway.
heat_forever,"Actually it was the other way around. Jerry Krause refused to re-hire Jackson (""organizations win championships not coaches and players"") and Jordan said he'd retire if they didn't keep Jackson. So Jordan kept his word and retired when Jackson wasn't signed."
heat_forever,Thompson should have defied the laws of gravity to avoid fouling the guy undercutting him.

Or Boston fans at the end of Game 3 and Game 4 this year."
heat_forever,"Ballmer is probably like ""keep it under like $200 million a year or something, I dunno"""
heat_forever,The nice thing is they can bench him unlike in NY but they better hope Kyrie actually shows up if that happens.
heat_forever,"Kawhi is going to sign a deal on day 1 of free agency and the Spurs will have 3 days to match it. No sane person will wait to sign when they have a $15 million per year contract sitting in front of their face.

Also moving players then making offers is dangerous - Gasol and Aldridge can both decide to re-sign or go elsewhere and then the Spurs just lost Splitter and Diaw on top of Ginobli and Duncan... that would be disastrous."

heat_forever,"The Bulls only chance for Game 6 is to take out LeBron here with a savagely hard flagrant 2, Cavs should be worried."
heat_forever,Considering he'll have no titles with #23... I'm going to say Jordan

heat_forever,There are a lot of kids here who will fight you tooth and nail on this point and they won't even know why.
heat_forever,"Kenny is being racist, he doesn't like that a white guy is hustling and going for loose balls. He's basically saying ""you're a white scrub, you should stay out of the play""."
heat_forever,"Well he's an idiot then, it's plenty of time to catch, dribble and shoot. He just didn't trust his players enough to be able to execute a simple shot, so he went for the over-the-top alley-oop play they never practiced before."
heat_forever,The amount of revenue collected would be much lower though and so there will never be a contraction.
heat_forever,"Only because ""classy"" Spurs fans and their /r/nba cohorts were spam-bombing it."

heat_forever,Nobody cares because they turn off the TV
heat_forever,Except the part where it's intentional and unnecessary to the neck - that's automatic Flagrant 2 every day 
heat_forever,I'd say no one else bothered to do it. Let's not forget Wilt sitting himself out of a 4th quarter of a Game 7 with 5 fouls because he was afraid to get a 6th foul and ruin his no-foul-out streak... any modern day star doing that would be crucified right out of the league.
heat_forever,Dunleavy is always involved in weird shit involving punching mouths and elbowing throats and everyone was cheering for him...
heat_forever,"LeBron doesn't actually have an agent, he just hired his friend to run LeBron's sports agency for a salary. LeBron is not paying one red cent to his agent, and takes the fees from other players. So LeBron is actually making money off of other NBA players who sign with his agency... it's actually a great way to get himself paid a bigger piece of the NBA pie."
heat_forever,"But by your definition being 1 of 5 in the Finals is better than being 4 of 4 in the Finals. SOUNDS ODD TO ME.

heat_forever,I don't think Kerr came up with the splash brothers...
heat_forever,He's an idiot because of 17 years of idiotic plays that have cost the Spurs time and time again. Just because he won 5 doesn't mean he hasn't made tremendously dumb mistakes. This year is just another example. Hack-a-Jordan fucked the Spurs because Popovich became obsessed with outsmarting Doc and compromised his system to do it.
heat_forever,Perkins always manages to get a tech/flagrant/3 turnovers/2 fouls within the first 30 seconds every time.
heat_forever,Atlanta pulled off the biggest con-job ever - convincing everyone their coach is great and that they deserved 4 all-stars...
heat_forever,Because of his dad
heat_forever,Cavs Poor Quarter + Bulls Poor Quarter = Kill Me Now
heat_forever,Horford is also gimpy.
heat_forever,What you're saying is true for the last 3 or 4 years of Kobe's career. It holds no weight from about 2001 to 2010 when Kobe was elite in both offense and defense.
heat_forever,Get that early free throw practice for Jordan
heat_forever,Blatt awarding captaincy on hair strength
heat_forever,"Yes, which is why there were 8 70-win teams in 1996 and Jordan was convicted for freebasing secret stuff which enhanced his abilities - truly a Barry Bondsian asterisk in basketball sports history"
heat_forever,"Woah, Perkins is even more useless than Noah"
humanhighlightreel,"You need both to win a championship/contend. No way you can get an above average defense starting those too, unless you have a DPOY-caliber C. 

They overlap on offense more than you think too. Love is at his best when he is allowed to ball stop a little and play inside out. Melo is a huge ball stopper and occupies similar parts of the floor. 
"
humanhighlightreel,Correlation does not equal causation. I don't think the Spurs won because they were younger bro. They won because they were better. 
humanhighlightreel,"When you go small your spacing is much better for sure. It also reduces one of the key strengths of your team this postseason - offensive rebounding. 

I am not sure why you are being defensive. I think the Cavs offense is great, I was just correcting the incorrect claim of elite spacing. Great spacing usually leads to efficient shooting, and you guys, despite having the best ORTG in the postseason, have shot less efficiently than the Dubs and Rockets while playing a weaker schedule. LeBron is struggling from the field precisely because of poor spacing. You are getting your points in other ways in the wake of Love's injury, which is indicative of versatility in your lineup. That is a good thing. "
humanhighlightreel,why isn't 0 an option?
humanhighlightreel,"No way man. If we are going all time you take Barkley over Rodman. He would average pretty much the same number of boards, but he would be the most dominant post player in history and a great floor stretcher at the 5. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean if he meant that its more defensible, but he said offensive player twice. Though I still think LeBron is a better scorer. He isn't as smooth as Melo, but he has always averaged 2 more ppg on 3% better true shooting. Melo is so smooth and can score all over the court, but LeBron can basically get to the rim at will which is simply more valuable. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah but those aren't the guys he is running into the ground. 
humanhighlightreel,"nope, votes were in before"
humanhighlightreel,[You get Pac Man dude!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiYYT9dtAfg)
humanhighlightreel,No. Total seasons is cumulative 
humanhighlightreel,He literally just showed shot charts and explained how they work. 
humanhighlightreel,"This was like Bill Simmons idea. Then they fired him and took it lol. 

Completely infeasible though. Why would players play hard to get a dude who might take their job. "
humanhighlightreel,he's also just not as good at basketball
humanhighlightreel,"that's certianly fair, but Ben Wallace is #1 by far. "
humanhighlightreel,Definitely. It would also be way too difficult for teams to time intentional fouls while passes are between players. 
humanhighlightreel,PTSD?
humanhighlightreel,keep gettin dem checks J-Smoove
humanhighlightreel,Yes I am very high on Jones. His defense this year went to a whole new level. I think he can be a future All Star if he went to the East. 
humanhighlightreel,"i think you meant on both *ends*, Rudy"
humanhighlightreel,True dat
humanhighlightreel,"I absolutely think they were locks going into the playoffs, barring injury. No team as dominant as them in the regular season has ever even had a 7 game series. "
humanhighlightreel,Thank god we cleared that up 
humanhighlightreel,haha touche. I will say that I only clicked on his account because I was seeing if he was the same guy I was just talking to on another thread (similar username). But that is a valid point. 
humanhighlightreel,"not even close brother.

humanhighlightreel,"No its not. The millions of dollars isn't a present they should be grateful for, its their market value. If he doesn't want to move to Minnesota, he has every right to express that. "
humanhighlightreel,"definitely. its paralysis by analysis, and his poor showing in the tournament (realistically the only college ball most people here watch) didn't help. he put up the most absurd stats this year despite facing more double teams than any NCAA player I have ever seen. His touch is unbelievable. He will absolutely murder people down low in the NBA, where double teaming is a more dangerous proposition. 

defensively he is weak, but that was honestly more positioning and effort than some perceived lack of athleticism. is he an explosive rim protector? absolutely not. but he is a giant body with long arms who glides around the court. he could absolutely be serviceable or better at the next level. 

he is simply the best basketball player in the draft by a big margin. "
humanhighlightreel,"Right, but if you are going to go by any metric it has to be value. The reason there are so many dominatant PGs right now isn't just randomness, its also the evolution of the sport. It is easiest in 2015 to impact the game (at least on offense) from the PG spot because it is a penetration league and those guys have the ball the most. (Just like the opposite was true in the 60s and 70s). 

As a result a guy like John Wall might appear to be ""better"" than Cousins because he has a greater impact, but it also makes it easier to find the ""next"" John Wall. 

There is simply no way to compare players of different positions unless you use their value to an NBA team as the framework. That is why the ""hypothetical fantasy draft"" method of comparing players works best. If I was a GM in a hypothetical, all-league draft, I would take Cousins over Wall, personally, and get a nice PG in the second. "
humanhighlightreel,And Harden has been great in both. 
humanhighlightreel,Except none of those stats are close to perfect indicators for quality. 
humanhighlightreel,long answer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zWnhfTBnRw
humanhighlightreel,The question was players moving to bigger markets tho
humanhighlightreel,a team as dominant as the Warriors has never even gone to 7 games. 
humanhighlightreel,"GOTEEEEEEEEEEEEM 

*checks flair*

fuck. "
humanhighlightreel,"nah, they were what made him overrated"
humanhighlightreel,"Out of curiosity, why did you put 3 bigs on team B? They are obviously fucked with three guys that slow playing together. The would lose by all these teams by 20"
humanhighlightreel,"I don't think there is any difference. It is part of Nprth American culture. And again, Bills season ticket holder"
humanhighlightreel,Pellies. They will have the best player in the league. There is no guarantee Wiggins will be top 10. 
humanhighlightreel,That's not what diminishing returns means. 
humanhighlightreel,"Absolutely agree. But to say that 16 of the 17 came from one game is ignoring the concept of point differential. Ignoring the fact that -6 came from the game before, ATL had a big win and WAS didn't, which is indicative that ATL outplayed WAS. 

Now, the Wall injury point is totally valid. As I said, if he meant they would have won with Wall healthy that is a different story. But outside of those excuses, ATL rightfully won. "
humanhighlightreel,ITT: ITTs
humanhighlightreel,"That's bull shit. He just had a brain fart and called Manu Euro because he looks, plays and sounds (within reason) like he is. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;You obviously don't watch Blazer games, or else you would know that when Aldridge passes out of a double team, it's to swing the ball around the perimeter to find the open man that the double came from. 

This is true of every post player in the NBA. You are right that Aldridge fairs better in terms of secondary assists in than he does by the above metrics, but he is still well behind Duncan, Dirk, both Gasols and in line with Blake. There is no doubt that Aldridge attracts as many double teams as anyone in the league, and this obviously creates open shots, he just isn't great at finding them and doesn't do so enough.

&gt;There is more to basketball than stats.

I agree, there is a lot more. I am not going to sit here and tell you that Aldridge is not a top 10 player because he is ~130th in BPM, ~40th in WS or ~30th in RPM (can't remember exact figures but those are close). I am not one of those guys. But statistical analysis is important as well, especially the kind I am doing. I am using the stats to back up my argument which was evident to the naked eye - Aldridge has tunnel vision when he gets the ball. Sure, the double teams he creates are great for getting the team open looks, but half the time he just shoots anyway and wastes that opportunity. Considering how much he has the ball and the minutes he plays, 16th among PFs in total passes... smh man that's awful, especially when you are the least efficient scorer on the starting lineup. Simple math will tell you that reallocating a bunch of those shots will benefit the team."
humanhighlightreel,Upvoted despite karma whoring. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, they got some luck. The Spurs did not show their age at all though - they were the second best team in the league by SRS this year they just had injuries to start the season - and the Clips and Rockets were both amazing teams. The Love injury was definitely beneficial, and so were OKC's issues, but other than that this season was par for the course. Would it have been better to see the Dubs and OKC duke it out in the WCF? Yes. But the Dubs still played in one of the toughest conferences ever and currently sit at 79-18. "
humanhighlightreel,"Because its not about individual players, its about the system. There always have been and always will be players who are less efficient from the line than their teams' offense as a whole. allowing teams to exploit that is completely irrational. At the end of the day, a foul is a breach of the rules, that is met with a penalty. A situation where a team is benefiting from these in fractions is evidence of a broken system. 

Making the ""learn to make a free throw"" argument just proves you are not an critical thinker. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, yeah. They would be a lot better. Bosh is a better shooter and defender than J-Smoove. He would shore up the defense while giving Harden more room to operate. They could also play him at C in hyper-efficient offensive lineups. 

"
humanhighlightreel,Yes
humanhighlightreel,"I can't take you seriously because your last post was ""there are no gays in Iran"" in /r/iran"
humanhighlightreel,"You can also get away with two traditional bigs when you have as much shooting at the 1-3 as PDX do (assuming Nic gets his jumper back a little). Their 7 best perimeter players are somewhere between good to elite 3 point shooters (Lillard, Mathews, 2014 Batum, McCollum, Afflalo, Blake, Wright)"
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, yeah, its hyperbole. They are in the NBA, and there are other teams in that league. Why do people here act as though hyperbole is a problem with a sentence, rather than a figure of speech. 

Regardless, what I meant to say is that they are the best team in the NBA by a really, really big margin. The only team in history to have a better SRS than them and *not* won the championship was the 1972 Bucks who lost to a team (Lakers) with an even better one. Further, none of those champs ever even had a series go to 7. 

Teams as good as the Warriors simply don't lose. Not because of jump shots, not because they haven't been there before, not because of nothin. The only way a top 10 team by SRS has ever lost a series in the playoffs was because of an injury to a marquee player (2013 Thunder). If that doesn't happen to the Dubs, they will not have a series go to seven - I will happily put a flair or signature bet (in addition to the copious amounts of money I have on them) on that. "
humanhighlightreel,Please do. I will happily do a flair bet that Dubs win in less than 7 games. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I feel that. And don't get me wrong I am grateful for all the feedback I got when I was developing it - this sub has some really smart, good people. But considering how much praise it received I was shocked when I posted the end of season results and it never sniffed the front page. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;The simple truth about that story: He stumbled into a moderately interesting story through dumb luck, and he did almost nothing with it. The entire published piece is a linear description of his own reporting process, which is basically him accidentally uncovering a bunch of private details. The praise was a reaction to the novelty. To the shock. It was not a response to the quality of the work itself.

That's fair. It was definitely luck, but still a cool read in my mind - transgender issues or none, and I maintain it was a well-written piece. I never claimed it to be ground-breaking journalism, just one of the most memorable Grantland pieces. 

But you called it abhorrent, and I still adamantly disagree with that. Other than his issues surrounding transgender pronoun use, I don't think there was any foul play. As you said, he basically stumbled into the story. He promised *the story* would be about the putter, and the initial iteration was - the fact that the story didn't make sense would cause any journalist to look a little deeper. Once he found out she was defrauding investors, in my opinion, all bets were off - the story had to be told. "
humanhighlightreel,"Frontrunners were OKC and Chi. He chose Chi because of OKC's lack of theatre. Unless OKC has made some power moves in the theatre industry in the least 10 months, then he made the right choice. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, it depends on your strategy. It is possible to stay goodish, but your peak will probably not be as high. The Lakers swung for the fences in 2013, and that was a smart move. After they did that, there was no way they weren't heading for the lottery eventually. "
humanhighlightreel,top 1 probably
humanhighlightreel,"I'm not fired up at all, I'm just chirping you for the ridiculousness of your comments. "
humanhighlightreel,Davis could tear both Achilles and someone would still give him the Mac 
humanhighlightreel,Yes. 
humanhighlightreel,"That's not homer, that's not understanding the gap between stats and winning basketball"
humanhighlightreel,"PG - if he is 100% healthy maybe, but there is a good chance he lost a bit of a step

Wall - plays way too stacked of a position, so I disagree, but its a fair debate.

LMA no way - He is wildly overrated and worse on both ends than Boogie

Bosh no way - he just missed a season and is not strong enough on the glass

Love no way - defense. "
humanhighlightreel,"but they aren't clutch plays. They were horribly off line shots. Clutch implies a good performance, not just a good result. "

humanhighlightreel,"People don't have Brook Lopez in their top 30 because his health makes him impossible to rate. A 100% healthy Brook in game shape is capable of doing what he did in the playoffs, or close to it, every game.

Playoff basketball is not that much different than regular season. Stats during it are heavily influenced by sample size and matchup. Regular season stats are much more indicative of future performance. "

humanhighlightreel,get a pass for what? this is the dumbest question I have ever seen. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, Mitch Richmond. "
humanhighlightreel,that's the point. its whoever had the ball. 
humanhighlightreel,"Ignoring the concept of ""burden of proof"", I will. 

Players are penalized for their inability to hit FTs within the confines of a reasonable basketball game. Rules that allow teams to exploit that weakness just don't make any sense.

We have rules in sports to transfer value between skillsets as we deem appropriate (as well as to protect athletes). In hockey, you are not allowed to hold, hook or slash players because the sport is better when skilled player, rather than just big goons, are able to flourish. Those rules transfer value from size and toughness to skill to an appropriate degree. If it was beneficial to do that even more, hockey would disallow body checking, but after many years it has become apparent to most people that the appropriate balance between those skills stops short of that. 

In basketball, when a player is fouled, they get free throws. Players who struggle to shoot are effectively awarded fewer bonus points as a result of the infraction, because shooting is an integral skill in the sport. However, it is not the only skill that matters. As it is, the rules allow for teams to transfer almost all the value of given possessions to a single skill - shooting - which is not for the betterment of the game. If it was, we would be watching the National 21 Association Playoffs.

I am all for hacking the shit out of a bad shooter when they have the ball. It was the offenses decision to trust them with the rock in pursuit of the goal - putting points on the board. But when a player doesn't have the ball, it can be assumed they are being tasked to provide value in all the other ways that makes basketball good. Allowing their opponent to transfer the emphasis of the sport from all those other skills to shooting is just plain dumb. "
humanhighlightreel,"Completely agree on all counts. If he hadn't left, he definitely would have had 9 years in a row. "
humanhighlightreel,they had better srs
humanhighlightreel,"not sure why anyone is downvoting you, you are absolutely right. "
humanhighlightreel,Jimmy is a s~~t~~pud. LeBron is a potato.
humanhighlightreel,"HARDEN IS GETTING TO THE LINE ON A HIGHER % OF HIS SCORING ATTEMPTS THIS SERIES THAN HE DID IN THE REGULAR SEASON. HE IS AVERAGING 27.4 PPG ON OVER 60% TRUE SHOOTING IN THE PLAYOFFS. 

THE ROCKET 105.8 ORTG IS PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE, AND IS SOLID WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW SHITTY DWIGHT HAS BEEN THIS SERIES. ITS THE FUCKING DEFENSE, NOT HARDEN, THAT IS CAUSING THEM TO LOSE.

I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean that is 100% true. It's possible that it would limit his options of teams, but with the success of sports injury recoveries in 2015 and the scarcity of superstars in the NBA, someone would take a gamble on him with a max deal. "
humanhighlightreel,The combine will have no impact on his draft stock. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean defense for an individual PG is just not nearly as important as offense. No way you can affect the game nearly as much. 

As I said, its arguable. If you are on a weaker team I would probably take Paul because he can guard the other teams best guard, and he can just take the offense himself. But on any contender I would rather have Curry, and that is worth more I think. "
humanhighlightreel,"00s Tier 1: Kobe, Duncan, Shaq, Garnett

00s Tier 2: Dirk*, Kidd, Iverson, Nash

*Dirk would be tier 1 if it were 2000-2015, but the ring in 2011 really put him in that category. Not sure he was before. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah Nique used to torch him
humanhighlightreel,how is it hard to say? any team would be better with a healthy Bosh
humanhighlightreel,"yeah! can't think of any time purges *weren't* a good idea, so let's do it"
humanhighlightreel,to win the Championship? no they weren't. 
humanhighlightreel,"in that case, the rule would not benefit the Hawks. "
humanhighlightreel,D12? Really? That would not be a great choice.
humanhighlightreel,"my bad, that was a typo. LeBron was really 2.599"
humanhighlightreel,"dude, no. you are talking about team style, not team ability. some teams like MEM prefer to go slow, so why would you want a stat to punish their equally efficient players? the more possessions you get, the more possessions that your opponent gets. "
humanhighlightreel,sorry yeah +750
humanhighlightreel,"He is one of the worst though. The only guys you can really argue might be worse are Rivers (LAC), Cole (Pellies), LaVine (Timberwolves), Chalmers (Heat), Wroten (6ers), and Larkin (Knicks) and 3 of those teams aren't trying to win. 

He fits what the Cavs are trying to do, so I have no problem paying him $800k and spending cash on other spots. But the next contract will probably be in the 2-4 million range, and I would rather just use the midlevel (or some of it) on one of the usual suspects - Aaron Brooks, Mo Williams, CJ Watson, DJ Augustine, or Jerryd Bayless. Those guys are all professional backup PGs, and they are all a lot better than Delly. 


"
humanhighlightreel,Still. the fact the Chicago is +900 and they are +1100 is insane. 
humanhighlightreel,depends on his group of squids
humanhighlightreel,"You're right, but I think he's mostly trying not to pay his opponent a complement mid series. He probably would have said the same about DeAndre Jordan, let alone 2014 Noah. "
humanhighlightreel,yes
humanhighlightreel,"haha no doubt. ""non-zero"" is his favorite term, I think. "
humanhighlightreel,"there is no such thing as clutch. there are players who don't crack under pressure, and Kobe is certainly one of them. however, he has also taken a lot of dumb hero ball shots so his % is low. "
humanhighlightreel,"so a significant % of the time? 

you out-Lowe'd yourself. "
humanhighlightreel,"On the hypothetical GM criteria. Its the best method for these kinds of questions. You're a GM and all three guys are entering a fantasy draft the same year, knowing full well how good they will become. Who do you draft?
"
humanhighlightreel,Stu Lantz is a slut
humanhighlightreel,And I am telling you you are wrong. 
humanhighlightreel,dude what are you talking about. a 1 inch pebble weighs maybe a gram. water is definitely dense enough to hold up a 1 gram rock. 
humanhighlightreel,Jay Bilas. 
humanhighlightreel,DAT RIM PROTECTION
humanhighlightreel,"Except LeBron actually plays the point slightly more than Kyrie does. He brings the ball up 13 times per game to Kyrie's 12, he has the ball 17% of his court time compared to 16% for Kyrie, and he has a markedly higher assist %. 

It is basically a dead even split, but if anyone is the Cavs PG on offense it is LeBron, not Kyrie. "
humanhighlightreel,Do you want Winlsow? You have so many athletes who aren't great shooters already. 
humanhighlightreel,Damnit you beat me. 
humanhighlightreel,"....fuck no?

but every year a shit ton of undrafted players play in the NBA, and only Starks and Wallace have been All Stars.

either way your post was shitty and added no value, which is basically what I said. "

humanhighlightreel,"Yes, I agree with that and never said that there was. I said you accusing me of recency bias because I held a very valid opinion was bullshit. I never said your opinion was bullshit. "
humanhighlightreel,Never said I'd let him fuck me
humanhighlightreel,"recency bias /s

but in all honesty this sub does have an insanely short memory. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, but they have Draymond, and are a better team than the Spurs. "
humanhighlightreel,especially given the fact u can't trade back to back firsts
humanhighlightreel,Kobe wasn't better than Duncan or Garnett in 2005. 2006-2009 I agree. The 2005 Timberwolves were the 11th best team in the league; Lakers were 22. Garnett's cast was not even much better than Kobe's.
humanhighlightreel,he is a damn good coach because he made the adjustments that fans and the media knew were necessary in May? that doesn't sound damn good at all. 
humanhighlightreel,"not if he keeps shooting 52%. Dwight has shot badly in the playoffs, if he was shooting 52.8% the strategy would be poor. NBA teams average about 1.056 points per 100, and their percentages are right around there. Once you factor in the lack of transition offense, its clearly not a good look at 52%"
humanhighlightreel,"Would not trade Blake for them. 

I wouldn't trade them for Blake either, mind you. I value them all around equally long term (all are better than Blake, but LeBron cause of age; Curry and Harden because PG is so deep), and the trade would not be worth reforming your team around a different type of star. "
humanhighlightreel,"On reddit you get downvoted for saying anything negative about any team or player, unless its on the approved list of things to hate on. No normal person would call those teams great. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, being a national hero has nothing to do with being a better basketball player, but I can believe he was better than Nene for sure. "
humanhighlightreel,"a lot of people talk about this a lot, just not on /r/nba"
humanhighlightreel,"It would be a hell of a series. I would say Dubs in 7, because they are the better team, but for whatever reason I can't pick against 2013 LeBron. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, I said shot-blocking was a redundant skill set. I never implied they had identical skill sets. That was just your interpretation.  "
humanhighlightreel,"I would also take D Wade. He is a smarter basketball player than Russ on both ends, and has a way better post game. When you are 7'1 anyway, I would rather a heady 8/10 athlete than a less heady 10/10. "
humanhighlightreel,"yeah 7x is usually the arbitrary threshold, but given that he wasn't even close to deserving #7 based on his play (only talent and reputation), I think it would be fair to snub him. "
humanhighlightreel,"I don't speak for, or own, any team. I am speaking *about* the New York Knicks and their fans. "
humanhighlightreel,he look like a lil alien stole his talent. 
humanhighlightreel,"and the argument that the Rockets are losing because Harden likes to get to the line is retarded rhetoric with no statistical, or qualitative backing of any kind. "
humanhighlightreel,"My point is just that Harden plays PG. He has the ball over 16% of the time he is on the court, more than Steph, he initiates basically every offensive set and he is their primary pick and roll threat. He rarely hangs out on the wing without the ball. He is a point guard through and through, he just happens to guard (if you want to call it that lol Haren amirite?) wings.

And I think he is a better player than Russ. If he is a PG, and he is a better player, he is a better PG. 

For the record though, I also think he is a better passer. He is the third best in the league per my [NBA Passer Rating](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) stat. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's the point. But its Toronto, man. I have been drinking in bars/clubs here since I was 15.  I assume it was the older guys on the team being dicks; same reason they brought me in through the back but made their actual teammates wait in the public line for an hour. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"I still think that's typical overrating of Kobe, but won't argue it as adamantly. "
humanhighlightreel,"You probably don't follow basketball enough. It doesn't get talked about as much as LMA, Marc or love, but it is still a very common discussion. "
humanhighlightreel,"They were the 8th best team in the league. Not saying its not an accomplishment, but getting to the Finals when your best win is a 7 gamer against the leagues 8th best team doesn't happen every year. 

It should also be noted he did that his team had an elite defense. Saying they were a very average team without him ignores the fact that it was built to maximize his ability - namely that he was a one man offense who struggled to play within a team identity. The fact that the stars aligned to get him to the Finals in the easiest year I can remember is pretty convenient. If that team were assembled in the Western Conference, people would be remembering AI as a gunner who never won shit, because based on SRS they would have been a 7 seed and played Sacramento, then San Antonio, then LA. Don't see them winning there. People often refuse to acknowledge how much luck matters in sports. For most of his career AI was not that type of player. 

Again, I think he played very well in those playoffs, but no way he was good enough to "
humanhighlightreel,because he's about to get banned
humanhighlightreel,"And Duncan is definitely comparable to Garnett defensively when you are looking at their careers, but I think that in his prime Garnett was a step above on that end. "
humanhighlightreel,I think you guys are the clear favorite *if* he decides to leave. 
humanhighlightreel,"I dunno, you can make and argument for LeBron as well. I would have gone Curry, Harden, LeBron, but I am not going to insult anyone who put him in the top 2 - they obviously just have a slightly different interpretation of the award than I do. 

Putting Curry at 5 though?!?!?"
humanhighlightreel,nope
humanhighlightreel,1 per team
humanhighlightreel,"Nah Aldridge just happens to be the most overrated player in the league. He is an incredibly talented scorer, but its all does on offense. Literally as soon as you give him the ball on the low block, you know he is shooting it - double team or not. Its great when he goes off (like in last years' playoffs, which made him so overrated), but most of the time he is just wasting possessions. It is unacceptable to play on a lineup that good, and have a USG% of 30 and a TS% of 52. He plays with blinders on, which is not something you want in an NBA that currently stresses ball movement. I think there is a ton of Ewing Theory potential if he leaves the Blazers. He has all this talent surrounding him and doesn't make it any better. 

There is a reason he is 44th in WS/48, 26th in RPM, 134th in BPM, 140th in WP"
humanhighlightreel,That's some pretty bad spacing doe. 
humanhighlightreel,"Right, the point is that Michael leaving the league in his prime, then coming back is an anomaly that this method can't account for. "
humanhighlightreel,"JR was good on the Knicks when they were a 2-seed too. If he is on a functional offense he is a money spot up shooter who can catch fire, and can hurt you a bit off the bounce. If he isn't he tries to do way too much and sucks. This is how its always been. The less required of him, the more he will provide. "
humanhighlightreel,"Cool Jared, nobody fucking cares. "
humanhighlightreel,"Right now, yes. But in 2013, definitely not. 

You have to consider that 2 top 10 players take up twice as much cap space than the number one player. "
humanhighlightreel,"If you are providing more value than somebody else, you are better than them. I don't think Nash was providing more value than Kobe, but if he was he would be better. "
humanhighlightreel,"Team A - No spacing; too many ball dominant players

Team B - Poor defense; three bigs would get torched

Team C - Unstoppable; perfect fitting

Team D - Unbelievable defense

It is definitely between C and D. It would be offense vs. defense. I like C because I think MJ and AI would be miserable together, personality-wise.

"
humanhighlightreel,"would *have* had a shot at being 3rd. 

sorry, pet peeve. "
humanhighlightreel,"For Boogie:

PG: John Wall

SG: Kyle Korver

SF: Kawhi Leonard

PF: Serge Ibaka

I want Ibaka-Boogie more than anything. Boogie is fine on defense at the 5 now, but having an elite weak-side helper would be phenomenal. On offense Serge can basically get out of the way and drain. "
humanhighlightreel,"I think it will  be a while before anyone is a favorite against LeBron, but I can totally see it happening with the Bulls and Pacers, and Bucks in about 3 years too. "
humanhighlightreel,"I agree, but none of these guys are great. I will take Ty and deal with perimeter D later, personally. "
humanhighlightreel,"I am saying you could put the stadium an hour outside the city, and people would still go. "
humanhighlightreel,How so? Can you just tell me what is confusing you? 
humanhighlightreel,ah. fair enough. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah like calling the Bucs every year lol. He is definitely smart, but is too numbers oriented. Mays is right more often, and less arrogant about his opinions. "
humanhighlightreel,"I concur.  I would say it was actually hilarious, if slightly unsportsmanlike. "
humanhighlightreel,Okafor - 18/8/2 on 54/-/59
humanhighlightreel,"Definitely. The two best examples are Jordan and Kareem, but you are right. "
humanhighlightreel,"Wittman has once again done enough, in the nick of time, to keep his job. That sucks for Wizards fans, because he is not a good coach. Yes, he has made the necessary adjustments in time for the playoffs, but they have been obvious ones all year. "
humanhighlightreel,"50s: Mikan, Pettit, Arizin, Johnson

humanhighlightreel,Also shoutout to Brandan Wright for starting and SG *and* backing up Len. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Ayy lmao fam

Are you fucking serious?"
humanhighlightreel,"yes it would. Chris Paul is 30, and the Clips are trying to win now. Griffin to LMA is a pretty huge downgrade and would hurt them during his tenure. You don't give up a top 5 player for a top 20 one just so you can get a younger 6th man and a backup. "
humanhighlightreel,"As I said elsewhere, pre-meningitis he was borderline elite. Amidst the coaching drama he was significantly worse, but he still proved he can do it. "
humanhighlightreel,ew
humanhighlightreel,"there are 3 teams, but also LeBron James, Kawhi, etc. so you are right. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"I would take Lawson of the three. He is wildly underrated. 

But I would take Conley over Teague. Teague looked great this year, but every player he was playing with could shoot and pass - it makes a PG's job a lot easier. Conley is better on both ends IMO. "
humanhighlightreel,definitely posted by a salty hater
humanhighlightreel,are you religious or some shit?
humanhighlightreel,"He is entitled to be upset. Its unreasonable to not even hear out someone's apology after they accidentally injured you. Even if you think it was intentional, he has no reason not to give Olynyk the benefit of the doubt, and at the very least here him out. 

Love is a bitch. 

EDIT: Nobody who played sports would be downvoting this. When somebody accidentally injures you in sports it is common courtesy to accept their apology - just like it is common courtesy to apologize to someone if you accidentally injure them. I have been on both sides of that phone call, once after a guy shredded my kidney on a really dirty hit - it was so bad I went into kidney failure two days later and had to go on dialysis. I accepted his apology immediately, because these things happen in sports. It was a dirty hit, but I know he didn't want to injure me, and he was remorseful, so it was a no brainer. I myself have been a bit reckless on the court, field and ice, and am lucky enough to have never *seriously* injured someone. But if I ever were in that situation, where there was no intent to harm, I would hope that the victim would extend me the same courtesy I extended the guy who hit me. Its called sportsmanship. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, there are a lot of ways Howard could contribute outside the confines of the team's system and he isn't. 

At the end of the day, without Bev your defense takes a hit, and the Harden-centric offense is just not viable in the playoffs without a secondary ball handler. Josh Smith's mirage of a shooting stroke helped mask things against a dysfunctional Dallas defense, but you guys just didn't have the goods in this series. 

And as I said, he was solid this season - the offense was infinitely better than last year. No way he gets fired. "
humanhighlightreel,"Wholeheartedly disgree with your friend. He is a supremely talented guard toiling away on a mediocre team. Offensively, he works on or off the ball (key in this league) as a great jump shooter and arguably the [best passer](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) in the NBA. He creates a ton of offense for himself and others, is consistent game to game, and has remained a positive force through roster and coaching turmoil. It is much easier to look good when you are surrounded by lethal shooters and have a beautiful offensive identity. Defensively Ty is bad, but a bad defensive PG can be hidden; he is far ahead of Teague on the other end. "
humanhighlightreel,It is the only category in which he was superior to LeBron. 
humanhighlightreel,"Sorry poor word choice. Edited. I meant it was a fluke - nothing wrong with that it happens in ball and the Bulls deserved the game. Just saying people shouldn't be like ""Rose is back!!!""

Also get out of ere with that DD shit. You think that insults me? I didn't hire him. The fact that your comment is up voted is embarrassing. "
humanhighlightreel,"OK, now that you clarify third *star*, then yes. You are probably right. Though they would need at least a few decent shooters and defenders. Average role players at least."
humanhighlightreel,recency bias /s
humanhighlightreel,No. What if they threw the match and then LeBron got hurt in game 5. All of a sudden you have a series. Win and move on.
humanhighlightreel,I played D1 football. 
humanhighlightreel,Yeah but its a hell of a lot higher than any other high-income demographic.

humanhighlightreel,No there wasn't. The regular season and playoffs are so much more similar than people think. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah but interior D is by far the most important spots. Hakeem and Garnett vs. Shaq and Duncan is not that close if we are going by primes, and MJ is lockdown as fuck too. "
humanhighlightreel,"No it doesn't. It isn't picking players in order, it picks 14 *random* players out of 60. That is what a binomial distribution does. "
humanhighlightreel,"Not sure that would qualify for Ewing Theory, as it usually refers to teams who rely too much on a star. Love only has 22% USG"
humanhighlightreel,"I would diversify my diction, but it is truly the only word that fully encapsulates the way Love is acting right now. "
humanhighlightreel,"He can legitimately field an 11 man defense (with a sub), and Travis Henry can field an 11 man offense. 

EDIT: I just want to point out that while Cromartie is the undisputed leader in total kids, his kid/babymomma ratio of 1.5:1 pales in comparison to Henry's 1.1:1. Henry would even have a perfect 1:1 were it not for one of his babymommas having twins. "
humanhighlightreel,"yeah, I would be asking this. 

And i am having no trouble dealing with it I had money line on the bulls"
humanhighlightreel,"The fact that Memphis can't run is reflected in GSW players' efficiency numbers. You are terrible at math. 

If you are a team that plays better going fast, playing fast is obviously a good thing. But the fact that it is making you more effective with each possession is reflected in per 100 possession numbers. The only thing that isn't is the fact that you have more possessions (read: opportunities to put up stats). And it shouldn't be, because every additional possession is also one for you opponent. 

Just because GSW is smart to play fast here, because playing fast gives them an edge that makes them more efficient in this matchup, doesn't mean faster is better. 5/10 of the ten fastest teams didn't even make the playoffs. "
humanhighlightreel,"That series was basically a pick 'em. And the main reason OKC lost was due to coaching. Brooks refused to match Miami's small lineups and Perk got abused over and over. 

This is a much different year, and really, the Warriors and 2012 Thunder could not be more dissimilar."
humanhighlightreel,"LeBron is the greatest ever. 

Wow, that was easy. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;But what do I know?

nothing."
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;passer, dribbler, fast breaker, dunker

All elements of offense. I edited to say in the regular season (though not sure why) to make you happy. "
humanhighlightreel,Nah Sammy is better
humanhighlightreel,jesus were you living under a rock? or in a shoe perhaps?
humanhighlightreel,"No because he doesn't bring the defense and intensity that Houston need, and would get from P-Bev. Also not having Donuts is a much bigger problem than people realise
"
humanhighlightreel,"why, why do you insist on making us look this way?"
humanhighlightreel,"Phil Jackson made a dumb comment about teams who shoot a lot of threes not doing well in the playoffs and has now constructed a straw man to cover his ass. Nobody ever suggested that teams who can't get penetration (which happens to be the best way to generate open 3 point shots) or teams who rely *solely* on the three can succeed in the playoffs (hell, teams like that can't succeed in the regular season, either). He should just appreciate that he said something dumb (that was made dumber by his use of ""goink"") and keep his mouth shut on the issue. "
humanhighlightreel,This is just not true at all. It is very well documented that Thibs was livid. 
humanhighlightreel,"OK. I don't know what you don't understand about the term shooting slump, but w/e. Think what you want."
humanhighlightreel,"If he is still contributing, how would it negatively affect his legacy?"
humanhighlightreel,"Why? Lowry is still a good player when healthy, but this team is miles from contending. There is no point in building around a 29 year old short PG who isn't a great passer or shooter (i.e. there is nothing in his game that will age particularly well). We had to go for it a bit this year for the city's sake, but Masai knew what he was doing when he only signed people to short and/or movable deals last summer. It would obviously depend on the fillers, but T-Jones would be a great start for a package to move Lowry for. That said, I would not do it this summer as his value is at a low. "
humanhighlightreel,"It would be very close, but I'm taking Ky with his handle. I have played Kyrie one on one. It is not fun. "
humanhighlightreel,Don't be an idiot
humanhighlightreel,I know a few things
humanhighlightreel,and Timothy Duncan
humanhighlightreel,"PER basically takes the box score and attempts to boil a players statistical contribution to a single number. The name is a bit of a misnomer, as the stat overvalues players with high counting stats, but it is named as such as it is based on rate statistics (rebound rate, usage rate, etc). 

It is certainly somewhat of an antiquated stat, as it does not take advantage of any player tracking, nor the advanced +/- stats that were born out of xRAPM (though those also have their share of critics). The basketball community has also trended towards using player tracking and situational stats to dig deeper into how players handle certain roles and situations rather than trying to assign a number to their overall ability, which is an impossible task. 

It is also noted that it gives players too great of an advantage for high usage. 

It should be used as little more than a quick way to contextualize whether a players' box score is good or bad. "
humanhighlightreel,...they don't even play on the same team.
humanhighlightreel,"so every foul, the team gets to decide who would shoot?

wouldn't make much of a difference to rosters. you wouldn't waste a roster spot on a random dude who could shoot 95% when each team usually has a guy who can shoot ~90%. at most it would make borderline players who can shoot FTs well (think Seth Curry) more likely to make a team."
humanhighlightreel,People debate whether it actually works literally all the time on here. And it is a very close debate. 
humanhighlightreel,"Well done, folks. Except /u/ilikemerice . you fucked up"
humanhighlightreel,Two different sources inside my head have told me in the last two weeks that Phil Jackson is losing his mind. And that's coming from a guy with sources in his head. 
humanhighlightreel,"Its a dumb, arbitrary award. Why would the best bench player deserve an award? Why not have a 52nd Most Valuable Player trophy instead?

NBA awards suck. MIP is retarded too this isn't a middle school sports banquet. "
humanhighlightreel,No need to resort to that NHL playoffs are on. 
humanhighlightreel,"Its based on the binomial theorem, but when you are using it to describe the chances that something will happen once, you just have to determine the chances of it *not* happening (or 7 choose 0) and subtract from 1. That makes things very simple, since the chances of something not happening 7 times are always the chances of it not happening once, raised to 7. Since he got a trip dub on 15.87% of his games, the chances of him not getting one 7 times are 84.13%^7 =30.03%"
humanhighlightreel,"I think that's a pretty bold pick. ROY is a pretty offense-based award, and his offensive game is pretty unrefined. "
humanhighlightreel,and last year in the playoffs he was pretty weak defensively and much better offensively. he cannot consistently be elite on both ends anymore IMO. too much tread on the tires. 
humanhighlightreel,"2 years ago I would agree with you on SAC, but after this year I am not sure Boogie needs a defensive minded C beside him. He has gotten legitimately good on D and will keep improving. Putting a C beside him would hurt him tremendously on O. "
humanhighlightreel,"Right, and they are penalized for their inability to hit FTs within the confines of a reasonable basketball game. Rules that allow teams to exploit that weakness just don't make any sense. 

Its like having a rule that if you have a little white PG he has to guard your opponents best player every possession."
humanhighlightreel,poo or penis?
humanhighlightreel,I think you just don't understand how much less impact a guard can have on defense than they can on offense. 
humanhighlightreel,"Than any true 4 in history, realistically. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's not the closest thing we have to a good rivalry, it just so happens a lot of the best ones don't involve two good teams right now. Only a few years ago historic rivalries like the Lakers-Celts and Knicks-Pacers were relevant. And we still have Bulls-Cavs and Rockets-Mavs"
humanhighlightreel,what the fuck does rooting have to do with anything?
humanhighlightreel,"Clips are 18-2 because the vast majority of the time it is used, the team using it is behind. If more teams started using it when ahead it would prove very effective IMO."
humanhighlightreel,I am saying that anyone who hasn't played in the NBA probably isn't the best scorer ever. If you disagree you obviously aren't very smart. 
humanhighlightreel,he also got injured a ton in his prime.
humanhighlightreel,"But there have always been players who struggle to hit FTs, and there always  will be. Think of it this way: FT shooting stayed the same, but offenses improved in other ways, it would get even worse. "
humanhighlightreel,[here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=michael+jordan)
humanhighlightreel,"Dude, when somebody accidentally injures you in sports it is common courtesy to accept their apology - just like it is common courtesy to apologize to someone if you accidentally injure them. I have been on both sides of that phone call, once after a guy shredded my kidney so bad I went into kidney failure and had to go on dialysis cause of a dirty hit. I accepted his apology immediately, because these things happen in sports.

If reddit had more athletes and less neckbeards, it would be the pro-Love comments being downvoted. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, I mean you can argue either way. His competition was much better in 95. But its a lot harder to dominate offensively the way he did when the only other real offensive threat was Vernon Maxwell and Kenny Smith's jumper."
humanhighlightreel,"I agree Melo isn't terrible, but having two ground-bound PFs makes things tough. Elite defensive Cs aren't that easy to find. 

Fit is poor on offense as well. "
humanhighlightreel,"Paul has played that way his whole career. Its what he does. He dribbles around until a scoring option opens up, or he does it himself. He is the best I have ever seen at doing that, but it puts too much of a burden on him and causes the team to live and die with him. Moving the ball earlier in the possession would result in fewer assists, but more varied looks."
humanhighlightreel,What people are saying has no effect on their potential 
humanhighlightreel,"You would take AD over Harden, right now? "
humanhighlightreel,"The one thing to consider about Reggie though is that he averaged 18 a game on 60% TS for a Finals team at 34. Guy didn't have a HOF prime, but he stayed good forever. Even at 39 he averaged 15 a game in 30 minutes on 58% TS. 

I agree the HOF shouldn't be so liberal, but I think there are a few guys who would get cut before him because of his incredible longevity. "
humanhighlightreel,"No I realize that and know all about Oscar. I am genuinely curious as to whether you guys think he would be considered better than Nene, had he come to America. 

...how the fuck was this comment downvoted? *Genuinely curious*"
humanhighlightreel,OMG
humanhighlightreel,"I wouldn't take him over Bosh, Melo or PG either, but that's why I said this season. Kyrie is a huge boost. "
humanhighlightreel,"sample size, mostly. it was mainly a shooting slump. the Rockets have played him well, but he usually hits some of those even against stellar D. he got going last night though. "
humanhighlightreel,"That is completely valid. LMA does not move the ball well enough within that system. That whole starting lineup can score, yet LMA insists on trying to score over double teams consistently and doesn't have the vision to find his teammates out of them (I have him rated as the league's 226th best passer by my [NBA Passer Rating](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) stat).  He is the least efficient starter by a solid margin, yet has a USG% over 30.

I think a good high post passer like Millsap or Monroe would really bring out the initiating abilities of Lillard and Batum. That team was built for a motion offense - with 3 perimeter guys who can shoot, pass and score in a multitude of ways - but LMA makes that impossible. "
humanhighlightreel,I know with absolute certainty he is. 
humanhighlightreel,where are the other 2? 
humanhighlightreel,lol
humanhighlightreel,Laettner made an ASG. Would hardly call him mediocre. 
humanhighlightreel,"Harden and Marc are the best. 

Good job. "
humanhighlightreel,could have. 
humanhighlightreel,agree to disagree. 
humanhighlightreel,"ok, but you are wrong. "
humanhighlightreel,"1. Kyrie

2. Kobe if healthy

3. Melo

4. LMA

5. Big Al"
humanhighlightreel,Yeah I mean LeBron does that too .
humanhighlightreel,"He is no sloppier with the ball than any of the league's other top point guards (except CP3), and he is one of the best passers in the NBA."
humanhighlightreel,"ATL - Wall is hurt and they're better anyway. WAS looks really good, but the ball movement I saw from ATL last game was reminiscent of their hot run, even if the shots didn't always fall.

CLE - LeBron. Will be close though. 

GSW - In 5

LAC - They have been the better team w/o CP3 and were better all season.

"
humanhighlightreel,"playoff coaches get fired all the time. probably the dumbest meme I have ever seen, playoff fan. "
humanhighlightreel,"to be fair, he is a good fit next to Harden for the same reasons. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah but Ebola is pretty good too
humanhighlightreel,"yes. players are infinitely better than they were in the 70's, when nobody outside of a few cities gave a flying fuck about basketball. the talent pool has exploded, and so have players' skills. that is just logic. "
humanhighlightreel,does this dude not have twitter? I googled him to see if he had posted an explanation - didn't find him. 
humanhighlightreel,"It is just mind boggling to me that one could prefer baseball to hockey, basketball, soccer or football. There is no difference between the game and the ESPN game cast in that sport. "
humanhighlightreel,"Jameson.

Jameson Curry. "
humanhighlightreel,"94 Hakeem. He lead his team in pts, ast, reb, stl, blk that year, and he played in a real conference. "
humanhighlightreel,&gt;in the US
humanhighlightreel,you're silly
humanhighlightreel,"eh, the first three words I can appreciate. not sure where you got bandwagoner from."
humanhighlightreel,oh true dat
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, he certainly identifies more as Argentine. "
humanhighlightreel,"I literally made the point you just countered me with. 

If they met w/o Love, Cavs would probably be a slight favorite and could possibly lose. "
humanhighlightreel,"We both know Bibby got to the finals.

But even if you're right, that still means there are 4 better guys at his position. Wallace was an All Star starter. There was only 1. "
humanhighlightreel,"No, I watch him a lot. "
humanhighlightreel,"As I said, there would be no chance of him taking a QO given what you said. Him taking a short term deal to take advantage of the rising cap would increase his earning potential. 

However, the pels haven't been bad enough for him to do that - I was just arguing the guy who basically said it could never happen. "
humanhighlightreel,That would be an awful trade for the Clippers
humanhighlightreel,ok
humanhighlightreel,i like dat
humanhighlightreel,"Definitely not more impressive than Hardens (he wasn't nearly as good, just played more minutes and had higher USG), but I agree with #2. "
humanhighlightreel,"No, I am more a fan of the NBA than I am a fan of the Raps, and I have been going to Raps game since the first one. One of the great things about the NBA is the way it showcases the styles and personalities of its athletes, and I like to watch them all, and the most entertaining ones most frequently. I will never cheer for another team over the Raps and I watch at least as many of their games as any other team, so I guess I am basketball monogamous, but if I wasn't from the 6 I would definitely be like you. 

(note: I don't actually call it the 6)"
humanhighlightreel,"That would not happen. 

1. It would be very difficult to time.

2. You risk him going right back up with it, in which case you forfeit 2 points *and* a shot. 

Also, who even cares? If he comes down with a rebound, you can just foul him legally. He has the damn ball. "
humanhighlightreel,"Disagree. Geography, history of the team, and many other factors can affect the behavior of a fanbase. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah he will pretty much be the second best any way you slice it. 
humanhighlightreel,"because teams wouldn't have the incentive to tank. look at the teams that would have a decent shot at a high pick - the middling teams like DEN, SAC, DET need it just as much as the tankers. Your record is not an accurate reflection of your teams' future state in the NBA for lottery teams. "
humanhighlightreel,"Wow, that is a really good argument. I never thought about it like that before. You are probably right. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Grow up.

Perfect words for Kevin Love. "
humanhighlightreel,"Being the better team by a fair margin helps, though"
humanhighlightreel,"Not necessarily, I just know that Rio had a lot of poor shooting stretches where he noticeably lost confidence. You can also point to his gay ass tweets about Love this year. The dude is far from perfect. "
humanhighlightreel,"More fouls, more and-1s more injuries. 

There are certainly times where players should have made a defensive play, but didn't, but for the most part they are making the right choice. "
humanhighlightreel,But he missed his target by a shit load. Rimming out would be more clutch than banking it because the intentional element of the shot is closer to your goal. 
humanhighlightreel,i feel like the tone of your post is suggesting it was a bad choice. If Bogut never shattered his elbow (or had the other injuries) it is likely that only CP3 would have had a better career form that years draft. Paul was 6 foot nothing. It was not an unreasonable choice at all. 
humanhighlightreel,DeAndre is not even close to deserving of this. Perfect other than that. 
humanhighlightreel,Jimmy Chitwood
humanhighlightreel,"I don't really see how he fits the Kobe/MJ bill. He hasn't shown much of a post game, and he isn't nearly as smooth a scorer. I see Chief Justise as more of a Kawhi-type player than a go-to scorer. "
humanhighlightreel,He's no Sammy Watkins that's for sure. 
humanhighlightreel,"Australia: Andrew ~~Gaze~~ Bogut
"
humanhighlightreel,bout tree fiddy
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah you are right he is probably BPA. I guess you draft him and make a deal down the line. I think he will be a better pro than Gordon, so maybe you ship AG off with someone for a marquee big. AG, Vuc and a pick for Boogie maybe. Payton/Dipo/Chief/Frye/Boogie would be a force on both ends. "
humanhighlightreel,"LeBron, Durant, Curry, Harden, Paul, Davis, Griffin, Westbrook (8) are definitely better than him. 

Cousins, Love, Wall, M. Gasol (4) are probably better than him 

Bosh, George, LMA, Dirk, Wade, Thompson, Butler, Leonard, Irving, Howard (10) are probably not better than him. 

So he is in the range of 9-20. I would say probably around 12 or 13. "
humanhighlightreel,"How is that the end of the story? AI was incredible that playoffs, but they were part of a much different career. Further, he beat some really mediocre teams that year - the 18th, 14th and 8th best teams in the league by SRS - before losing in 5 to the Lakers. And the series against #13 and #8 took 7 games a piece. To say that run ends the story against a guy with much better stats is pretty ridiculous. "
humanhighlightreel,"With all due respect, Mr. Dennit, I had no idea you'd gotten experimental surgery to have your balls removed."
humanhighlightreel,"not okafor

- /r/nba 

"
humanhighlightreel,woah
humanhighlightreel,New Orleans has Anthony Davis. 
humanhighlightreel,are you fucking kidding me?
humanhighlightreel,"Millsap would be a great fit, but he is not the guy to take the torch from Duncan. If Pop could harness Aldridge's post up ability and teach him how to move the ball better and take fewer dumb shots, the Spurs can be true contenders for another 5 or so years with him and Kawhi. Millsap would make them a slightly better version of what they are now.  "
humanhighlightreel,ask the mods.
humanhighlightreel,That still makes him 168 in dog years. He's pretty good for 168. 
humanhighlightreel,That explains until 1989 - what about after? Doesn't seem like his stats dropped off in his 30's so shouldn't have been a big issue. 
humanhighlightreel,Both.
humanhighlightreel,"In addition to a lot of the things mentioned here before, the Wizards terrible offensive systems were a huge contributor. "
humanhighlightreel,he's not lying
humanhighlightreel,"You missed the point (and also rambled nonsensically a bunch). 

The point is that while FT shooting is fundamental to the game, so are a lot of other skills. Some players can't shoot threes, some players can't rebound, some players can't play defense. 

With those three skills, a team is allowed to make up for those deficiencies. Can't shoot threes? Don't. Can't rebound, put other players on the floor who can, can't play defense? Hide that player on the other teams worse player. All of those things are fundamental skills, but other than LeBron fucking James nobody excels at all of them. Sure, teams can use players' deficiencies to their advantage, but players can make up for those in other ways. 

The problem with the hack-a-shaq rules, is that a team can make a possession about *one single skill* rather than all-around basketball ability. That does not make sense. What is so special about FT shooting that it should be allowed to be the only skill you can do this for? Why isn't there a rule saying that your little white PG who can't play defense has to guard a certain player? Is defense not fundamental? 

That is the point of my argument - it is not in the spirit of the sport to put that much emphasis on a single skill or weakness. My hockey example was just to say that those things are outlawed because if they weren't, there would be too much emphasis on size and strength (your application of the rule was far too specific and made zero sense). 

"
humanhighlightreel,"No, pretty much everyone whose sense of humor extends beyond repetition and memes. "
humanhighlightreel,"which is pretty much what coordinated means. he isn't completely clumsy, but for a professional athlete he is very uncoordinated. "
humanhighlightreel,More like dumb theory 
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, he can handle his own offensively. That is not the same as saying an offensive beast. He is an excellent finisher and has decent range, but he has a one track mind the minute he touches the rock - shoot, shoot, shoot. He is another player that greatly disrupts quality ball movement. My [NBA Passer Rating](https://m.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) stat has him as the 8th worst passer in the league, too. He is an unwilling and ineffective ball mover. 

Overall, he is a good scorer and decent rebounder but provides nothing else. He is a borderline NBA starter and would have little to no effect on Durant's decision. "
humanhighlightreel,"If they had healthy Wall I would probably have them winning series, but w/o I just don't see it. "
humanhighlightreel,"There is a very strong chance of my statement being correct. If there was a true big man that could dribble like blake back in the 50s-70s, we would probably know about it. When a theory or opinion is very close to being known, it is convention for people to state it as fact unless it is an academic paper. 

You could literally making the argument that you are currently making on 95% of the posts on here (**NOTE: 95% IS AN ESTIMATE, AND MY OPINION. IT IS NOT A STATEMENT OF FACT. PLEASE DO NOT POST ON THIS COMMENT SAYING I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS STATISTIC IS ACCURATE.**). Feel free to spend your life doing that. "
humanhighlightreel,"Because he is a much better basketball player. Cauley-Stein is a Jr. with no offensive game. He is a great athlete, but he isn't DeAndre Jordan. "
humanhighlightreel,"Again, TIL one-dimensional teams do not win championships. 

This is really groundbreaking stuff. We need to get you on ESPN. "
humanhighlightreel,"1. Let refs deem which fouls are intentional like in the last two minutes (most realistic)

2. Have off-ball fouls result in FTs for whoever last possessed the ball (most logical, somewhat realistic)

3. When a team is in the bonus, let them choose between the shots and the ball on non-shooting fouls (interesting as it would also make ends of games less whistle heavy and perhaps more fair, pretty unrealistic as it would change the sport quite drastically and people are resistant to change)"
humanhighlightreel,"Agree to disagree. I think that on a bad team he can look OK, but I think he has exactly zero value. 

If he doesn't have the ball in his hands, he really kills your spacing. He can't shoot a lick, and isn't a smart cutter, so teams just ignore him. If he does have the ball in his hands, he can make a few good plays, but will ultimately do as much harm as good (turnovers and bad midrange shots). 

A player like that has no value on a starting lineup, because most teams have a much better primary ball-handler than him. The Celtics happened to be in need of someone like that (Bradley is not a primary ball-handler, Smart is a rookie) so he appeared to make them better. But he is still one of the worst options in the league for that role.  

The Pacers tried to re-purpose him as sixth man, but we all know how that turned out. 

Every team he has played on has been worse with him on the court than on the bench. He has a few NBA skills, so to the casual observer he looks like a dude who can play. But ultimately, he is not a guy you want on your team if you are trying to win. 

Ask any contending GM what they would give up for Evan Turner, and I guarantee that answer will be ZERO.

There is a reason the Celtics signed him to the deal they did - to help them get better draft picks (didn't work) and as stopgap salary for the big cap explosion of 2016."
humanhighlightreel,"That was in a civil suit. Physical evidence wasn't much and her refusal to testify is pretty indicative. Regardless, courts never ruled on it so neither will I. "
humanhighlightreel,I don't see a problem with Shaq vs. Charles. Shaq is lucky to be an 8 seed and Charles is an obvious 1. Chuck will probably destroy him. 
humanhighlightreel,contrarianism. 
humanhighlightreel,Analysts and colour for the most part
humanhighlightreel,"then yes, Vegas is definitely more accurate than reddit, you, or any other source you might find. "
humanhighlightreel,"Okafor is a very talented rebounder he was just kinda lazy in college. Not saying that couldn't continue to be the case, but I imagine playing players that can actually compete with him more often will inspire some motor. "
humanhighlightreel,"true. it was still an awful draft for Kahn, as he took back to back PGs at 5 and 6. Plus, a lot of people did think Curry was way better than Flynn (and there is no way Flynn ever would have been this good). but definitely Flynn could have been an NBA player. "
humanhighlightreel,You just completely ignored my argument and regurgitated the same comment you have made throughout this thread. Clearly you are not capable of thought or discussion.
humanhighlightreel,"Lou Will had 56% TS this year. That's above average efficiency

I agree its a stupid award though"
humanhighlightreel,"no way dude. The Dubs half court defense is stiffling, and it is impossible to score that efficiently in the half court anyway. "
humanhighlightreel,"So delay the rebuild 4 years as playoff bate, get worse picks, and let Melo retire without ever making an ECF with the Knicks? Sounds like a good plan. "
humanhighlightreel,I did it myself. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) is the end of season iteration. 
humanhighlightreel,"That's not a crazy stat. The Spurs have only lost 8 series in that time. In 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012 and 2013 a team from the east won. 

So basically all you said is that the Mavs in 2011 and the Lakers in 2009 and 2010 never played the Spurs, which isn't that surprising because they were all pretty high seeds. 

Not very crazy. "
humanhighlightreel,So like LeBron
humanhighlightreel,They would be going to 7 against the Dubs in this series. I still think they would lose and we would get Dubs-Cavs. 
humanhighlightreel,"Jah's FT shooting will be fine - everyone who knows him agrees on that. 

His defense will be above average. He was a lazy fuck at times in college, but he is huge and strong, and has log arms. He will never be DJ or AD, but he won't be a liability either. 

If he can average 20 and 10 his second year, he will be a rich man's boogie cousins. "
humanhighlightreel,Bulls fans.
humanhighlightreel,Kobe's TS% this year was 47.7% and his USG was 34.9%. That is absolutely chucker status. 
humanhighlightreel,"Probably Manu in 07-08. 20/5/5 on 61% true shooting with great defense. Absolute beast. 

84-85 McHale is up there, as /u/toast_365 said, though he was playing 34 minutes a game, and was probably not as good as Manu. 

James Harden in 11-12 is a valid choice as well. He had less usage than the typical 6MOY, cause he played in 3 superstar lineups a good amount, but he had an insane 66% true shooting %. He was probably the most talented 6MOY, if not the most impactful. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean I get what you were trying to do, it just seems like you've had a little bit too much coffee. "
humanhighlightreel,why? should he be higher or lower?
humanhighlightreel,that didn't make much sense. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;How can you compare this with someone that got killed. It must fucking suck for the guy that killed him and everyone can understand that. 

The point of the comparison is that this is a much less extreme version of that. It is much easier to forgive an accidental injury than manslaughter, though both certainly *deserve* forgiveness, so long as there was no maliciousness or reckless endangerment. 

&gt;Its not like Kelly should be devastated because it was an accident and Love will comeback. 

Isn't this the exact reason Love should forgive him? I am sure Kelly is not devastated, at least not that Love is acting like a little girl about it. I am sure prior to this though, he felt pretty horrible. 

&gt;Love xan still be pissed about it and if he aint ready to forgive yet he just aint. Humans are diffrent from each other.

Man absolutely Love can still be pissed. He can be pissed at the world, pissed at his luck, and pissed that Kelly is such an uncoordinated buffoon. But to not even hear out his apology is just childish and petty. If he wants to get on the phone and say ""Kelly, you are a fucking idiot"" that is fine, but he should acknowledge that is was an accident, that Kelly is remorseful and he should forgive him. Say ""Kelly, you are a fucking idiot, but I know you didn't mean to do this and I forgive you.""

Anyway, its not really a big deal. So Love is missing the playoffs. There are a lot worse things that could happen - and that is coming from a close friend of one of Love's teammates that wants to see him get a ring. I don't really care, and I am sure after this act, Kelly Olynyk doesn't either. It is truly surprising to me that modern America endorses such childish behavior as harboring a grudge for an accidental injury, but I guess that's just the world we live in. I am in the minority, but at least I am right."
humanhighlightreel,Yeah he was a Q 
humanhighlightreel,"1. There is a smaller talent pool to draw from for bigs than guards, so the ones that make the league are less coordinated on average. 

2. Guards spend their lives farther from the basket, and therefore spend more time shooting in general. 

3. Some argue that having bigger hands makes it harder to shoot (think about trying to shoot a tennis ball vs. a beachball into an appropriate rim for each)

4. Its just generally harder to be coordinated for taller people. Your limbs are longer, so a 10% deviation in form results in a bigger miss than it would for a shorter person. That is why there are no (or few) 7 footers in golf, hockey, soccer, etc. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"Its just the binomial formula, but for 7 choose 0. 7C0 = 1.

P = 1 x 1-0.159^(7-0) x 0.159^0

P = 0.841^7

P = ~30%"
humanhighlightreel,"Because while it decreases the EV of points per possession, it also decreases variance. If you are down by a significant margin, you want to maximize variance. If you are ahead, you want to minimize it. "
humanhighlightreel,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXw6znXPfy4
humanhighlightreel,The warriors were also not that good of a team in the first two of those seasons. 
humanhighlightreel,"nothing. people are just very resistant to change.

its unbelievable that we still refer to James Harden as playing a different position than all the other primary ball-handlers in the league. With LeBron its a little different, because there are enough possessions when Irving is healthy where he starts plays in the post or on the wing, but in the playoffs he has been a PG for the vast majority of the time. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, that's what I said. There are players who don't crack under pressure. Most don't once they have been in the league long enough. "
humanhighlightreel,"Conleys max will be like 29 mill too. Don't think he'll get that, but it's scary"
humanhighlightreel,"With both teams healthy, this would be a series for the ages. As it is, I doubt the Cavs get to game 6. Love makes a HUGE difference to this team, and I doubt Irving will be back to himself for the finals. "
humanhighlightreel,Both WS and VORP are dependent on minutes doe
humanhighlightreel,"no, they are not"
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;I imply the exact same thing experts imply when they say Lebron James can guard all 5 positions.

Right, which is exactly what I am saying he *can't* do. "
humanhighlightreel,"Maybe to the media. In 2002 and 2003 there wasn't a number 1 on the Lakers even. Shaq and Kobe had almost identical USG rates, with Shaq slightly higher in 2002 and Kobe in 2003. 

As I said, LeBron would have the ball more, but they would adamantly try to get outside of the box people like you and Skip try to put basketball players in. Who took more shots in any given game would be dependent on matchups, who was feeling it, and would also just evolve over the course of a season. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah but in summer league he showed he has a ton of other attributes he didn't need to use at Kentucky. He is a really good ball-handler for a big, and has nice form on his shot. "
humanhighlightreel,Nobody has even had workouts. Of course they aren't gonna limit themselves to two players. 
humanhighlightreel,"Delly is not worth anything, really. Good game last night, but he is a pretty bad NBA player on both ends. 

Offensively, he can shoot, but so can Seth fuckin Curry and he doesn't have a job. He is the worst player in the league inside the arc, where he shoots 31%, and he is a pretty uninspiring distributor throwing 8.8 apples per 100 passes, which is outside the top 50 for PGs. You aren't paying him serious cash when his only value on that end comes from being teammates with LeBron and knocking down 3's. 

Defensively, his energy is infectious and makes him a fan favorite. Sadly, that's all it is: energy. His opponents torch him, shooting a ridiculous 80% at the rim when guarded by him and 8% better than their normal FG% overall. 

At the end of the day, Outback Jesus is lovable, but he is a borderline NBA player. Anything over 2 or 3 million a year for him would be a massive overpay. They could get nearly the same value for the minimum from a guy like Curry. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's not true. A player as good as AD would have little to no risk taking a shorter term deal, and with the cap set to explode it would probably be financially beneficial (or at least be sacrificing a lot less career earnings than in other years). However, I don't think he is desperate enough to get out of NOLA to even consider it. "
humanhighlightreel,JJ Barea. English is not his first language. 
humanhighlightreel,"....no, that is not a valid comparison. "
humanhighlightreel,"no, LeBron is hurt. "
humanhighlightreel,You guys just think that because you are an overly defensive fan-base.

humanhighlightreel,"No, he's really not. He shoots way too much, is inefficient and has pretty poor court vision. He is also an average defender. "
humanhighlightreel,absolutely. wish he would come in as head coach. he is way better than Casey

humanhighlightreel,Or any Plumlee.

humanhighlightreel,So far I have gone back to 1980 and nobody has done it. 
humanhighlightreel,"How can he not shoot in the playoffs?

EDIT: I thought this guy was saying in general, not just in these playoffs. "
humanhighlightreel,"That is just way overrating the leverage. There is still Mudiay, or the Sixers could draft Okafor and trade him for someone who will probably be better than Russell. I bet they could get like Bradley Beal for him. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Every one is saying the Clippers

Welcome to /r/nba, where only the last 3 days matter. "
humanhighlightreel,"Read the initial posts again. I didn't say that either makes the other obsolete as a player. I said generally, that people on here tend to foolishly value redundancy in general - referring not specifically to AD and DJ, but to the justification of putting the league's two best shot blockers together. 

Also, context matters. Given that I mentioned **diminishing** returns (not zero returns) on defense, and the fact that people use the term redundant in this context all the time in basketball, it is pretty clear I was not saying either's shot-blocking skill was completely useless when paired together. 

You absolutely misinterpreted. "
humanhighlightreel,I love Detlef. I am going to wear my Detlef jersey tomorrow in his honor.
humanhighlightreel,"Dude went off for 7 points a reb and an assist in 6 minutes on 100/100/100 shooting doe!

His per 36 minutes stats were 42, 6 and 6 on 117% true shooting. Joe Harris is GOAT."
humanhighlightreel,"You never know with Hinkie. Personally, after the defensive potential (slash not even potential because he is one of the few rookies I have ever seen who was legitimately helpful on that end) Noel displayed this season, it would be foolish to prioritize an unknown over him. He could be a perennial DPOY candidate starting in two years.

Frankly, for all his injury and attitude concerns, Embiid is still probably the best prospect of the 4. He isn't as NBA ready, but has the offensive potential of Okafor, and the defensive potential of Towns - there are legitimate concerns about both those guys on their weak ends. 

Given that, I don't think you can put anyone on the block. So you have 3 options:

1. Draft Russell. Pros: he is a stud, and an amazing fit for a team in need of shooting. Cons: he is not the highest valued player available (doesn't mean he isn't the best). 

2. Trade down to 3, draft Russell. Pros: teams will be willing to pay a lot for the top pick and the chance at a franchise-changing big. You might be able to get Russell and a protected pick from one of the other lottery teams. Cons: Might not get the right deal.

3. Draft Okafor or Towns, let the three battle it out. Trade the least promising at season's end. Pros: decrease risk of giving up a stud. Cons: decrease reward by trading devalued asset. "
humanhighlightreel,There aren't many people as smart as me. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean people always equate athleticism and ceiling, which makes sense to an extent, but is just kinda dumb. talking about ceilings without any kind of probability considerations is a pointless tasks. all of our ceilings are the same because we might find MJ's old shoes hanging on an electrical line.

humanhighlightreel,probably? dude
humanhighlightreel,"The point is the team is much better with him on the ball, as he is one of the best PGs in the league. That is pretty much impossible to refute considering how things went this year. 

I agree that the burden he took on was too tiring, which is why they need a *secondary* ballhandler who can relieve him of 10-15 possessions a game on the ball and give the Rockets another look when teams are successfully shutting him down. "
humanhighlightreel,"I would say Pop is more Tim Burton. Man of few words, loyal to his cast, great at getting the most of people with unique/specialized skill sets. "
humanhighlightreel,no clue. Not sure why that would be unlikely either way thoug. 
humanhighlightreel,Yes he counts in my book.
humanhighlightreel,maybe its an IP address thing for foreign viewers. My mistake. 
humanhighlightreel,I don't like the fit. Love is a much better shooter and passer. Aldridge would get in LeBron's way at times and use too many possessions. 
humanhighlightreel,Rookie contract + 5 year extension. The only way to maximize guaranteed money is to stay for 9 years.
humanhighlightreel,"....no. I know a lot more about basketball than you do, I assure you of that. 

which college C was better off the bounce than Jah? his ball-handling is wildly under-appreciated"
humanhighlightreel,Yeah. He is probably a 9/10 that's pretty good. Russ is the most athletic guard since Jordan. 
humanhighlightreel,"ok, but faster doesn't necessarily mean better, so that doesn't matter. "
humanhighlightreel,Bird got all defense because he could rebound and picked up steals in the post a lot. He was a bad perimeter defender.

humanhighlightreel,"I think they would do that. Melo is overpaid, too old for a rebuilding team and has questionable knees. Blake is a top 5 NBA asset. I think they would do that for sure. 

Only team that doesn't do this is the Clips"
humanhighlightreel,"Dude Chauncey shot 39% in the playoffs. He was a very good player, but Wallace was one of the best defensive Cs in history. He won 4 fucking DPOYs. Chauncey hit a lot of big shots, and sure he was a steadying force in the locker room, but to say he was as good as Ben at that stage is just downright incorrect. A lot of PGs could have stepped in and they still would have won - that is not the case for Ben. There is no way that Sheed could have covered for Ben either that is retarded, he wasn't even close as a rim protector. "
humanhighlightreel,Rodman was arguably the best or second best player on the 89 Pistons as well. 
humanhighlightreel,....Steph Curry?
humanhighlightreel,"Dude, his waste is at other guys' heads. And he is like 5 feet from the ball when he grabs it. "
humanhighlightreel,"Except I am very obviously not doing that. I am trying to have a rational discussion about a basketball player's weaknesses (we all have them). People always talk about ""LeBron-haters"".... I am far from one.... but the ""LeBron-worshippers"" are just overly defensive. I am calling the dude the best player in the NBA but still get heat for analyzing his problems. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"He was pretty tall for a PG, and he was also insanely strong. High BBall IQ helps too. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah but when he touches the ball you can just foul him and send him to the line. I get that you have less options with respects to who can pick up the foul, but its a pretty small downside. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;few decimal points of a better passer than DJ is

What does that even mean? How can you be a few decimal points better at passing than someone?"
humanhighlightreel,the fact that usually you mofuckas are the homeriest bunch on this sub
humanhighlightreel,It doesn't better prove my point though. 
humanhighlightreel,Nah its not very good. With his strength if he had a reliable post up game it would be devastating. 
humanhighlightreel,"He was probably the league' most impactful defender this year, per minute. Either him or Gobert. "
humanhighlightreel,what are you talking about? he takes some dumb shots but he is wet as fuck 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Plus, it's not like he is condemned to play in a single city his whole career.

No, just for 9 years. 

I don't understand why people think these guys should be greatful they are being offered millions of dollars to play basketball. it is their market value, not a gift. "
humanhighlightreel,that could be said about literally any team of any major professional sport. 
humanhighlightreel,But he's a prep-to-pro rookie. He could get definitely there.

humanhighlightreel,"I understand that, but his inability to forgive is really only hurting himself. Especially for something that wasn't even malicious! Its pretty unbelievable. I know a dude who accidentally killed a guy on a dump tackle in a rugby game. The guy who he killed's parents immediately expressed their support for the guy who did it because they knew it was just sports and accidents happen in sports. And their son died, for god's sake!

Oh, and that guy who did the dump tackle - [this is him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Cizikas). You wonder where he would be right now were it not for those understanding parents. 

Can't believe anyone is even down-voting this shit. Its truly unbelievable. To err is human. To forgive, divine. To forgive an accidental sports injury, common sense. There are much worse things that can happen to a person than missing the NBA playoffs (not to trivialize that - I realize Love has worked his whole life for it)."
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;What? Aldridge is allowing 45.1% at the rim this year. Ahead of guys like Howard, Noel, Whiteside.

I meant to say ""its all *he* does on offense. Aldridge is a fine defender, certainly above average. That number is misleading in comparison to those guys because he only contests 28% of shots at the rim (compared to 59% for Whiteside), but he is a pretty good defender all over the court. 

&gt;Yes, this is true in the playoffs this year but if you ever watched Aldridge before that you would know who's one of the most efficient big men at moving the ball around.

This is just categorically untrue. 

First, my comment is that he never passes, not that he can't, and that is true. He passes the ball 38 times per game, compared to 57 for Blake, 48 for Pau (who has the ball way less than him), 47 for K-Love (who has the ball way less than him), 43 for Duncan, Millsap and West, 42 for Ibaka. He has the ball as much as any forward in the league, and ranks 16th overall in passes per game. That is just awful. 

Your comment was actually not about volume of passes though, you cited his efficiency. Here, he grades out even worse. For every 100 passes Aldridge throws, he only generates 4.5 assists, 35th in the league among PFs. Compare that to 9.4 for Griffin, 7.5 for West, 6.9 for Duncan, 6.2 for AD, 5.6 for Pau, yada yada yada. You get the picture. He never passes, and when he does its not good, which is insane given how often he is double teamed."
humanhighlightreel,"oh, yeah, that is what I was referencing. "
humanhighlightreel,complaining about timeouts is so 2004
humanhighlightreel,Hope the T-Wolves get it.

humanhighlightreel,"Opposite of aggressive help on the pick and roll - I meant weakside help (which admittedly is not what I said; didn't really articulate my thought well, my bad). 

Thibs was known for packing the paint with weak side players more than usual, something all other teams have followed suit on. That is one of the main developments that has made ball movement so important. "
humanhighlightreel,"Agree to disagree. Its very hard to go on runs when every one of your possessions is half court (easy to get back after FT, made or missed) and its unlikely that your opponent will string many empty possessions together in a row. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean he was definitely a beast. He was a top 3-5 player in the league for a solid 5 years (probably peaked at 2, even) and is top 20 now. But you have 6 bigs who are top 11 players ever in Wilt, Russell, Hakeem, Shaq, Duncan and Kareem (to go along with Jordan, Magic, Bird, Kobe and LeBron). D12 would be lucky to be a top 50 player ever, all things considered, and is *certainly* not top 25. "

Vince used to be considered an amazing talent and great player, but with a shitty, me-first attitude and no desire on defense. The way he reinvented himself as a valuable role player and hard-nosed defender later in his career, unlike TMAC, AI, Stackhouse and all the other early 00s gunners (except Kobe), has done nothing but help his reputation. "
humanhighlightreel,"depends what you are looking for. 

for a quick look up of how good a guys numbers are: PER and WS

for an indication of their actual value on the court, that is based on a lot of assumptions and therefore not very reliable: RPM and BPM

for defense specific stats: nylon calculus' rim protection stats, NBA.com's opponent FG% player tracking stats

for offense specific stats: ppg, TS% in combination with one another. [NBA Passer Rating](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/) is a stat I invented, but I think its the best out there for passing ability. 

Really though, context is everything in basketball. You need to get an understanding of the game first, then stats can be useful in backing up your arguments."

humanhighlightreel,"I think you can make the argument for either. CP3 is and was a much more rounded player, but he was never even close to the scorer Curry is. "
humanhighlightreel,"Its not a horrible comparison, and you basically just changed your argument to ""using natural coordination as a comparison is stupid because it can be taught/learned"" to ""using it is stupid *in this instance* because the two players are close.""

That is fine. Agree to disagree on that. Jah is much more coordinated than his FT% suggests - that is mental and something he has to work on - but I understand your skepticism that he is that much more coordinated than Towns. As someone who has watched pretty much every game both has played this year, I think the difference is massive, and very important. "

Those teams floundered because they were the 6th and 7th best teams in the NBA by SRS - they weren't Championship contenders to begin with. You just cherry picked them because they kind of support your argument. "
humanhighlightreel,"His defense isn't that good anymore. Ever since he has taken on a 1b role offensively his defense has regressed (he is a negative defender by both RPM and BPM, and opponents shoot better than their avgs everwhere on the floor against him). It is still better than Lillards probably (who made strides, but still gets hidden on weaker offensive players often), and is still great for stretches, but the gap isn't big enough to make up for the offensive one.

humanhighlightreel,so what is it? you can't just post something like this without your method lol
humanhighlightreel,"Right, but he would have to take a qualifying offer and risk injury. I am just saying the system is built to provide players with little choice. It makes the league better, so I get it, but I also understand why a player wouldn't want to have to choose between security and quality of life over a 9 year period. "
humanhighlightreel,"I sense your sarcasm, but this is a pretty simple statistic. Doesn't take a huge leap of faith to buy it. "
humanhighlightreel,"Plus GP, who could probably crack the top 30. "
humanhighlightreel,care to elaborate at all?
humanhighlightreel,I think Minny will end up taking Jah. 
humanhighlightreel,"A STEP BACK JUMPER FROM CHEF CURRY THAT IS 

GOTEEEEEEEEEEM"
humanhighlightreel,"It wasn't a direct comparison, as in MKG is his *closest* NBA comp, but there is definitely overlap in their play styles to the point where you might not want them sharing the court. They are both incredibly strong wings who are limited in half court offense. Sure, Johnson's jumper isn't broke as fuck, but it's not good and he has a tough time creating looks. The defence would be nice, but the offense would just be anemic with these two. "
humanhighlightreel,"Not only that, but Ernst &amp; Young audits the lottery. Do people really think the NBA could pay them enough - and keep in mind EY's 2014 revenues were more than the collective value of the entire league - to risk their reputation? 

Its primarily an audit firm, reputation is pretty important. "
humanhighlightreel,That distinction absolutely means something. Wallace was so much more valuable than chauncey
humanhighlightreel,"nah I think he's about properly rated. he was never in the elite tier of players who could make a team competitive by himself, but he was a top 10 player for ages and an absolute killer in the clutch. He's a top 50 all time, but certainly below Duncan, LeBron, Kobe, Dirk, Garnett and Shaq in terms of 00-10 players. You could convince me he is up there with Nash, purely based on how long he was great for. "
humanhighlightreel,"No. LeBron was a dick to Rio and killed his confidence continually. He is certainly a good teammate, but he isn't some god-send. 

Timmy D has anchored a culture of camaraderie his entire career. He would get my vote."
humanhighlightreel,Dude Garnett was an animal in 04 and 05 and everyone knew it. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Nah I disagree. He shot 40% from the field, that's not efficient. He shot 34% on 3s while almost taking 6 a game. That's not efficient. He was good at drawing Fts so that is making his TS% higher. He won us games but probably lost us more, especially with his awful defense.

The fuck are you talking about? 56% TS is efficient. I don't think you understand efficiency. 

&gt;yea and they were probably playing with a stacked team or on a team with a superstar. ISO plays isn't gonna get you far when you let 6MOTY players take em.

Right, a guy like Lou is someone you want on a contender. He is a luxury, not a foundation player. That's why I want him gone. 

&gt;Also the guy isn't a good passer either. I put most of the blame on Lou Williams for us finishing bottom 10 in assists. This guy is ball-stopper. This was the lowest assist average he's had since his 2nd year but also the most points in a season and points per game.

I mean, that was our offense. But obviously he is not a willing passer. 

&gt;We let him become our 3rd best player and that's not a good thing for a team that wants to go far in the playoffs. He should have just been a guy that plays with the 2nd unit, not a guy that closes games.

Completely agree"
humanhighlightreel,"Ah, forgot about internal victories. "
humanhighlightreel,"Oladipo and, to risk being an /r/nba cliche, its not even fucking close. "
humanhighlightreel,"The front office in LA has made some mistakes, but to say there is no reason they should be in the bottom 5 isn't fair. Since 2010 they have been building the team for the short run around aging players. It had to end sometime. Every team has to rebuild eventually. 

And to be honest, other than D'Antoni over Phil, the Lakers FO hasn't really done anything aggregious. They have picked up good, low value assets (Clarkson, Ed Davis) and I believe they got a stud in Randle. They still have their top pick this year, and cap space going forward.

If you think Nash, Kobe, Pau and Dwight was a reflection of poor front office work, you are an idiot, because the reaction at the time was more ""HOW THE FUCK DID THEY PULL THIS OFF BUSS IS A WIZARD"" than ""this isn't gonna work"". "
humanhighlightreel,"Except I know him personally, as well as the people he works with, and everyone is pretty confident that it was mental this year and he will sort it out. 

I am very confident; don't really care if others are."

humanhighlightreel,"Conley - no chance. Its Gasol

Teague - no chance. Its Horford (or *maybe* Millsap, but really its Horford)

Wall - obviously

Rose - Butler right now is much more consistent"
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, Beal pretty much is just a 3 point shooter at this point. This is not salt (I know he torched us), and I think he will get a lot better, but he is only really an efficient player when he is bombing from deep right now. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yup. I haven't been there much because I don't like distractions when I am watching, but my few experiences have made me glad I stay away. "
humanhighlightreel,that may or may not be true. i guess we will never know. 
humanhighlightreel,"Kobe might miss a lot, but he is still smoother at getting a shot over anyone with his back 2 the basket game. I'll give Harden the step back, but a lot of the offense he creates other than those is getting to the line, which doesn't really qualify as smooth shot creation. "
humanhighlightreel,I thought Prigs was great in the Clips series.

humanhighlightreel,Poop
humanhighlightreel,Best players by what metric? How are you evaluating these players if not by value to a team?
humanhighlightreel,"not actually 30 for 30, but great movie"
humanhighlightreel,"Except 3 point shooting teams have done exceptionally well in the playoffs every year. 

I am not denying the game has changed, but that is because of rule changes and players becoming better at shooting. "
humanhighlightreel,"Me saying he wasn't DeAndre wasn't to say he wasn't as skilled; it was to say physically he is not as impressive. He is really quick and bouncy for his size, but he isn't nearly as beastly - he has 4 inches less on his standing reach and he isn't as strong. 

Regardless, DeAndre isn't even that good. WCS would have to become the best defensive player in the league to ever be a star because he is so offensively inept, like DJ. "
humanhighlightreel,"Thanks, Charles. Shooting jumpers not something that has ever prevented a team from winning a ship. If you have the personnel, it is a good thing. 

You aren't even right, by the way. The Dubs are no more of a jump shooting team than any other. They were 7th in the league in 3 point attempt rate this year, behind the Rockets (1), Cavs (2), Clippers (3) and Hawks (4). That's right, of the 7 remaining teams only the Grizz and Wizards took threes on fewer of their possessions. 

Also, the 2012 Thunder were 9th. 

The Dubs are a balanced team, and a fucking good one. They were the best team in the league by a huge margin this year, and they are the rightful favorites. No team as strong as them by SRS has ever *not* won the ship (except the 72 Bucks who lost to a team with an even *better* SRS)."
humanhighlightreel,"Right, but LeBron's positioning is above the break, where a PG operates, for the vast majority of games right now. 

You are also exaggerating how often Boogie controlled the rock this year. "
humanhighlightreel,that wasn't in bold. 
humanhighlightreel,Still the best jersey by far. 
humanhighlightreel,"No, LeBron is. He is more of PG, taller and has a better jumper than Tyreke. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;what else floats in water?

Bread! Apples! Very small rocks!

But for real - obviously no pick is a sure thing and you can get talent later on, but your chances of getting a superstar at No. 1 are really high, top 5 are OK, and everything below that is pretty much a crap shoot. Sure, scouting matters for those picks, but luck matters a lot more. So landing the top pick is huge, and missing on it is understandably upsetting.

Look at the top picks this millennium: Sure, you have Bennett, Oden (injuries), Bargs, and Kwame, but you also have the best player in the league (Bron), 5 more top ~15 players (Griffin, Irving, Wall, Davis, Howard, Rose) plus Yao Ming and Kenyon Martin (K-Mart wasn't great, but that draft sucked. You are literally batting over 50% on super-duper-stars. 
"
humanhighlightreel,not every rugby player is insane. 
humanhighlightreel,"I actually agree with that, but if he can and chose not to, he might as well not be able to. 

Maybe one-dimensional isn't the perfect word, but if there is a better way to say ""he only really provides *significant* value in one way on offense"", then let me know. "
humanhighlightreel,"Harden-type? Sure. But not quite on his level. I don't think he would have ever been a serious MVP candidate, but he definitely could have been a perennial All-Star. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, certain awards carry a lot more weight than others in the NHL. I don't think it devalues the main ones at all - the Hart is still a huge deal. 

And it makes for a fun night, while recognizing more talent. 

I also just think separating DPOY into perimeter and interior is just a no brainer. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, I can go a lot deeper, its just this argument doesn't really need to be made to people who know anything about basketball and the NBA. Figured I wouldn't waste my time. "
humanhighlightreel,technicality. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Actually I was referring to the whole season, not the playoffs. Billups has a better WS. It's funny how you say they're basically tied in WS (when they're not as Wallace has 10.2 and Billups as 11.3) and then say Wallace crushes Billups in BPM (when that's not true either - Wallace has 5.1 and Billups 3.4) to fit your narrative. Good job looking at the numbers objectively.

I was referring to the playoffs where they *were* basically tied in WS (3.7 vs. 3.6) and Wallace did crush him in BPM (5.1 vs 3.6). And what's the biggest flaw with WS? It gives players defensive WS based on their individual DRTG, which is influenced by their *lineups* success and as much as their own (see: Boozer, Carlos). Regardless, I am not going to sit here and tell you that there is a way to settle this argument with advanced stats because beyond those shitty box score aggregators we just don't have any for that era. 

&gt;Boy that is just not true. In fact, it's laughable. Without Billups, they would have struggled to score against Milwaukee and I certainly saw the Nets knocking them out. So clearly, you're not looking at this objectively. 

Again, I am not suggesting that without Billups they could have got there. Their backup was Lindsey Hunter for god's sake. I am saying that there are way more players that you could replace Billups with than Walllace that still would have had them in contention including: Kidd, Nash, Iverson, Davis, Cassell and Bibby at the very least. There is one such player at C and that is Shaq. Chauncey wasn't even an All Star; Wallace was a fucking starter. "
humanhighlightreel,German's don't have tears. 
humanhighlightreel,"Shaq actually averaged 25 and 10 on 59% shooting against Ben in 13 games. The Pistons as a team were able to slow him down in the 2004 Playoffs, and Ben was a big part of that, but Ben himself absolutely did not make Shaq appear normal. "
humanhighlightreel,What an asshole. Those people probably just wanted to see a fight that night. 
humanhighlightreel,"Well, I wouldn't go that far. 

You have to be tough to be a good forward. 

And you can absolutely get injured, though the severity of injuries is much less than, say, football. "
humanhighlightreel,McGee is pretty easy to understand. 
humanhighlightreel,And the leafers have 13 cups. 
humanhighlightreel,"no, it was not"
humanhighlightreel,"yes, that is why it is rare. "
humanhighlightreel,"I think you take Okafor. He is a perfect fit with Ibaka, is the best player in the draft right now by far, and gives you an insurance policy (that Russ might want to play with) if KD bolts. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, just yes. "
humanhighlightreel,Not at all. You think the difference between DeAndre Jordan and Dirk comes down to work ethic? Child please. 
humanhighlightreel,Yeah true I was just considering his wins. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yes it does, it means you are a dual citizen. "
humanhighlightreel,"They can't beat the Warriors, but interesting post nonetheless!"
humanhighlightreel,"What is *really* a HOF player? Based on the standards set by the league, then yes, he is more than qualified. If you are saying the HOF should be more selective, that is a different conversation (I actually agree with you if that is the case). 

But even if the HOF became 10-15% more selective, Zo would still have a good chance. He was one of the best 2-way players in the league for a long time, and his MIA teams were better than you think (61 wins and ECF loss to Bulls in 97). You have to give a little bit of consideration (with respects to longevity) for injuries - same reason Grant Hill is 100% deserving. "
humanhighlightreel,&gt;current history
humanhighlightreel,"I said that elsewhere in the thread. The fans is absolutely also a factor. 

I have no idea why all you ATL fans are getting insulted haha"
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, it 27 points on 49% true shooting is not *that* impressive. There are a lot of guys in the league who can do that. And 8 assists while tossing 4.5 possessions away is also not that impressive. He has been putting up big stats, but he has also had the ball basically all post-season. 

Now, the fact that he is doing it with terrible spacing makes it better, and his rebounding and defense have been great, but he has by no means been an offensive machine. "
humanhighlightreel,"**Ben McLemore** or Terrence Ross

Matt Bonner or **Channing Frye**

**Harrison Barnes** or Otto Porter

**John Stockton** or Jason Kidd"
humanhighlightreel,"*this* playoffs. I thought he meant in general. Yeah, he is in a huge slump right now. "
humanhighlightreel,That's not true. I think the 10th one where Iggy timed his through the legs cross was a BRILLIANT defensive play. Rest of them were pretty bad. 
humanhighlightreel,"Shooting over 50% from the line in an NBA game is really, really hard. Way harder than it sounds. You're exhausted, getting beat up by other giants, and in front of 20,000 people. 

Most NBA players in the 6'0""-6'8"" range are very good at this skill, usually hitting 3 out of 4 shots, or better. There is a reason for this: there are so many of them on the planet, that the only ones good enough to add value to an NBA team are exceptionally coordinated human beings. 

7 footers tend to shoot much worse from the foul line. This is because, there is so much demand for the tallest athletes on earth in the league, and so little supply of these guys. As a result, the level of coordination among these players is significantly lower. Furthermore, many would argue it is *easier* to be coordinated at a smaller size because (a) your limbs are shorter - a 5% mistake in your stroke would represent a smaller deviation, in inches, from your target and (b) your hands are larger. 

Overall, there are real reasons why taller NBA players struggle at the line. If you don't think they practice from there, you are an idiot. Fortunately they make up for it in other ways, so it is valuable to have them on the court. 

Poor FT shooters are already penalized a shit load over the course of a game. These dumb ass rules don't make them work harder at it, it just takes a great game and puts way too much emphasis on a single weakness. 

Its like if they made every teams little white PG guard the opponents best player every game - its legislating the exploitation of a single weakness in a game that is about a team covering for each others. 

"
humanhighlightreel,Ok. 
humanhighlightreel,No. Dude was a straight up murderer.
humanhighlightreel,because people are dumb. 
humanhighlightreel,Jamario Moon. Only player in history whose best highlight is a [rebound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XT8xplDccE)
humanhighlightreel,"No, its like someone accidentally crashes into your new car, and calls to apologize. Common decency would mean accepting that apology. "
humanhighlightreel,"6+15+5+10=36

36/4=9.0 

James Harden averages 10.2 FTs per game. So he is taking 1 less FTA per game in a 4 games sample. That is not statistically significant. 

Also worth noting his FGA are down from 18.1 to 16.0, so he is actually getting to the line on 21.5% of his scoring attempts in the series (1 FTA = 0.44 attempts) vs. 19.9% in the regular season. "
humanhighlightreel,Yes. It was arguably the best part of his game until Smith got to Detroit and fucked up all the spacing. His assist #s went way up after he left too. 
humanhighlightreel,Spo
humanhighlightreel,"That's (a) because it took till near the end of the season for Love to be effectively integrated and (b) BPM relies a lot on box score stats, and Love's are obviously down. His RPM was right in line with Kyrie's, btw. 

Even with his early season struggles, Love's effect on the team was massive. The Irving/Smith/James/Love/Mozgod lineup was +20.7 points per 100 possessions for the year. The Irving/Smith/James/Thompson/Mozgod lineup was -8.0. The spacing he provides for that team is simply massive, and their ball movement is a lot better when he is on the court as well. If you couldn't see the effect he had on this team, you haven't been watching close enough in recent months. "
humanhighlightreel,"I would say the answer is ""no"", but its not ""lol, no"".

LeBron is still a dominant scorer, he is just dealing with spacing issues and occasionally making poor decisions. And he is still probably the best passer of the three. That said he is *absolutely* in decline, and he has not shown enough intuition to adjust his game to his (very) slowly fading athleticism. He should be posting more, and making quicker decisions, rather than continually sizing up the defense for step backs. The way he is playing is counter-intuitive, but you definitely have to chock some of that up to lineup. "
humanhighlightreel,It would be very impressive
humanhighlightreel,"True, but he certainly has the tools to be a rangy defender. Very few rookie bigs are effective away from the basket. "
humanhighlightreel,why would you want a molester on your team?
humanhighlightreel,That may or may not be true. All I am saying is that he very clearly knew Nene was looking away when he dished. You claimed the contrary. 
humanhighlightreel,"Dude, you are crazy. It may have been an easier path that normal, but nobody really challenged them all year. "
humanhighlightreel,"No, you just said you imply that he can guard 1-5 the way LeBron can. That is not the case. LeBron has actually *guarded* every position in his career. Cauley-Stein will never start possessions on a 1 or 2 in his NBA career. "
humanhighlightreel,"Can he? Absolutely. He was third in voting last year and is only getting better.

Will he? I wouldn't bet on it at even odds, but after Davis, Durant, James and Curry he and Harden are probably tied for the next best chance at getting one in the next decade. "
humanhighlightreel,"Right, which is why it would stop intentional fouling. "
humanhighlightreel,"Gasol for sure. Aldridge is not a very good passer, and the Spurs prize ball movement. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's not true. I just ran the numbers: 

Kyrie lost his dribble 61 times in 451.4 minutes of possession this season, an average of once every 7.4 minutes he had the ball. 

Steph lost his dribble 58 times in 402.9 minutes of possession this season, an average of once every 6.9 minutes he had the ball. 

Assuming Kyrie has more flair (i.e. attempts riskier plays with his dribble) then he also must have significantly more control. "
humanhighlightreel,"They need a combo guard who can hit the three off ball, but also act as a secondary ball-handler to relieve some of Harden's burden. I think CJ Watson makes a lot of sense as a cheaper option. Maybe bring Aaron Brooks back for one last tour of duty. Both are FAs. If they wanted to go more expensive, Cory Joseph could be great as a more long term option, but Spurs could obviously match anything they offer as he is an RFA."
humanhighlightreel,He has in the playoffs too
humanhighlightreel,Yeah but an entire missed year of development and lost muscle memory can set you back for a while
humanhighlightreel,Probably John Wall or Al Horford this season.
humanhighlightreel,"Paul Pierce

He called game. "
humanhighlightreel,"All is fair in Love and Basketball (no homo) (also, great fucking movie). "
humanhighlightreel,"Stackhouse's combination of usage and inefficiency was pretty mind boggling. When you are shooting a true 52%, and you have a usage rate over 35 (2001 season) it looks pretty bad. 

However, it looks a little better when you consider how little offensive talent was on that team. He played a much more reasonable game before Grant Hill went to Orlando, but once Hill left he tried to be Iverson. And he just wasn't. "
humanhighlightreel,i don't even know how that's an insult. honey nut cheerios are delicious.
humanhighlightreel,"It will never happen. People talked (joked) about it with Griner, who was the most physically dominant woman in memory, but in reality she would be the worst player on a men's D3 team.

Adam Silver is just saying that cause it sounds nice. "

humanhighlightreel,"No, this just isn't funny. At all. "
humanhighlightreel,"Probably started by Spears, who is an idiot. "
humanhighlightreel,Tell me before I open it: is he wearing a suit? I don't think I can subject my eyes to the work of TMac's tailor anymore. 
humanhighlightreel,"Chicago because I hate Chicago sports fans in general, and Bulls fans on /r/nba are the most insufferable homers. "
humanhighlightreel,"I don't think they would win the series. Probably Rockets in 5 or 6. 

I think an 11-12 point lead would make me say 50/50. "
humanhighlightreel,I took Dubs in 4 at +800 and Cavs in 7 at +750; 150 and 50. What did you get Dubs in 5 at? Odds were terrible for me. 
humanhighlightreel,"That happens pretty infrequently. Wouldn't make a big difference in the stats. If it did his TOV% would be attrocious, and its pretty solid at &lt;15%"
humanhighlightreel,Him and Melo would be an awful fit at the forward spots. 
humanhighlightreel,you would not classify LeBron or KD as bigs 
humanhighlightreel,And this team is the first one of all Finals rookies to be better than the 91 Bulls

humanhighlightreel,"He is not as good a scorer as prime Amar'e, but I definitely agree that he is the better overall player - the passing more than makes up for that gap. "
humanhighlightreel,"Your selection bias. Most players who leave teams (voluntarily) sign with a better one, so naturally most players who get hate are going to be making that transition. "
humanhighlightreel,DJ's form is actually pretty good. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Melo is probably the greatest offensive talent the NBA presently 

I can't stand when people say this. Melo has at no point in his NBA career been better offensively than LeBron. Melo might look like a better scorer because he makes tougher shots and has a smoother game, but LeBron has always been more capable of scoring more points, more efficiently than Melo if he wanted. Oh, and he is also basically a PG at the same time. 

Also, K fucking D? "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah cause he missed 4 in a row in game 1 lol
humanhighlightreel,Well done not saying chinks
humanhighlightreel,I wouldn't trade Blake for any asset in the league except for Davis or Durant
humanhighlightreel,the fuck are you smoking
humanhighlightreel,"Atlanta scored 17 more points over 6 games. They probably should have lost in 7, but they should have lost. 

Or does he mean if Wall was 100% healthy?"
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, positions are effectively dead in the NBA. LeBron has the ball the most on the Cavs and the offense is run through him. He plays above the break most of the time to start possessions (in the playoffs, at least). If anyone on the team is a PG, its him. All season he had the ball more than any non-PG in the league, by a lot, and in the playoffs his TOP has been higher than everyone except John Wall. 

"
humanhighlightreel,"We should hire Mon.... wait, we didn't fire Casey? WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUU............"
humanhighlightreel,you got issues man
humanhighlightreel,"At first I thought you were trying to say it was out best chance to see neither in the Finals and I was like, ""da fuq?"" But yeah Cavs and Lakers were probably the two best teams in the NBA in 08-09 regular season. Shame the Cavs couldn't get to the show. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;If he proves himself over the 4 year rookie deal, he could probably go anywhere he chooses for max money (that they could offer) and he'd be set for life, while building his brand in a bigger market or chasing a championship elsewhere.

Yeah but he would have to take a qualifying offer, which is something nobody ever does because of injury risk. 

&gt;Right, but the lack of security could mean a bigger paycheck in endorsements/building his brand..

But why not try and get this right off the bat. 

"
humanhighlightreel,MCW is terrible
humanhighlightreel,"Dame Lillard for sure. He is the better player now and much younger. Plus, Conley is up for a $29MM per year contract in 2016. Doubt he will get the max, but he is going to be overpaid by someone. "
humanhighlightreel,the point is using playoff stats is not a good way to judge these guys due to sample size
humanhighlightreel,Yes. Saying someone can come outside the paint on defense has a much different implication than saying they can guard 1-5
humanhighlightreel,it would be even more ridiculous. 
humanhighlightreel,I get it. Like a roller coaster. 
humanhighlightreel,"That stat is really not very useful. Its a pretty weak metric, in a pretty small sample size. Only Marc Gasol is a top 10 player, and Aldridge is top 20. Lopez and Hibbert are both unreliable (for different reasons) and pretty incomplete players. "
humanhighlightreel,Has a lot to do with MEM's amazing defense. Also has a lot to do with missing open looks. Don't think the Grizz will escape any more games without putting up at least 90.
humanhighlightreel,"Lawson is not overly ball-dominant. He held the ball for ~20% of his court time, which was around average for point guards, and that was on a team with no obvious secondary ball-handler. He is definitely an on-ball player, but he plays smart and moves it quickly. He also happens to have the most [effective passes in the league](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2xa5oh/final_draft_nba_passer_rating/)

What he will need to do is improve his catch and shoot to be more effective off the ball. He shot 35% on those shots this year, a number you would like to see increase. I would expect it won't be a problem for him with more repetition, as he has great form on those jump shots. 

Defensively it will be a mess for sure, but the Mavs will surely look for a strong defending guard in FA as well to stagger with those guys. 
"
humanhighlightreel,no freaking idea.  
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Everyone has seen the underdeveloped players enter the league and everyone hyped them the fuck up, and they just became nothing great, or just straight average.

Right, but he is already pretty good. I am talking about his path to greatness. Again, I said there are no guarantees in this league, but he has done nothing that wasn't encouraging since the initial hype. 

&gt;You can say the same for almost every player in the NBA.

Except he has a great midrange game and shot 35% from 3 this year. And I followed that if with saying he can be great without a jumper. 

&gt;Again, you can say this about every single lanky player in the league, and every lanky player that has ever been in the league. How unstoppable would Bol be if he was built like Shaq? How unstoppable would Caboclo be if he was built like Lebron?

Every 20 year old in NBA history has put on more muscle. Your examples are retarded. 
"
humanhighlightreel,for other people maybe. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;How do you explain the amount of European centres who CAN shoot free throws?

Population of Europe is over twice the population of America. Additionally, there are countries in Europe (Former Yugoslavia) where the average height is around 6'3"". There is simply a much larger sample of 7 footers to draw from, so the ones that make the NBA are generally more coordinated. 

However, there are still a ton of European bigs that can't shoot FTs. That phenomenon is really exaggerated. Guys like Andries Biedrins, DeSanga Diop, Semih Erden, Jan Vesley were really bad FT shooters. Even in todays NBA, Bogut (AUS, but still), Adams (NZ), Asik, are only a little better than Howard. A lot of the poor Euro FT shooters don't last in the league though, because they can't do other shit as well as Jordan and Howard. 

There are lots of American bigs who *can* make FTs too, just as well as the Euros: Garnett, Bosh, Anderson, Love, Aldridge, Frye.

humanhighlightreel,"Not at all if the shot went like a foot and a half from where he was aiming lol. Clutch means being able to perform under pressure, he performed poorly on this shot and got lucky.
"
humanhighlightreel,that's not why I was laughing
humanhighlightreel,"Dude. 2011 Kobe was awesome to watch, and was still an elite player. That said, if you think he was on par with LeBron, you are just straight up retarded. He was already a horrid defender, and relied on a ton of tough shots to get his offense. "
humanhighlightreel,"You're way overusing stats. Bird was the consensus best player in the world for like 6 years. He won 3 MVP's to Malone's 1 (if you say Malone won 2 MVPs I will bitch slap you). Most importantly, he was a guy that people were terrified of in big games or in the fourth quarter. Malone was the complete opposite - he was a big empty stat guy and a choke artist, and wasn't even the best player on his own team. The worst part isn't even the lack of rings - its the fact that he only made the Finals once. Its just not close at all. "
humanhighlightreel,"It was certainly diuchey, but as I said he came at me with the condescending shit first. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;There are certain sites that I've found out to be useful.

Such as?"
humanhighlightreel,"I am sure that is true, but he is still a minus defender.  At the end of the day Lin just isn't very good. I would much rather CJ Watson who is also a UFA and will likely come at the same price. "
humanhighlightreel,"Except MCW isn't a good facilitator, nor can he score when needed. "
humanhighlightreel,and you shouldn't comment on links you don't read. 
humanhighlightreel,"LeBron doesn't play the PF position because that position doesn't really exist in the NBA. Fans and media still use it, but in reality there are only guards, wings and posts. 

When LeBron plays the 4, his team is generally just using a different, to borrow a soccer term, ""formation"" than is typical. He always plays the majority of possessions on the perimeter. 

In fact he is often employed as a primary ball-handler above the break. I tend to consider him more of a guard than a wing for this reason, but he can play all three positions (guard, wing, post) and does. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean there are 3 qualified SFs who shoot worse than him, MKG, Carroll and Thad Young. Everyone else is better. That is weak as fuck.  

Shot blocking is different. He could be top 3 or 4 wings in the league in shot blocking if he wanted, he just chooses to play defence conservatively, and never chase blocks or foul. "
humanhighlightreel,yes there is. Ben Wallace. 
humanhighlightreel,What? Where do you see SRS?
humanhighlightreel,"I know what a motion offense is. But every offense in today's NBA needs shooting to space the floor. Teams have gotten too good at clogging the strong side and recovering (Thibs principles) to get away without it. You simply cannot win in modern basketball without three point shooting. If you want the Jason Kidd who can shoot threes, that would make the spacing better, but that Kidd just wasn't very good. "
humanhighlightreel,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FUCK YO COUCH PAUL
humanhighlightreel,"most blocks =/= best shot blocker. that said, I actually agree that Ibaka is better than Jordan. "
humanhighlightreel,"Without Love they could. To say it is disrespectful is just stupid, considering the Grizz (3.62 SRS vs. 4.08 for Cavs) were just as good this year even when Love was healthy. Cavs got better throughout the season, so I def think they would have won w/ Love, but without there is a very good chance they wouldn't have. "
humanhighlightreel,AFC

humanhighlightreel,"10% luck, 20% skill"
humanhighlightreel,"I respectfully disagree. Can I ask what your qualms with it were?

EDIT: WHO THE FUCK DOWNVOTES A COMMENT LIKE THIS. THAT IS ABSURD. "
humanhighlightreel,Because the East. Iversons is not that impressive - the best team he beat was 8th best in the league by SRS. That team would have probably lost in the first round in the West. 
humanhighlightreel,"The only guy that would justify taking the ball out of his hands is Chris Paul. *Maybe* Ty Lawson because he makes really quick, effective passes (doesn't dom ball) and never turns it over. "
humanhighlightreel,Clearly. 
humanhighlightreel,this is two weeks old. 
humanhighlightreel,"Not a great year for 2 guards to be honest. You could trade way down and pick up RJ Hunter, who I think would be a great fit. "
humanhighlightreel,"He did it after he raped that girl in Colorado.

"
humanhighlightreel,Aldridge to SAS; Monroe to PDX
humanhighlightreel,"This is a positive trend. Hiring/firing coaches in sports has always been far too results driven. In reality there are way too many factors influencing a teams' performance to assume a solid result means solid coaching. It is much more sensible to look at traits like innovation, adaptability, motivational abilities, etc. than team record. Bad coaches coach good teams all the time. 

This point should not be confused with whether teams are becoming too quick to fire coaches - that trend I think is negative. "
humanhighlightreel,"hey, if you asked me I would put him in in a heartbeat. I just don't think it will happen. "
humanhighlightreel,"Considering there has never been a coach to come straight from Euroleague to being an NBA head coach, this is not a surprise. "
humanhighlightreel,why would they hire monty in the first place if his race was an issue?
humanhighlightreel,want to make a bet with 1/1 odds? pls
humanhighlightreel,my bad. 
humanhighlightreel,Even if I had said FG% your comment would have been pretty irrelevant. 
humanhighlightreel,"I wouldn't say he is a better version of Kawhi. Kawhi is a significantly better defender than George, even though both are top ~5 in the league among perimeter players. The gap between Kawhi and Tony Allen and every other perimeter defender is pretty huge. 

But George has a better mid range game and a much quicker release on his jumper. He isn't an iso killer like Melo/LeBron/KD/Harden, but he is a much bigger scoring threat. "
humanhighlightreel,"The point is that they don't have to stay with TT or Moz. In 2015 having 2 off ball players you can't leave open is below average. ""Good spacing"" usually refers to teams with 3. 

My analysis is not incorrect, I assure you. "
humanhighlightreel,That's turrible
humanhighlightreel,"But again, that is just media shit. People rise and fall all the time - the media is reactionary just like us. A few months ago everyone had Okafor #1."
humanhighlightreel,.....what? why?
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, he had a good rookie year, then had hip surgery and was never the same. Its definitely a bad pick doe. Not that this is groundbreaking stuff, I would say most ppl on here would call Kahn's 09 draft one of the worst front office performances in history that didn't involve Dolan. "
humanhighlightreel,It doesn't seem to devalue the main ones in the NHL at all. 
humanhighlightreel,"i didn't try to support my argument. he supported his with the dumbest one possible. 

better to stay quiet and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt amirit?

but seriously, he was the best player on the 1-seed in the east. he is one of the best passing bigs in the league, a great rim protector, and a solid scorer. he also sets the dopest screens. he does everything on the court. "
humanhighlightreel,Hakim Warrick

humanhighlightreel,Tmac was closest friends to winning in 02 and 03 with the Magic. He was great in the playoffs in those years and a few others. He just never had the squad or the health luck to make a run. 
humanhighlightreel,"really? that was the least interesting use of that meme I have ever seen in my life, and that is saying something. have some originality brother."
humanhighlightreel,LBRNJMS
humanhighlightreel,"Oh, if I know I am getting him for the next x years, I am taking him first overall. That's a no brainer. But for the 2015 playoffs - no way. 8 is about right. If you wanted to convince me to take him above Westbrook I might, but none of those other guys. He is an incredible player, but his game is not as refined as some of the others.

It takes every star in history a long time to go from a breath-taking player capable of massive games and great stats to a guy who can lead a team to a championship. Davis still doesn't make his teammates better the way the guys ahead of him do. "
humanhighlightreel,The gators suck doe
humanhighlightreel,"no its not, unless you are including rebounding as a part of defense (which in the context of my comment I clearly wasn't). "
humanhighlightreel,Bryce Alford is such a cunt. Its literally the only word to describe him. 
humanhighlightreel,id fuck him
humanhighlightreel,"Its not that crazy. Blake Griffin, Pau Gasol and Elton Brand have all put up numbers similar to that in their rookie years.

that was probably the worst reddit comment I have seen today. you just a dumb fuck tryna sound like you know shit without even making a point. "

I would go for BPM, RPM, and WS/48. As we all know, however, it is impossible to reduce a players worth down to one number. 

Don't use TS%. Means nothing without volume. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah because he shoots less. He has gotten way more efficient and become a fantastic defensive player. 
humanhighlightreel,"Totally agree, its just then you can't do it back to the 60s. "
humanhighlightreel,"Is this half court? If so definitely team 1. Magic would not be that dominant without the transition game, and Duncan would just beast everybody. "
humanhighlightreel,"I think there is usually a time with young megastars where they are the most talented, and capable players in the league, but they lack the intuition regarding when to do what over the course of a basketball game and the abilities to get the most out of their teammates. I think LeBron was the most unstoppable player in the league by 2007, but I don't think he was the best player until around 2010.  "
humanhighlightreel,Agreed. Check this out https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33hmws/nba_passer_rating_end_of_season/
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;You know damn well Lou williams is a chucker though

Yes, but at least he was an efficient one. I don't like Lou and don't want to re-sign him, but there is no debate that we won a lot more games because of him this year. 

&gt;Dude takes some horrible shots 

Yes, he does. But he made a decent amount of them, and good shots are pretty tough to come by in our offense. 

&gt;and they don't work in the playoffs.

There may or may not be truth to the notion that they are less effective against playoff D's. But there are many examples of chuckers sparking key runs in the playoffs. And that is the point of chuckers - to spark the offense when things aren't going well. "
humanhighlightreel,"... he is a 2x champion, an mvp and a finals mvp"

humanhighlightreel,"I thought he meant in general, not just this year. "
humanhighlightreel,....are you fucking serious? god damnit Americans are dumb
humanhighlightreel,"Dude. The guy had less than 50 layups and 50 dunks this year (for the record, Chris Bosh - his most comparable player - had 74 and 146 respectively last year). 65% of his buckets came on jump shots. He also only got to the line 1.7 times per game, which is absolutely pathetic."
humanhighlightreel,well that was a waste of time
humanhighlightreel,"this is really ambiguous. do you mean move on *without* Ryno? Or move on *from* Ryno? Move on with Ryno would imply you are moving on, and Ryno is coming with you."

humanhighlightreel,You would have to pay me to accept Tim's

chances are, if one of these dudes does that (with reasonable efficiency) by their second year, they will end up being the best of the 3. For reference, AD was *exactly* 20 and 10 his second year. "
humanhighlightreel,"He also just shoots as soon as he gets the ball on offense. He has great touch so he is still relatively efficient, but he disrupts the flow of offense in my opinion. "
humanhighlightreel,"Just so you know, I don't think you can include LeBron to Miami as a move to a big market team. Miami plays in the leauge's 19th biggest media market ([Full Rankings](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2a5k0p/nba_media_market_rankings/)). Additionally, the franchise  known for a lack of fan interest prior to Shaq joining D-Wade in 05.

Really, if you are using a combination of size and fan interest to determine what constitutes a big market you should really only be including:

Tier 1: NY, LA, CHI

Tier 2: PHI, DAL, SF/OAK, HOU, BOS"
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, so does basketball. "
humanhighlightreel,"yes, it is still a double double. "
humanhighlightreel,"no he wasn't. he was arguably considered to have had the best season, but he was not considered the best player in the league. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's literally what I said - Bogut had the potential to be a rich mans Gasol. But he never was. 

And 09-10 Bogut was not that close to Gasol now. Sorry. Not only were those stats not accurate, but you cited his DRTG which is not even close to a good indicator of individual defense. Bogut was an elite defender already (so is Marc though, he has a DPOY for a reason) but he wasn't nearly as good on offence. Gasol is about to make First Team All-NBA and made his second ASG in the crowded West. Bogut was third team that year and didn't make ASG in the East. 

EDIT: who is up voting this scrub and down voting me? We are comparing the best C in the league to a 25 year old Bogut. This sub is absurd sometimes. "
humanhighlightreel,Your mom's a fleece
humanhighlightreel,"Right, which is why they might trade up to the Lakers pick if it costs them a second rounder or two. They would never do it if it meant trading two other picks and Dario fucking Saric.

humanhighlightreel,"You can be more than one thing, though. That is my point (and the point of dual-citizenship)"
humanhighlightreel,"Kevin Johnson was a top 4 guard for like 6 years through the first MJ 3peat, then became the Mayor of Sacramento and an uncharged rapist/molester. If you have forgotten about him, you aren't paying attention."

humanhighlightreel,he only 1 year away from being 2 years away doe
humanhighlightreel,"That's why I said true 4. Lamar definitely played a lot of small ball 4, especially in his Lakers days, but he started his career as more of a perimeter player. He was a 3/4.

humanhighlightreel,That's not a country. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, Garnett is probably the best P&amp;R stopper in history. If you have the all time blocks leader behind that, its gonna be hard to score. "
humanhighlightreel,"the whole ""fit it / fit out"" thing? of course those were aimed at Love. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean he is super talented on that end, but wasn't capable of maintaining his top form while also being a number 1 option. Same thing happened to Mike Conley.  

Only a few guys (MJ, Bron, Kobe, Hakeem to name a few) have really been able to be top dogs on both ends for more than a season or 2. Even LeBron was probably only consistently elite for like 2 years. "
humanhighlightreel,I have seen the OJ 30-for-30.
humanhighlightreel,"The first one. They are better at every position except C, have way more spacing for their best players to do work, and while they are worse defensively, it is not by that much. "
humanhighlightreel,...Harden was third in the NBA in made FGs this year. Your comment is just stupid. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, I mean straight up losing LMA would hurt obviously - for all my knocks on him he is still a good player and you guys don't have a ton of front court depth. But I would be watching really closely if they could get Millsap or Monroe to replace him. "
humanhighlightreel,"The Dubs fans who are here during the day are actually some of the most reasonable users IMO. If you go to game threads you have to expect this kind of behavior from any fan base, especially in the playoffs, because you get a lot more bandwagons, casual fans and fans who know nothing of the league beyond their own team. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah I would do that for sure.  
humanhighlightreel,&gt;am curious if there has ever been a team with multiple champions.
humanhighlightreel,doesn't mean they won't overlap. 
humanhighlightreel,oops. i thought we were in a different thread. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah but a bias needs to be preconceived (consciously or subconsciously). That's all I'm saying. There is no bias, they just messed up a few calls. Its par for the course. "
humanhighlightreel,"True, but Lebron isn't actually weak in these other areas. I think he is using the surprisingly large difference in advance stats that his relatively weak FT shooting makes to imply that it is actually the main thing holding him back from being better than Jordan. "
humanhighlightreel,"Um, someone actually did steal their three point powers. Based on their normal ability pretty much nobody was safe to leave open v. the Hawks. 

Dray shot &gt;35% on uncontested 3's this year. Not great, but enough to make you pay if you leave him. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;you refuse to acknowledge my point about Stein fitting well in a switch heavy defense

Yes, he can. I initially interpreted your comment as saying he can guard 1-5 like LeBron can, which would be a ridiculous comment since perimeter players would torch him. Once you elaborated to say that you meant he fit well in a switch-heavy offense, I commented that Henson is also fantastic hedging hard and switching on picks. It is one of his best strengths, due to his quickness and length. WCS might be even better on switches, or might be worse, but they are similar in that aspect of their games.  

&gt;and you've flip flopped 3 or 4 times between Lebron being able to OR not being able to guard all 5 positions.

I have never flip-flopped. I said he *can* guard 1-5. That is fact, because he has been given the assignment of guarding all 5 positions multiple times. I then elaborated that he has never been a *very good* defender at the 5, so its not something I would recommend. But he has been tasked to guard them all, which is something WCS will never be able to say. 

&gt;basically I make a valid point refuting your previous statement and then you take a stance completely contradictory to your previous stance, just so you can 'prove' me wrong

I have never flip flopped once. Perhaps I never should have brought up LeBron's mixed results guarding the 5 as it convoluted my point, but I was trying to be fair and honest about each player. "
humanhighlightreel,"yes, yes he does."
humanhighlightreel,"You think he was really better than Nene?

Also definitely wasn't the best non-American of all time. Hakeem Olajuwon? Dirk?"
humanhighlightreel,"no way. Dirk's longevity destroys him. Wade's best seasons may have been as good as Dirk's (Dirk has 1 MVP to Wade's 0, but Wade's 09 would have won in most years), but Dirk was a superstar for like 16 straight years. Wade is already on his way down in year 12."
humanhighlightreel,"True, but as I noted in my comments McAdoo is only there due to a technicality. "
humanhighlightreel,maybe dumb people. that was based on 6 games.

humanhighlightreel,"to be fair, you said ""to ignore pedantry"" and then you proceeded to address pedantry. "
humanhighlightreel,"I am not being a troll. I just said recency bias because that was most likely what was fueling your opinion. Korver was an All Star this year, and Beal is still not very good. Its not even a close discussion, so there had to be some kind of phenomenon behind your opinion. It is possible I was wrong, but it was certainly the most likely scenario, and after your response simply indicated that you didn't know what recency bias was, rather than that you weren't being effected by it, you can imagine why my opinion wasn't swayed by it. "
humanhighlightreel,"Lebron is using way more energy on defense than he did last year, and even two years ago in MIA"
humanhighlightreel,"I also think the improved ball movement at the 4 (let's be honest, LMA is not a good passer and Monroe is a very good one) could work wonders in getting more out of the rest of the starting lineup. Wouldn't be surprised if the Blazers were as good or better if this happened. "
humanhighlightreel,really?
humanhighlightreel,would be more interesting if you had used SRS. 
humanhighlightreel,"Every retired player with 7 has either made it or will make it except Jack Sikma and Larry Foust (and every active player except Johnson will). Grant Hill will 100% make it, TMac will also make it eventually. Joe Johnson might not, though the fact that he was an All Star last year was pretty ridiculous so that helps explain it. 

But I think you are underrating how easy it is to make the Naismith. It is way too liberal of a HOF. "
humanhighlightreel,"It doesn't matter. If you have Malone over Bird, you don't know shit about basketball. It's as simple as that. "
humanhighlightreel,"LeBron is also the second best player ever playing in a joke of a conference. 

Pop without Duncan might not have won at all, but Duncan without Pop would not have won close to 5. "
humanhighlightreel,"Ok. People probably don't like you much, do they?"
humanhighlightreel,"Here are my thoughts on the topic of awards. They need to be more specific:

First, I think it is a no brainer to have an annual NBA Awards show, like the NHL has. This would serve as a sort of 'banquet' for the players at the end of the playoffs, allow players to show off their ridiculous fashion sense and generally be a fun experience for fans.

Second, the award categories need to be improved, and more specific. You would also need more of them to have a show. I would go with the following awards (many inspired by the NHL, who absolutely crushes their award show):

**The Maurice Podoff Trophy**: Most valuable player to his team throughout the regular season. (2015 Winner: Steph Curry)

**Players Association Trophy**: Most valuable player to his team, as voted by his peers. (2015 Winner: who knows)

**Bill Russell Trophy**: Most valuable player to his team throughout the playoffs. Likely this would be awarded to a guy on the winning team anyway, I just think it makes sense to have one award for the regular season and one for the playoffs (rather than just the finals). (2015 Winner: TBD)

**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Trophy**: Best interior offensive player for the regular season. (2014 Winner: Anthony Davis)

**Michael Jordan Trophy**: Best perimiter offensive player for the regular season. (2015 Winner: Stephen Curry)

**Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy**: Best interior defensive player for the regular season. (2015 Winner: Tim Duncan)

**Gary Payton Trophy**: Best perimeter defensive player of the regular season. (2015 Winner: Kawhi Leonard)

**Wilt Chamberlain Trophy**: Most valuable rookie to his team throughout the regular season. (2015 Winner: Andrew Wiggins)

**James Worthy Trophy**: Most improved player from the regular season to the playoffs. (2015 Winner: TBD)

**Magic Johnson Trophy**: Best playmaker throughout the regular season. (2014 Winner: Chris Paul)

**John Havlicek Trophy**: Awarded to the player most capable of carrying bench-heavy units throughout the regular season. Player must not start more than half his games played. (2015 Winner: Isaiah Thomas)

**Steve Kerr Trophy**: Most sportsmanlike player from the entire NBA season. (2015 Winner: Tim Duncan)

**Walter J. Kennedy Citizenship Award**: Most outstanding service and dedication to the community (2015 Winner: Joakim Noah)

**Twyman–Stokes Award**: Best teammate throughout the entire NBA season. (2015 Winner: no idea)

**Red Auerbach Trophy**: Best coach of the regular season. (2015 Winner: Mike Budenholzer)

**Phil Jackson Trophy**: Best coach of the playoffs. (2014 Winner: TBD)

**Jerry Colangelo Trophy**: Executive whose influence has the most positive influence on his roster. (2015 Winner: Bob Myers)

**Sean Carter Trophy**: Awarded to the community leader most supportive of the NBA and dedicated to growing the game. (2015 Winner: Steve Balmer)

**Basketball Hall of Fame Inductions**: I think these should come at the end of the award show. I realize this is difficult because they are NBA awards, and the Naismith if for all of basketball, but I think it would be interesting and more people would watch the inductions.

"
humanhighlightreel,"Totally agree, but I actually think you misinterpreted what I meant; you are pointing to Docs that use sports as a vehicle to tell a story about the real world.

I was referring to how Once Brothers uses real world events to tell a story about teammates - and vice versa. Its more of a 2-way street, which is what I find compelling. The intensity of the situation in Yugoslavia is a vehicle to capture a human element of sports - that is what's rare in my mind. 

June 17, 1994 isn't really a sports story at all; Once Brothers is. 

Both amazing movies though.

Also worth noting that the 2012 Clips and 2008 Suns were below average defensive teams. They didn't lose because they took too many 3's, they lost because they couldn't stop anyone.

&gt;The 2004 Pistons were not offensively gifted in any way so if you are judging that team by pencil whipping stats in your searchbar then i have to presume you did not watch their grindfest style of play take over games.

I said they were the last *below* average 3pt shooting team. Can you read?"
humanhighlightreel,"that doesn't make him .2 better passer lol. he is a much better, and smarter offensive player than Jordan. 

- for every 100 passes Chandler throws, he assists on 3.5 of them and turns it over on 1.2 of them. For every 100 passes Jordan throws, he assists on 1.7 of them and turns it over on 1.2 of them.  Both these guys are low volume passers, but at the end of the day Chandler is more than twice as effective creating scoring opportunities than Jordan (whose 1.7 ranks last of anyone not named Hassan Whiteside). Its a massive difference - he is a rim diver first and foremost but is effective moving the ball when he does, which is why he can fit so seamlessly in any offense. Jordan simply is not; he is the second worst passer in the league. 

- There is also a pretty significant gap in their cutting - not in terms of athletic ability, but in terms of savy. If you don't guard Chandler away from the basket, he has ways of making you pay. People legitimately *don't* guard Jordan away from the basket. Some of that may be coaching, but Tyson just looks more creative moving without the ball to me. 

- Obviously the biggest difference between them on offense is FT shooting. 

Now, I am not saying there is no hope for Jordan on the offensive end. He is even more athletic than Chandler, is a better offensive rebounder, and is just as efficient around the rim. And you are right about his defensive impact - its not yet elite, but it is really good and getting better. He is absolutely a quality player in this league on the whole. But Chandler has been a legitimately helpful offensive player and a defensive stalwart for several years now (though his D has started to decline), and Jordan just isn't one at this stage. It isn't fair to say Chandler made his career doing what DJ does. "

always good to have an extra set of eyes out there."
humanhighlightreel,"why does the favorite have to be the winner of that series? 

if you ask me, the Warriors are favorites until they go down 3-1. "
humanhighlightreel,"They are not close. Everybody knows they are not close. Malone was a great offensive player, who was mediocre at defense (never deserved those first teams; they used to have no clue how to judge that and just gave it to rebounders), choked in the playoffs, and had the benefit of playing with the second best point guard ever for his whole career. Malone is probably the 4th or 5th best PF of all time; Bird is a top 5 player of all time. I am 100% sure you never watched either of these guys, because its not close. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, he averaged 20 a game that year. "
humanhighlightreel,"They haven't looked nearly as great with TT starting. TT has been great, but the spacing is awful. They have looked a lot worse than they did before. LeBron is willing them to close victories over a depleted ATL roster. With Love they were rolling as a unit and looked like a real championship contender. As it is they look like they will lose to GSW in 5. "
humanhighlightreel,LeBron in sandals could beat you in bricks
humanhighlightreel,"no, its changing the rules for the betterment of the game. shooting FTs is insanely important for bigs regardless of whether they are being hacked. "
humanhighlightreel,starks a bitch and biggie fucked his wife
humanhighlightreel,"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT RECENCY BIAS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING INTO MY OPINION. YOU ARE AN ARROGANT BUFFOON, AND AN UNORIGINAL REDDIT CLICHE. 

The Warriors have dominated the NBA to a far greater extent in the regular season than they Heat did. Nothing we have seen in the post-season has suggested that this was an aberration of any kind. It is a totally valid opinion to believe they are the better team - I think that they would beat more teams in the NBA more handily than the Heat would. 

Matchup-wise the Heat might be able to beat them, but don't accuse me of recency bias just because you don't want to make a legitimate argument."
humanhighlightreel,"It matters. When you get to the NFL, you (a) are a public figure, (b) have no money-related stressors in your life and (c) are getting a ton of counselling etc. to make sure things like that don't happen. Considering all that, the domestic violence and DUI rates are ridiculous.  "
humanhighlightreel,"not nearly as large. you can hide Curry on defense, and he is totally fine against the 3rd best perimeter player. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"No, I am aware you mentioned it as a possibility. I am just saying that the exact pieces you involved in your hypothetical show you know absolutely nothing about the NBA and have no credibility. "
humanhighlightreel,98.28% chance of an All Star between 5 and 60
humanhighlightreel,"I am not saying its ridiculous to have the Clips winning it all. All I said was welcome to reddit, where only the last 3 days matter. If you have the Clips winning, that is totally reasonable - hell, I put a future on them to win before the playoffs because I thought they were undervalued. 

But its the fact that a hugely disproportionate percentage of the sub has the Clips winning that I am talking about. If this sub were less reactionary, it would likely be more in line with Vegas. Its not like this is a particularly smart cross-section of fans, *especially in the playoffs*"
humanhighlightreel,not all of them. I have played with many-a-pussy in my life. that could be taken out of context. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;by State

He wasn't born in a state, so he's not represented. "
humanhighlightreel,"yes, a lot do. usually between 1.5 and 2.0 inches."
humanhighlightreel,"Pacific would be really nice

Steph Curry

PJ Tucker

Blake Griffin 

Boogie Cousins"
humanhighlightreel,"It is not comparable. When the Raps had a good record a lot of fans were excited and very annoying (not myself, I don't discuss the Raps on here often). That usually happens when a team is playing well. 

But with Bulls fans, anything negative you say will be met with the most unbelievable amount of responses and downvotes, no matter how logical it is.

Say Derrick Rose's buzzer beater was lucky? 35 comments in your inbox (and it was. he banked it accidently - good job getting the shot off over TT, a lot of people couldn't have done that - but he missed his target by like a foot and a half).

Say that his MVP in 2011 was kinda bullshit (which, true or not, is a fair argument)? -73 karma for you

Those are just examples off the top of my head, but it happens all the time.

It doesn't matter what time of year, how matter how you guys are playing, or whatever. Your fanbase practically searches this sub for any kind of slight on its team and comes in with the most ridiculous, belligerent shit.

At the end of the day, you should take it as a compliment, because it is a sign of your fan base's passion. But its fucking annoying."
humanhighlightreel,Because it comes down to value.
humanhighlightreel,Manu? Italian citizen and ethnically Italian. He is basically as Italian as Nash is Canadian. 
humanhighlightreel,"not sure why that adds anything... it would be 50/50 guards and non-guards anyway. 

besides, LeBron plays PG most plays on offense. "
humanhighlightreel,keep in mind he would be joining a staff where the head coach is clearly on the way out the door. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yes. He is the best defensive guard in the league. Also, Jimmy is super talented, but wasn't nearly as effective this year with the increased offensive work load. "
humanhighlightreel,"I am not saying Rose isn't clutch, just saying that shot doesn't go on his clutch resume. "
humanhighlightreel,Edited
humanhighlightreel,"I am not suggesting that you have only been watching him recently, I am suggesting that your opinion of him is likely putting too much weight on recent performances, when he is likely to regress towards the mean.

Korver is better than Beal right now on both sides of the ball, but if you polled /r/nba *right now* asking who was better, you would get a lot of people saying Beal because he had 28 points yesterday and beat Korver, who when 5-15 (and some other great games over the last few weeks)."
humanhighlightreel,He was 31
humanhighlightreel,"Portland for sure. That was mostly narrative stuff about Dirk being soft anyway. The only team better than the Mavs by SRS that they beat was LA. OKC was on a nice run, but it was a fairly evenly matched series on paper. "
humanhighlightreel,I heard he don't shower after games doe

humanhighlightreel,"Well on this sub and in the media explosiveness=athleticism and athleticism = potential, so the most explosive player is always going to be the most popular answer. In reality, coordination is a very real  genetic (not saying it can't be improved, but it is just as genetic as explosiveness) trait that affects potential. Okafor is the most coordinated big I have seen since probably Dirk Nowitzki. He is going to be score at will at the next level, where double teaming is a more dangerous prospect. He has the most potential. "
humanhighlightreel,Two of the best five seasons in NBA history were the Bucks in 71 and 72 
humanhighlightreel,"Nothing worse than fans who cite FT discrepancies as evidence for poor officiating. There can be very real reasons for them.

However, I was not a fan of the officiating last night, either. "
humanhighlightreel,"I thought he was a guaranteed franchise player and perennial all star, but no matter how good a prospect is you cannot reasonably expect them to get as good as LeBron has. So I would say about 80% of where he is now. "
humanhighlightreel,"I really don't think he will, but the media likes to talk about it. I could see him taking a few meetings but doubt he will leave. "
humanhighlightreel,That's a bit of an exaggeration. He wasn't a starter. He is good but a borderline NBA player. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, as I said, overall he was a very good teammate. But there were definitely a few times he took it too far with Rio. He is a prodigious basketball player, and a fine leader, but he is not an infallible teammate. That is all I am saying. "
humanhighlightreel,"Delly is also a horrible defender though. I don't think Curry would be as good as him, but if its curry for &lt;1mm or delly for ~3, I am not thinking twice. "
humanhighlightreel,True dat. Thx.
humanhighlightreel,There are enough people who would argue that Kobe was never the best player in the league. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Jerry Muthafuckin West.

I know who you meant. His nickname is The Logo"
humanhighlightreel,I thought they got a lot of good looks last game. The shots will start falling. Ball movement still looks great. They really miss Horford having a midrange though. 
humanhighlightreel,"Lakers-Celtics; Cavs-Bulls; Knicks-Pacers; Rockets-Mavs; some love triangle of the Spurs, Lakers, Suns; Raptors-Paul Pierce.

humanhighlightreel,"OK, who is the best player ever from your sovereign state?"
humanhighlightreel,I would be all for the NBA bringing back territorial picks. Would make it much more meaningful when cheering for your local team.
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;And if she were gay instead of trans, would it have been OK for him to go to her investors and say, ""you know she's a lesbo, right?""

Totally different situation. She changed her name and identity. That was part of the evidence that she wasn't who she said she was. If he had said, ""Essay Annie Vanderbilt isn't actually a Vanderbilt, she changed her name,"" you don't think the investor would have said, ""OK, so what's her real name?"" You would have to tell the story of the fraud without the story of the gender change. It is part of the story, even if it makes the story sensitive. 

&gt;and in this case it drove a woman o suicide.

Debatable. She had attempted suicide shortly before, and Hannan never said he was going to out her. Any number of reasons could have driven her suicide. 

&gt;Her personal life and professional credentials were not related. At all.

Yes they were. See first point. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Size like height or weight? Please leave that one out it has little to do with athleticism.

Actually it doesn't. Size and strength present an advantage in sports, so therefore are an important part of athleticism. LeBron is more athletic than Nate Robinson because he is basically as fast/quick, but he is much bigger. 

&gt;MJ was faster and more agile than LeBron.

Not sure why you are bringing MJ into this. We are talking about Vince. But in reality, MJ was more agile than LeBron, but probably not as fast in a sprint. "
humanhighlightreel,"The Warriors this year were the 6th best team in NBA history. They are in a league of their own, and have been all year. The Grizz impressively took them to 6, but I doubt any other team will. They were uncharacteristically missing open jumpers in both those games. 

Also worth noting they swept the Rockets 4-0 in the regular season. "
humanhighlightreel,"Classic underrating of Moses. Alex English over him? Moses won 2 MVPs (plus one in 79), a Finals MVP, and a ring in the 80s and made every single All Star game. English never even made first team All-NBA. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"That's not entirely true. The Spurs in 2013 basically did what the Bulls did last night and clogged things up for him. He made them pay, as he has to a lot of other teams. Sure, he is unstoppable on the plays when he posted up Jimmy 1-on-1, but there wasn't always space for that. The Bulls wanted him to take jumpers, and were pretty lucky he missed a bunch he usually hits. "
humanhighlightreel,Wow! What a great measure of defense! I concede!
humanhighlightreel,the mods deleted it (it was Luke Ridnour). 
humanhighlightreel,That was my mistake. LeBron was really 2.599 that year. 
humanhighlightreel,Would you rather have $1 or have your local WNBA team win a national championship?
humanhighlightreel,Rap fans were arguably overreacting to the winning more than they are right now. 
humanhighlightreel,"I can't stand it when players get an erection mid play, and the mods try to cover it up. "
humanhighlightreel,"A bit overrated. For all his brilliance, you either have to give him the reigns to the offense or not get all of him. I am just not sure that an offense that reliant on one guy can succeed in the current NBA. I don't think we will ever get 2015 Russ on a contender, and I don't think 2014 Russ is a top 5 player. Top 10 for sure, but closer to Wall than to Curry or Paul.
"
humanhighlightreel,"I didn't say no because Bosh missed a season. I just brought up the missed season because it will probably affect his play at his age. Mainly its because Boogie is better than Bosh 

George I also said might have lost a step and wouldn't take him if that's the case. He is a huge mystery. "
humanhighlightreel,He is a mediocre defender and an awesome rebounder. Second team would have been acceptable. First team over Duncan and Bogut is absurd. 
humanhighlightreel,&gt;Born
humanhighlightreel,"This is the weirdest post ever. But generally I agree with you that Hakeem would fare better as a lone superstar on his team - I mean he did, he lead his team in Pts, Rebs, Ast, Blks and Stls on the 94 Championship squad. 

Also, while it is true that Jordan was retired when Hakeem won, it would have been interesting were he not. I know everyone on here thinks that the Regular season is some silly exhibition circus, but the Bulls always struggled against Hakeem and the Rockets. Hakeem is 13-10 against MJ, and was 10-5 when MJ first retired. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"It does, because I had to remove secondary assists to make the stat more meaningful from a value add perspective. LMA does a lot better in terms of secondary assists. But its not as though he is tops in the league - a lot of PFs are still ahead of him. And he should do very well by that stat because he is double teamed so often. 

The biggest problem with LMA though is just that he doesn't pass enough - the effective of his passes is secondary. "
humanhighlightreel,"Tough question. To some people he was, but he is the weakest name here for sure. "
humanhighlightreel,THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION
humanhighlightreel,"Westbrook or **John Wall**

Jimmy Butler or **Klay Thompson**

Kevin Love or **Andrew Wiggins**

**James Harden** or Russell Westbrook

**Prime Kobe** or Prime Wade

**Kevin Love** or Chris Bosh

Derrick Rose or **Kyrie Irving**

**Victor Oladipo** or Bradley Beal"
humanhighlightreel,"I am looking at legitimate advanced stats, as well as watching him play often. Also noticing how the league's 16th best D has 2 first team players lol. Take off your homer glasses. "
humanhighlightreel,That would be a great argument if it were true. 
humanhighlightreel,That's why you use attendance % (which I did) which clearly has them at 20th. 
humanhighlightreel,"Why do people assume others are worked up, when reading text?

Regardless, its not debatable. I am not ignorant. Billups was a top 5-10 PG. There are lots of guys who could have stepped into his role.

And yeah, Sheed was a good post defender, but they would have been out 3 rounds before they even met Shaq w/o Ben, so not sure why you are bringing him up. "
humanhighlightreel,"Dolan isn't very involved in the Rangers. Also the pressure of playing in the country's largest market *and* the supposed mecca of basketball adds crazy pressure to the Knicks that has fostered some really dumb ""get rich quick"" schemes that have hurt the franchises long-term health. No hockey team in the US really faces a lot of scrutiny. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, if a guy is winning back to back MVP's, there are some people who think he is the best player in the world. 06-10 is really tough, because the best regular season guys had some really bad luck, and some choking in the playoffs, while best stat guys (Kobe and LeBron) were on shit teams. There is just no clear cut answer there, but Nash is one of 4 *acceptable* ones. Personally, I tend to agree with you that Kobe was better, but probably Dirk over Kobe for a few of those."
humanhighlightreel,"Not neccessarily, a lot of those were intentional fouls. However, as I said, it was also a poorly officiated game. "
humanhighlightreel,that floored me. no clue why
humanhighlightreel,"Stanley Johnson is kinda just like a shitty MKG. Strong as fuck; only scores in transition. I am not sure he is a fit. 

Devin Booker is, but I would honestly rather trade down and snag RJ Hunter. I think he will go between 16 and 20, but will be better than Booker. "
humanhighlightreel,Ni Hao means hello (roughly) lol
humanhighlightreel,"The point is that if the Warriors had managed minutes like a normal NBA team, they would have the best offense. "
humanhighlightreel,why waste good cheese?
humanhighlightreel,username is relevant. 
humanhighlightreel,"I agree with that - that is the entire point of the post - but if they both had these seasons several years in a row, you would have to say Curry is better. "
humanhighlightreel,"Al Horford. I don't hate the Hawks, but if I did I would still have nothing but respect for this dude. He is a consummate professional, never complains, does all the little things that makes his team win, and has one of the most complete basketball games I have ever seen on both sides of the ball. He also [fresh as fuq](http://i.imgur.com/W21ilnS.jpg) without looking like a clown. I can't say one negative thing about Al Horford. "
humanhighlightreel,wow. crazy that 11 french people and a french-speaking swiss would make an english film
humanhighlightreel,he didn't have much potential. all he is capable of is rebounding and he has been one of the best rebounders in the league for over a decade. pretty good career for a guy with minimal skill. 
humanhighlightreel,"you're joking, right?"
humanhighlightreel,"except that wasn't due to bias, it was do to coincidence/momentum. there is not conspiracy theory at play"
humanhighlightreel,"**The way we list positions:**

Curry and Paul are not up for debate. 

If you wanted to convince me of Wall &gt; Westbrook due to the way they play within a system, I would listen to you. But those are the only 4 in the discussion. 

**In reality:**

Curry, Paul and Harden"
humanhighlightreel,"If you would take Paul on the Spurs or Atlanta, you are out of your tree. Those are the two most ball-movingest teams in the league. They don't need a sticky player like Paul. "
humanhighlightreel,"There has been multiple future all stars in every draft in history. There is a 99% chance there will be a future all star in any given draft. He was just being a tool. That's like correcting me saying ""if I drop this pen it will hit the floor"" by saying ""gravity is just a theory"". "
humanhighlightreel,"Not at all if you read the content (which doesn't mention your life, btw). It is very clearly bolded for the sake of irony - while I comment on the obviousness that most reddit statements ""can't be known for sure"" I emphasize a note that one of mine can't. "
humanhighlightreel,he was born in DC. 
humanhighlightreel,"Not by this question. KD is better at hitting the shots he creates, but I don't consider him that great of a shot creator. He gets a lot of bucket on assists and pull up jumpers. He has a nice step back, but not that good of a post game, and Melo's step back is dope too. "
humanhighlightreel,CP3. Easier to build a contender around IMO. 
humanhighlightreel,"OK, but are their parents Italian immigrants (probably not all) and do they maintain citizenship? I am not suggesting that Manu is any less Argentinian, only that he is also Italian. My point is that you can be more than 1 thing, hence the concept of dual-citizenship. "
humanhighlightreel,all stop using Ernst &amp; Young LLP for our audit needs. 
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, he did get caught cheating with Joe Smith. Not saying he is a bad guy but I wouldn't go out of my way to call him respectable. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I think if Wall is 100% healthy, and Horford's hand is fucked, WAS probably wins. But if every player in the series is 100%, I am still going with ATL. "
humanhighlightreel,Steve Nash?
humanhighlightreel,i agree. Was just wondering why ppl were acting like Rose was so clutch. 
humanhighlightreel,Yeah but for every DeAndre Jordan there are a million big athletic guys who can't play. And WCS isn't changing much because he is a Jr. 
humanhighlightreel,"20 or 30 drafts is a small sample size, but 1,264 draftees is not. 

From the time the draft went to 2 rounds (1989) to 2010 (last five drafts will still have more first time all stars) that is how many players have been drafted to the NBA. Of those players, 10.25% have gone on to make an ASG. 

Using that figure, we can determine that when picking a 60 NBA players, there is a 0.15% chance that 0 will be All stars. 0.15%! I could give you 500:1 odds that there will be an All Star in the next draft, and it would be me making the smart bet. 

You were not being nitpicky in order to be careful or not make unfair assumptions. You were being nitpicky to be a dick (either that or you have very little intuition when it comes to probability). 

"
humanhighlightreel,I get what he meant. Its not what he said.
humanhighlightreel,pretty clear who the kid is around here
humanhighlightreel,"Dribbling, passing, shooting are all of central importance and are all taught to all players. There is nothing special about FT shooting, especially in 2015 basketball. "
humanhighlightreel,"How can the calls be biased to both teams? That would mean they are just wrong, not biased. "
humanhighlightreel,...yes you can. but he was 6/13 from deep last night anyway so its only 3 games. 
humanhighlightreel,"Absolutely, but in New York, LA, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, etc. you could put the stadiums anywhere you want (within reason), and attendance would still be 100%. "
humanhighlightreel,"See I just disagree. I am obviously against the outing of transgender people, but I think when a person exploits their own gender identity to commit fraud they forego any right to privacy. 

If Dr. V was not a transsexual, and Hannan had outed to her investors the fact that she was a criminal who had created fake credentials in order to sell them on a bogus putter, would you take issue with it then? Would you say his promise not to focus on ""the scientist"" should continue to bear weight in that situation? I certainly wouldn't. 

Certainly the gender identity issue made the story more interesting, and Hannan definitely did not approach the topic with enough sensitivity. That is a fair criticism, but that's the world we live in - transgender people are only just becoming a normal part of American society. At the very least the mistakes he made opened up a dialogue about how things could have been done differently. 

But at the end of the the fact that Dr. V was born a man was absolutely part of the story, and that is on her for trying to defraud her investors. "
humanhighlightreel,I would do that. 
humanhighlightreel,seemed pretty good in 2013
humanhighlightreel,"As I said it depends what the fillers were. I don't think we could get a high draft pick, and I love Jones as the primary player asset."
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah that's basically what I said elsewhere in the thread. It was a weird season for the Kings, but pre-meningitis he was a 2-way beast. He has fully convinced me he can be a great defender at the 5, which was basically the only thing holding him back. "
humanhighlightreel,"That would be a good point if it was true. Harden = turnovers in one game, but generally he is right in line with the league's best PGs (minus CP3 of course who is on another level). His TOV% is in line with Westbrook and Curry, and well ahead of Wall."

But GOAT refers to how good you were at basketball, and LeBron is not as good as MJ was. He is pretty close, but most people who have watched both know this to be true. LeBron is not getting better, so he is not going to pass MJ, that's all there is to it. "

humanhighlightreel,Tyson became a really good offensive player. He's a smart cutter and a surprisingly deft passer out of rim dives.
humanhighlightreel,"Yes. He has improved tremendously on that end. It was a weird season for the Kings, but during the pre-meningitis run, he was beasting on both ends. And he was still much improved the rest of the year. His only remaining weaknesses are turnovers and temper, and those will probably improve as his game matures. "
humanhighlightreel,i dont get it
humanhighlightreel,"I liked the Sonics throughout the 90's - I was obviously excited by the Raps, but there was a ~4 year transition period for my fandom. "
humanhighlightreel,"Not around 2014 Duncan. He was a great player, but without once forgotten players like Danny Green and Boris Diaw they don't come close to a championship. Pop gets the most out of everyone he coaches. "
humanhighlightreel,"I said may not. You could argue either way, depending on whether you value rings or MVPs more. But LeBron is better, and that is plain to the naked eye. All that other stuff is just fluff."
humanhighlightreel,I know what SRS is bro. I am asking why he is bringing it up.

humanhighlightreel,"On the surface, yes. But Love is a much better offensive basketball player than Ibaka is in a multitude of ways. It would have been an easier transition, because Ibaka is used to being a 3rd banana and complements the weaknesses of LeBron and Kyrie better, but the upside is not nearly as high. "

humanhighlightreel,"in the 80s a lot of people considered Jordan a gunner, whose play style wasn't conducive to winning a lot. I think its fair to say that he wasn't the consensus best in the world until 1990, even though his stats were by far the best. That's kind of the point of this exercise. "

humanhighlightreel,"Fair, but its not the same as SRS, because it is not SOS-adjusted. I am not trying to make predictive observations with these numbers either. 

There is no issue with sample size when deducing Pythagorean wins in a small sample size to determine how many games a team was expected to win. Sure, it will be less accurate than over a large sample, but it is still meaningful. If I were using point differential to deduce who was the better basketball team based of 6 games, that would be a different story. "

humanhighlightreel,"Because it is illogical and would make the sport better. Fouling in every other sport results in a penalty, not an advantage. "
humanhighlightreel,That's not neccesarily true. Cassell's emergence and the addition of Clyde the Glide made the team a lot more complete in 95. Hakeem was probably more impressive individually in 94.
humanhighlightreel,"Rose. Lowry is good (a lot better than he was at the end of this year), but his hot streak until January was unsustainable. He is a 29 year old steady G who can play good D and not turn it over, and can make tough shots when he has to. He is not a star or a number one option, at least not for more than a few months at a time. 

There is still hope for Rose to be a franchise player, something that is hard to come by in the NBA (especially in Toronto)"
humanhighlightreel,I don't think the Rockets fire McHale. He was much improved all season and is losing to a better team. 
humanhighlightreel,Nah I just know how overrated Aldridge is. 
humanhighlightreel,Not like that
humanhighlightreel,"He is not incapable at all on offense, he is just weirdly one-dimensional for such a great athlete. He is a really great spot up shooter from deep and mid-range, but beyond that his play is uninspiring. He is not strong out of the P&amp;R, where as a Kevin Love screen can result in a massive array of offensive sets (pick and pop, pass out of the pick and roll, variety of creative in-between shots, servicable rim dives and mismatches in the post). 

He also creates offense in transition, and provides more spacing than Ibaka (they shoot similar percentages, but Love has the quicker release, is better at shooting on closing out defenders, and requires more attention because he can beat you off the dribble or with passes). 

Ibaka's defense is miles ahead of Love, but Love closes the gap a bit with his rebounding, and he is a fine positional defender so as long as he is with Mozgod, he is effective. 

As I said, the transition would be easier cause Serge could just sit on the 3 point line and knock down shots while playing solid D. But the versatility that a talent like Love gives you increases your ceiling. "
humanhighlightreel,"not worked up in the slightest. 

as I said, teams that don't might grab a prospect who could shoot, like Curry, but they would certainly not hire anyone who didn't have the ability to be a legitimate NBA players for other reasons. "
humanhighlightreel,"I think so. He isn't as flashy as some other picks, but a versatile big man who can protect the rim is insanely valuable in today's game. he is also probably the second best passing big in the league after Blake. "
humanhighlightreel,"The Label? 

lol

Also Dr. J and Moses pls."
humanhighlightreel,agreed - at least on par with Kareem. 
humanhighlightreel,"yes, I mean exactly like that. "
humanhighlightreel,No. They need a secondary ball handler who can shoot off the ball and play acceptable D. Lin is a primary who can't do either very well.

That said, finding him has a lot more to do with luck than who is your GM/Pres. "
humanhighlightreel,"That is what ""hurt"" means. 

Regardless, its very obvious that I meant a serious injury that would prevent him from playing. "
humanhighlightreel,"The hype has died down because people are impatient. Giannis is a freak, and is new to high level basketball (he was playing in C division in Greece). 

He is already an above average defender, which is crazy due to his experience level. He will probably be a top 5 defender eventually, and his ceiling is the best in the league. 

He has great touch from all over the floor already, except struggled from 3. But he has the form to get there. Even if he doesn't, dude is big enough to play PF once he fills out, and is efficient inside and at the line. He is also a talented ball handler and passer. He doesn't know the nuances of NBA offense yet, but all the tools are there. 

He has the 24th most win shares in a season for a 20 year old ever, and hes played much less basketball than all those others. 

There are no guarantees in the NBA, but Giannis could easily be a top 5 player in the league one day - the hype has just died because this is /r/nba "

humanhighlightreel,What about em?
humanhighlightreel,"Because all those players are guards, and only two of them usually play together. You aren't a team without shooters, but compared to the Dubs the floor spacing is mediocre. 

I am not doubting LeBron's ability to drive and kick; that has little to do with spacing the floor though. Not sure why you brought that up. Spacing the floor would result in people *not* being left open for threes while LeBron gets a 1-on-1. Him dragging in defenders is indicative of his ability, not spacing. "
humanhighlightreel,They are a lot better than LeBrons. 12% true shooting isn't some minor part of their statistical output. It is massive. 
humanhighlightreel,I also like him. He's a neat guy. 
humanhighlightreel,"but they don't have fans. that is the point. 

EDIT: sorry, reddit. I meant to say they don't have a lot of fans. apologies for using hyperbole - they have some fans.

but they were 20th in the league at 93% attendance in a year where they were the 1-seed. last year they were 26th at 77%. they do not have a lot of fans compared to most previous finals teams."
humanhighlightreel,No they couldn't have. They aren't as good of a basketball team. 
humanhighlightreel,"Dubs in 5. 

The Cavs have fought admirably in these playoffs without Love, but the competition and luck has been favorable. Leaving out the Celtics:

Against the Bulls (10th best team by SRS) they won in 6, but after 5 games there was a 2 point differential between the 2 teams. I commend the Cavs on their resiliency to close out the series, but in reality they looked quite evenly matched with a good-but-not-great Bulls team. The offense was mediocre with limited spacing due to Love's injury. They prevailed with energy, rebounding and hard-nose defense. 

Against the Hawks (4), the offense looked much better, but was still reliant on offensive rebounding and ball protection, not particularly efficient shooting as the poor spacing prevailed (until game 4, at least). The improved flow surely was partially due to some great shooting and playmaking from LeBron, but Korver, Hordord and Carroll all missed significant time. The Hawks D was horrendous as a result. 

Those teams were ranked 19th and 23rd in defensive rebounding, respectively, and both had their some of their best rebounders struggling due to injury. 

The Warriors were far from elite at 18th, but that was drastically improved when Bogut was on the floor (would rank first, an extra 10 minutes per game from him would have had them around 5th). I expect TT and Moz will still have some success on the offensive glass, but the at what cost. The Dubs are one of the best transition teams ever. If you are crashing 2 players against them, you are gonna give up a lot of buckets unless you get to a lot of those misses. 

The only way that the Cavs are going to beat the Dubs is if they can shoot more efficiently. With the Dubs great interior D (far better than the Bulls or Hawks) and the terrible spacing in the TT/Bron/Moz lineup, that is not going to happen at the rim and I just don't like the Cavs chances trying to outshoot the Dubs from deep. If the Cavs pull this off, it will have to be LeBron's best Finals performance yet. "

humanhighlightreel,for real? 
humanhighlightreel,Agreed. 
humanhighlightreel,"Every championship team in history has been strong in multiple areas. Teams that have shot a lot of threes have been incredibly successful, but only those with other strengths. Your comment that three point shooting teams fail in the playoffs is just plain wrong. One dimensional teams fail in the playoffs. "
humanhighlightreel,Jahlil doe. Paralysis by analysis. This dude is the best player in the draft by far. 
humanhighlightreel,nope. he just is. hops =/= athleticism. 
humanhighlightreel,maybe not though
humanhighlightreel,Yeah. I would rather see them save a little cash and make a play at Millsap. He would be great with Bron. 
humanhighlightreel,"Completely agree, as I said. You should undoubtedly match. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, but they are based on the percentage of the cap when the deal is signed. If Davis signed a 2 year deal or a deal with an early termination he could sign a deal worth over 30 million per year plus annual raises (assuming he makes another All-NBA team) when the cap goes to 108 mill in 2017. The cap is expected to fall thereafter so his subsequent contract coild be smaller if he waits. "
humanhighlightreel,really? 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;What about efficiency..? He's a bad shooter yet takes a surprising number of midrange shots, and isn't even very efficient at the basket (63% from 0-3 ft).

He is playing on a bad team with poor spacing. He is a talented scorer all over the court. He shoots around 40% on mid range shots which is good for a big, but he has to take too many because he is on a dysfunctional offense. And again, under Malone he was much more efficient. 

&gt;Plus he turns it over a ton and racks up a lot of PFs

I mention this elsewhere in the thread. I wasn't suggesting that was his only weakness, just that it was the only thing keeping him from being elite. Even with the TOVs, he is an elite offensive big. "
humanhighlightreel,"No they shouldn't. Teams are too liberal with that shit as it is - in 50 years there are going to be no good numbers left. You retire jerseys of FRANCHISE players. Guys who were your best player for like 10 years and made multiple All Star games. At the very least someone shorter tenured who brought you rings. 

Retiring the jersey of your fourth best player on your Finals squad cause he stuck around a few years is just unreasonable. He did a lot for the Orlando Magic, enough to make up for missing 4 straight, but there is no reason to hang his jersey in the rafters. "
humanhighlightreel,"Right, but to give up your first round pick and John Henson (an already fantastic defensive player with similar offensive issues) you would need someone near DeAndre's level to justify it. I am not saying the WCS can't be good enough to justify a 10th overall pick, but given his risk/reward profile I would never justify giving up both those assets. I would probably not give up just John Henson. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;I could see teams saying foul DJ once Chris Paul passes

Last guy to possess it still has possession until someone new does, or it becomes a loose ball. 

&gt;Or foul whoever off the ball anytime DJ has possession. 

In that case you could just foul DJ, anyway. "
humanhighlightreel,"this is a massive, salty overreaction to reddits comments about salt and overreactions."
humanhighlightreel,"there is nothing in the NBA that says players/teams have to release accurate measurements. at the combine they do both because they want to gather the data (I don't really see a necessity). beyond that it is completely up to the players which they want to use, if they want to update it going forward, etc. 

We will never have accurate height information for veteran players. "
humanhighlightreel,no. 
humanhighlightreel,"That's why I think C would win. Curry and Davis would be perfectly happy playing off ball all game, and LeBron spreads it around enough to keep Kobe and Ewing happy. "
humanhighlightreel,oh
humanhighlightreel,Blakes are in a different stratosphere than any other big in the NBA.

humanhighlightreel,They can borrow John Valanciunas if they want. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Yeah, guess I kind of stopped short on an explanation there. The problem I see is that you are making a trade off too much in favor of the ball possessing team. The defending team picks up a foul, gets the opposing FT% raised, and puts a good rebounder on the block? Seems like way too much to me. Which is kind of the whole argument, punish teams who intentionally foul, right.

The point is that it would never happen, because intentional fouling would be gone. But even if it did, that's not really unfair - if the ball handler were to fire a shot at the time of the foul, the big would be there to rebound. Not really unfair to me. 

&gt;So what's the alternative? Just foul the shit out of DJ anytime he touches the ball? Seems to be encouraging a different poor style of play. It's basically 5 on 4 until he touches the ball then everyone rushes to foul him.

This can happen anyway, and is totally fair. You should be able to foul these guys when they have the ball. "
humanhighlightreel,"1. Don't listen to ESPN. It is by no means unanimous.

2. Towns' stock is higher right now because (a) Jah choked in the tournament and (b) Jah's game has been picked apart way more. 

3. Okafor is undervalued because of the ridiculous amount of defensive attention he received all year. I have never seen a player get that many double teams, and he still put up absurd numbers. 

3. People get way too caught up with explosive players. 

Okafor is just a better basketball player than Towns. He was expected to be the number 1 pick this year after high school, and he only exceeded expectations. Its simply paralysis by analysis. 

Once workouts begin, the tune will likely change. "

Its just not comparable. Jordan has a lot of muscle on his frame, but he is still skinny as fuck.  Shaq weighed 53 pounds more than DJ at the combine. Doubt DJ has put on 50 more pounds in the last 7 years than Shaq did in his first 4 (I know Shaq is 2 inches taller, but that doesn't correspond to 50 lbs)"

humanhighlightreel,"I mean, its one game. Almost every other team has a better backup PG, so in relative terms he is awful. "
humanhighlightreel,"Nobody will agree with me, but I still think Klay should be top 2 with Butler. All those other guys were young players who made a leap due to becoming more comfortable as a result of experience and had number increases due to an increasing role. I think MIP is a stupid award, but if we have to have it I think it should go to established players who very noticeably improved aspects of their game through hard work, because there are second and third year bench players that make leaps seemingly out of nowhere every year. 

Thompson didn't improve as much as Whiteside, DMo or Gobert in absolute terms, but the difficulty of going from where he was (pretty one dimensional shooter about to get *wayyyy* overpaid) to a legitimate max player getting MVP votes is much more difficult to make. What's more, from the eye test he went from one of the most frustrating players in the league due to his inability to do anything off the dribble, even with shooters closing out at 100 mph, to a legitimate all-around offensive force. He made a leap that I never thought he would."

humanhighlightreel,y u talking about his legacy. homie is 23 and fighting valiantly. his legacy will be just fine. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;His efficiency numbers were incredibly high in college on account of his defense, trips to the FT line, and rebounding (Arizona was the best defensive rebounding team in the country, and he was their second-leading rebounder - from the 2 position)

This is exactly what made MKG efficient in college too lol. I realize he doesn't have a completely broke jumper, but he does struggle to make plays in the half court. He is not a very crafty player - almost everything he got for himself in college was due to his strength. "
humanhighlightreel,didn't know TT was gay. congrats Tristan. 
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, he isn't a good backup. He is shooting well now, but he is one of the worst backup PGs in the league. "
humanhighlightreel,"OK. But that is a very specific definition, and is not universal by any means. It is also not in line with the actual definition of the word greatest, which is not substantially different from the word best. If you are trying to say one player is more accomplished than another,  but not better, just say it. There is no need for these ridiculous, made-up definitions. "
humanhighlightreel,"Curry, mainly because he is equally effective on or off the ball. That versatility is pretty underrated. CP3 is capable of crazy shit like game 7, but he also has had a few series collapses because the team is gonna be on his back in the 4th no matter what. Curry just adds value for every possession of every game no matter the situation, system, lineup, etc. "

humanhighlightreel,"eh, I disagree. a lot of people on here are and always have been critics of AI. there are lots of unbiased opinions. a lot of people probably believe that he was truly elite regardless of their personal feelings towards him too - its not an unreasonable claim, though I disagree with it. "
humanhighlightreel,no you didn't.
humanhighlightreel,why?
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, but being a mediocre FT shooter for 200 shots as a freshman in college, after being totally fine (&gt;60%) in HS, feels more like an aberration than an issue. DJ and Dwight are fast twitch athletes with stone hands. Jah has amazing hands and is money from 15 feet in game.  "
humanhighlightreel,"Which he cannot. He can hedge hard on pick and rolls and grab them for a second, but he cannot guard perimeter players. You implied he could *guard* 1-5, not just stay in front of them for a moment. "
humanhighlightreel,I don't think he is trying to say anything other than that its a cool coincidence. 
humanhighlightreel,NOT ALLOWED TO USE THAT ARGUMENT BRO
humanhighlightreel,"How do you combine them? Do you get to choose specific facets of each, like Shaq's size and LeBron's athleticism? Or does everything get averaged out? Its also complicated because some peoples' body types enable their skill - for example Shaq with Chris Paul's dribbling skill would not be as good as Chris Paul's, because his dribble would be too high etc. 

I think I would go with Hakeem and Dirk. Their skill sets lend themselves to relatively the same position, which I think generates additional returns relative to some mutt hybrid of a C and a PG - where would that guy even play? "
humanhighlightreel,"wouldn't call it a conspiracy, just reasonable arguments that many people have made. there is not question its his second most likely landing spot, but he lives in PDX and they can offer him the most $$$. if he decides they offer enough from a bball standpoint, he will stay. otherwise he will go to SAS. "
humanhighlightreel,"dude, no its not at all. If you don't think players look where defenders gaze is when their reading the defense, you are an idiot. "
humanhighlightreel,so does DeAndre Jordan. if you are a dominant rebounder boxing out is not always the best thing. 
humanhighlightreel,"Prior to the 3 point line, league AVG ORTG was 99.0. In 2000, it was 104.1. Now it is 105.6."
humanhighlightreel,But LeBron is better at basketball than Kobe was.
humanhighlightreel,"Not necessarily. As he used an implied subject, we don't know if he is saying ""I could be biased"" or ""this could be bias"" (as in it could be the noun ""bias"" influencing his opinion). I suspect that is what he was doing. "
humanhighlightreel,That is the least interesting anecdote on all of twitter. 
humanhighlightreel,how is it obvious that Jackson turned him into the playmaker he is?
humanhighlightreel,Seth doe
humanhighlightreel,"Prime as in ~3-5 year stretch? Wade for sure. 

Prime as in best year? I might have to go with 03 TMac, but 09 Wade was right in line with him. Two of the greatest non-MVP seasons ever (arguably *the* two greatest, other than the ones where people got tired of voting for MJ). "
humanhighlightreel,"Dude. You don't understand. Let me ELY5. Try not to be too stubborn here, because what I am telling you is not my opinion, it is fact:

Since every extra possession that you squeeze into a game means an extra possession for your opponent, the *only* goal of basketball is to average more points *per possession* than your opponent. The only exception is 2-for-1's at the end of quarters, but these are not considered in per 100 stats. 

Playing faster doesn't give you any extra edge unless you are more efficient with your possessions as a result of it. **The Warriors are more efficient as a result of it, and I am not arguing that**.

However, we are arguing the merits of per 100 possession stats vs. per 36. Per 100 stats *do* give Curry credit for *the extra offensive efficiency* (or points per possession) generated as a result of his team thriving in a fast environment. They score on a higher % of their possessions because they get out ahead and tire out their opponent, which is reflected in higher points, assists, etc per 100, and higher %'s. 

There is literally no downside to per 100 stats. 

&gt;And as for my sucking in math, allow me to be the first to say that efficiency stats are overrated in the NBA. I can't even count the number of championships that went against the numbers in the past decade (and just prior to the last decade we had the magnificent one by Detroit who against all numbers crushed the Shaq/Kobe Lakers).

This doesn't make any sense whatsoever. If we are talking about team efficiency stats, they are literally just a descriptive stat telling you exactly what is happening on the court. What numbers are you saying those chips went against? The Pistons had a higher pace-adjusted margin of victory than the Lakers all season. That was right in line with the numbers. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"He was (is) really, really good. People accurately predicted his defensive impact, and he could have been a great offensive player had he not shattered his elbow. He had a nice midrange game developing, a ton of cool in-between moves, and was (still is) a great passer. Unfortunately that injury really hurt his shot / finishing ability. "
humanhighlightreel,"AD would absolutely be fine with DJ, he has enough range on his jumper than spacing would be OK, and defensively AD is really versatile.

But its still not maximizing their individual potential. I would be drooling over DJ and Dirk, where he could make up for Dirk's deficiency (rim protection) while Dirk gives him room for unstoppable pick and rolls.

Or I would be drooling over AD and Horford, where Horford could bang in the post against teams with true C's, but is versatile enough to keep AD near the rim as often as possible. And on offense Horford could actually pass the ball for some high-low stuff, as give AD space with his money midrange game. 

So year, AD and DJ would work, but I wouldn't be drooling over it as it is not the most efficient use of either's skillsets. At the end of the day, with DJ you are better off putting your assets towards perimeter oriented players, because he screws up spacing so much in the paint. "
humanhighlightreel,The Warriors also didn't play their starters in most 4th quarters in the regular season
humanhighlightreel,exactly. what draymond is doing is called learning.
humanhighlightreel,"To be fair, a lot of that had to do with the uncertainty surrounding Conley"
humanhighlightreel,I think its probably that. Bo was huge. Michael made Nike. 
humanhighlightreel,He is absolutely a weak FT shooter compared to his shooting ability everywhere else on the floor
humanhighlightreel,for what? what alt account?
humanhighlightreel,I appreciate your unabashed homerism. Fuck the haters. Do you. 
humanhighlightreel,at work whats the video
humanhighlightreel,he will start his own company. no way he does anything else. 
humanhighlightreel,"What does this mean, do you mean if people didn't foul him and those layups became open? They would be about the same, as he would probably shoot close to 90% on the pretty open layups. 

Harden flops, sure, but its not like *most* of his fouls are bullshit. He is legitimately good at drawing contact. "
humanhighlightreel,pooping on the court
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;Partly because missed shots where you draw a foul don't count against your FG%.

That has nothing to do with my comment. 

&gt;Most of the time he is just flailing his arms around trying to get a foul call instead of actually shooting the ball.

Who cares? It works in the regular season and has worked even better in the playoffs, this season included. I would understand the criticism if he wasn't able to make shots other than at the line, but he is efficient from all over the floor. "
humanhighlightreel,"There are no rules against it. 

It could never, ever in a million years happen, but there are no rules against it. 

People made comments about Britney Griner doing it a few years ago, but in reality she would be the worst player on most D3 teams. "
humanhighlightreel,"He certainly would have made it interesting. Wiggins looks like a future star, don't get me wrong, but he didn't have a very good statistical ROY campaign. Jabari was playing better than him when he got hurt. Sure, Wiggins improved drastically shortly thereafter, but some improvement could be expected from Parker too. 

Even if you look at their rate/advanced stats for the season, where Jabari didn't even get a chance to improve, you could still make an argument for him. I'm not married to any of these stats, but he had a higher WS/48, PER and BPM. "
humanhighlightreel,Except that's a cumulative score and he has the most attempts
humanhighlightreel,"The lack of spacing Love provides certainly will help the Dubs a lot. It makes it a lot easier to keep him away from the rim, which will be huge if LeBron's jumper is still missing in action. "
humanhighlightreel,"I mean it's not proof, but it's fairly convincing evidence. There are only a few cases where there is a ASG starter that was worse than guys who didn't make the team and they all involve Kobe and Yao. "
humanhighlightreel,Its equally unlikely that a female guard could compete in the NBA. The chances of both are exactly 0.0%. 
humanhighlightreel,"They will probably never play on team USA together even. 

"
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, but it would be impossible for the Rockets to match 1.048 without transition opportunities. "
humanhighlightreel,me too. never seen a sports documentary capture the real tangible connection between sports and the real world better. 
humanhighlightreel,Longley was an awesome passer. Really skilled player. Not the most athletic though.
humanhighlightreel,"with 1/250,000,000 the cash"
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;I just hate smartass comments like ""But being a more complete player, and being capable of more is not the same thing as doing more - and that matters."" Wtf is that lol.

It means that he has the tools - atheticism, shooting, finishing, court vision, defense - to be the greatest player of all time but he has struggled to maximize his tools because of a a major flaws in his game. His decisiveness. 

That is the main reason for his turnovers, in my opinion. As I said, he is constantly giving the defense time to prepare. He has this notion that he can gain an advantage by waiting and reading, but as a former NCAA player myself I can tell you that it is never the case - time always helps the defense more than the offense no matter how smart you are. It also results in a lot of the long 2's and pull up 3's that are hurting his game right now, as 2015 defenses are well versed in cutting off penetration if you give them time. 

I understand that playing at a fast pace and decisively is something that comes with familiarity with teammates and good coaching. But LeBron can still do better because he is that good. Watch him closely coming off screens at the top of the key and see how many good opportunities he dribbles out of - it happens far too often. 

None of this is really a slight on LeBron. He is still the best player in the league and the second best player ever. Often in these situations, especially in the clutch, he has bailed himself out because of his uncanny ability to always get a good shot and his respectable touch. But if it took him less time to be comfortable enough to not over-think the game, he would be slightly better. And there is no reason *not* to talk about ways someone could improve just because they are great. "
humanhighlightreel,"If they had Lillard, healthy Roy, Batum, Aldridge, and healthy Oden, with healthy Wes off the bench.... they would be a dynasty. 

That said, they wouldn't have all those things if those players had stayed healthy. 

Still, can someone make that team for me in 2k?

Even if just Oden and Roy stayed healthy they could have won championship(s) I think. Oden was really a special player. "
humanhighlightreel,"No, because Blake does that stuff all the time. There is a usage/efficiency curve on plays like that.

Dude can execute in most situations, he just doesn't have much game. He can't create for himself or others well "
humanhighlightreel,"true. that's funny it would have been way better if C-Webb was involved. 

not really any other way to spin the timeout situation though. he dun goofed."
humanhighlightreel,"When JJ plays your spacing is great, but that is 14 minutes a game and you give up a ton on defense in that lineup. Doubt he will play much against the Dubs as there is nowhere to hide him. Dray would punish him in the post. "
humanhighlightreel,....What about Larry Bird? Also Karl Malone is not that close. 
humanhighlightreel,"That is also fair, but you could argue his lack of aggression on offense is related to his increased workload defense. Even if he is using more possessions, he is taking a ridiculous amount of long 2's, mostly of the stepback variety, and that shot is a relatively low-energy possession. I believe it is in part due to lack of familiarity and decisiveness (in addition to spacing), but perhaps fatigue is a big factor as well. Either way, he would be well suited to cut his minutes, take some lesser assignments on D, and be more aggressive on offense. I get that what he is doing is working right now, but let's be honest - this is the East. "
humanhighlightreel,"How so? Barkley was a fantastic defender considering his disadvantages. To be even mediocre at the 4 at his height is incredibly impressive. He had the athleticism, bulk and arm length to be the best defender in history if he was 7'1"". "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;thoughts?

James Worthy wore that number well. "
humanhighlightreel,"because he still wouldn't be eligable, because he played pro before he got there. "
humanhighlightreel,JR over Shump. The more spacing you have around LeBron the better. Better to use Shump as much as possible when LeBron sits. 
humanhighlightreel,"Its 6% on an additional 2 attempts a game, but even that understates the difference in scoring efficiency. Beal outscored Korver by 2.8 points per 36 but was using an extra 7 possessions a game, its really a massive difference. Korver could have jacked an additional 7 threes a game and only would have had to hit one of them to be a higher volume *and* more efficient scorer than Beal. Its also worth noting that Korver is a better rebounder and probably better defender too. 

But its not really about the shooting - its more about the gravity. Korver attracts a ridiculous amount of attention because his shooting is just that much better than anyone else in the league's. Its why he was 11th in the league in RPM (Beal was 61) and and 35th in BPM (Beal was 123). "
humanhighlightreel,So they are making french films
humanhighlightreel,"The 2013 Heat were ABSOLUTELY known for shooting 3's, and they shot them more than either of the teams you mentioned. 

I don't think a team has ever existed in the NBA that meets your definition of 3 point oriented, so I guess you're right - by that definition there has never been a 3 point oriented contender. "
humanhighlightreel,"I am a Bills season ticket holder. I care about OJ. 

I actually think he just misinterpreted what I meant; he was pointing to Docs that use sports as a vehicle to tell a story about the real world. 

I was referring to how Once Brothers uses real world events to tell a story about teammates - and vice versa. Its more of a 2-way street, which is what I find compelling. June 17, 1994 isn't really a sports story at all. "
humanhighlightreel,"the fuck you talking about. he is 23. yeah obviously he is more high profile, but you talking as if being injured in his first ever playoff run is gonna hurt his HOF chances. yeah, if he gets a ring people will say LeBron got it for him - but (a) that would have been the case anyway and (b) there is no chance they get a ring unless he makes a miraculous recovery. "
humanhighlightreel,"I don't know why anyone is saying Houston. They already have a top 3 PG in James Harden. People just don't like to call him one because he is 6'5"" and it makes more sense to put him beside another fast guy who can shoot. "
humanhighlightreel,"No, but it's is a team of all Finals rookies. That is what I said. "
humanhighlightreel,"I am sure he will realize that pairing is pretty good. The problem is, that the league is always evolving. There will be another adjustment that he needs to make next year, and he will be 4 months late on that one too. He is a reactionary coach, who listens to what the media/public is saying just in time to save his job. A good coach makes adjustments the public doesn't even know are necessary. 

At the end of the day, Wittman is being praised for the fact that the Wiz are finally playing well. But they are playing well because of some pretty *obvious* adjustments (as well as some great individual efforts). In my opinion, you guys have the second best starting lineup in the league (and a couple decent bench guys), and you have a lot of roster continuity. You guys could have won the East this year. The way Wittman has you playing should be considered meeting expectations, not beating them. And when your peak is meeting expectations, its time to go. "
humanhighlightreel,He was about exactly as good as he is now. 
humanhighlightreel,Watch 96 Sonics games on Youtube. 
humanhighlightreel,Overlord of the Boards
humanhighlightreel,"You have no idea, nor do I. He was playing in China, even if you watched every game its impossible to compare the competition. 

Teams won't make that decision until workouts. 

Personally, I think Russell is a future star. Mudiay might be too, but you can't be as sure. "
humanhighlightreel,What?
humanhighlightreel,"OK, Dave. "
humanhighlightreel,"To each their own.

Although that also means you would rather LMA than CP3, which is pretty crazy IMO. "
humanhighlightreel,"I would actually say Okafor's dribble drive game is much better than Duncan's. In fact, it is probably the best I have ever seen for a C. Its truly remarkable what a good ball-handler Okafor is, and by far the most overlooked part of his game.

Defense, you are right. There is no comparison. Though I do believe with his size, strength, arm length and hand size, he could be well above average once he learns the nuances of the game. 

"
humanhighlightreel,The Hawks deserve the city of Atlanta? I guess...
humanhighlightreel,"how has this thread not been deleted? just because he added ""which teams do you want to see lose?"""
humanhighlightreel,....it was a lucky bucket. How does that restore your faith?
humanhighlightreel,"Wow, that was terrible. Not every player in NBA history came through the draft, and those numbers are out of the blue. 

See this:

From the time the draft went to 2 rounds (1989) to 2010 (last five drafts will still have more first time all stars) that is how many players have been drafted to the NBA. Of those players, 10.25% have gone on to make an ASG. 

Using that figure, we can determine that when picking a 60 NBA players, there is a 0.15% chance that 0 will be All stars. 0.15%! I could give you 500:1 odds that there will be an All Star in the next draft, and it would be me making the smart bet. 

You were not being nitpicky in order to be careful or not make unfair assumptions. You were being nitpicky to be a dick (either that or you have very little intuition when it comes to probability). "
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah, but neither of those are clutch. "
humanhighlightreel,what is cmv
humanhighlightreel,"I said around average, could be a little higher could be a little lower. 

The Cavs without LeBron would probably be around NBA average.

The Rockets without Harden would probably be around NBA average

The Warriors without Steph would still probably be above average by SRS/PD, but would probably have been the 8-seed at best in the west. "
humanhighlightreel,"Dude Russ played 566 straight games (not including AAU, which he also never missed) from HS till his 5th year in the league before one injury that has caused him to miss significant time for stretches. He is probably the least injury prone player in the league after LeBron. Guy is built like a brick house - if anyone could be healthy at 7'1 it's him. "
humanhighlightreel,"Keep in mind that Curry basically didn't play 4th quarters this year. Per 36 he was 26.2/4.7/8.5 to Paul's 21.4/5.2/10.3, and Curry as you said was more efficient with 64% TS to Paul's 60%. Those seasons are pretty similar if you ask me. 

What sets Curry apart to me is his off ball gravity and the fact that he doesn't need to dominate the ball nearly to the extent Paul has his whole career. This year, Paul had the ball 22.3% of the time he was on the court, right in line with Westbrook and Wall near the top of the league (Jennings and Rubio were the only starting PGs higher). **Curry had the ball only 15.6% of the time - less than every other starting PG in the league.**

This is the phenomenon that people on here don't understand about Curry's season, and why his counting stats don't quite live up to his historic +/- ones. All the other guards (+LBJ) to put up insane stats had the ball so much more than him. They were basically holding the ball trying to create a look for either themselves or their teammates - that typically results in really high assist #'s and scoring totals. More impressive than Curry's efficiency with his shots is his efficiency with time - all that extra time that he doesn't have the ball someone else does and is making something happen. 

The fact that he put up the numbers he did while playing within an offense, not dominating it, is simply mind-blowing. "
humanhighlightreel,"no its not. doesn't even matter, it is HQ and not an instant post / karma grab"
humanhighlightreel,"nope, nobody in the 70s either"
humanhighlightreel,"James' was 10x more impressive, because the ball went int the direction he was aiming. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yes. 7x All Star is usually the cutoff for being automatic, and he was a particularly good 7x AS, as a 2x DPOY and a guy who would have made more were it not for injuries and kidney disease. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;this seems to be a very american way of thinking about it

Actually, this is the complete opposite. America is considered a melting pot society, where after immigration one becomes American and is expected to champion American culture. I, as a Canadian, do not think that way. I see no reason to force every person to label themselves under one flag.

Manu is absolutely Argentine, but he is also Italian. There is no debate here, he is a citizen of Italy and chose to move back there for a reason. Does he identify more as Argentine than Italian? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean he doesn't identify as both. "
humanhighlightreel,recency bias bias
humanhighlightreel,... hardcore fans want it changed too. Its an illogical rule. 
humanhighlightreel,"That actually makes a lot of sense. It is the ball handler who was the biggest threat to score at the time of the foul, so their accuracy is most relevant. 

I like it. "
humanhighlightreel,yeah that was definitely his strategy. 
humanhighlightreel,"So? 12th in FG per game is a lot. Yeah, getting to the line is a huge part of his game, but he is a great scorer all around. Besides, he is getting to the line even more in the playoffs. "
humanhighlightreel,"Can't stand when people criticize Barkley for this. Manu *is* European. He is ethnically Italian, an Italian citizen and has lived in Italy. He is also Argentinian as he was born there and is an Argentinian citizen.

"
humanhighlightreel,"Because Ray left while the Celts squad was still together, and he left for their main rival. 

Not saying its fair, but those are the main reasons. "
humanhighlightreel,"I would never say never, but its highly unlikely. The game was in its infancy at that stage - it was rough enough around the edges that a freak athlete giant could come in and play with veterans. Everyone is so good now that it takes at least a year for even the most gifted athletes to refine their games enough to contribute positively, let alone more positively than anyone in the league. 

Still though, you never know. "
humanhighlightreel,"I agree, but I think 30 games is certainly enough "
humanhighlightreel,"You can check my post history and will not find a single instance of me saying that Aldridge is anywhere close. 

Aldridge is a one-dimensional scorer who never looks to pass out of the double team, and as a result is not efficient at all. I would take Blake, Love and Duncan over him in a heartbeat at the PF. He is simply the most overrated player in the NBA. "
humanhighlightreel,"everyone talks about his supposed midrange game but he hasn't used it enough to be believable. in the NBA open midrange Js don't just come along, you need to find them and have a quick release. he didn't even do that consistently in college."
humanhighlightreel,no we don't. he is a very good role player who excels in transition and is deadly when he gets hot. we all know this and appreciate him as such. 
humanhighlightreel,the trash bros
humanhighlightreel,"Part of it stems from the fact that the Bulls had already won when Rose got hurt. At the end of the day, he is too intense and he overworks his players. He thinks the regular season is a little too important. 

That said, those traits come with the territory when you are dealing with a personality like his, and the good outweighs the bad. The extra minutes probably make a minor difference when it comes to injuries. "
humanhighlightreel,"Definitely not Kobe. He got the Pacers (6th in the league by SRS), Sixers (7th), Nets (5th) and Magic (4th), all relatively week Finals teams. Magic at 4th were not nearly designed to win a chip either. Other than the Celts his series were pretty easy. 

But his conference Finals matchups? They more than make up for it. Spurs, Kings, Suns - all crazy good teams. 
"
humanhighlightreel,"Larry is not over 6'9""."
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah and that was a pretty big issue for spacing in college. The defense made up for it, but it wouldn't work in the NBA. 

Stanley has a robotic jumper that falls a decent amount when he is open. He creates little to no gravity on the perimeter. Further, his off the bounce game is mediocre unless he is out-muscling his opponent, which he won't be able to do as often in the NBA. "
humanhighlightreel,"Because that is influenced by way too many other factors, such as coaches, teammates, opponents, etc. If you are that GM you are obviously going to take the guy you feel is most capable of accomplishing the most. The guy who accomplished the most isn't necessarily the same answer. 

The hypothetical GM approach considers dominance, and longevity, but tries to control for all the shit that makes these questions so complicated. "
humanhighlightreel,They will all be up for new deals eventually though. Its a legitimate question. 
humanhighlightreel,"The NBA is much more system oriented than it used to be. Literally the opposite of what you are asking is true. 

There have always been offenses that rely on systems (SSOL, Triangle), but in today's NBA ball movement is so important to overcome Thibsian (not 100% his, but the paint-packing style he helped champion) defenses, that teams who don't execute complex, adaptable systems are fucked. The Thunder are the only team really to succeed without one in recent years, whereas in the 00's there were lots of teams that were built around 1v1 gunners. 

I do think scripted plays are slightly less common, but that is a sign of systems becoming more complex, not less so. "
humanhighlightreel,"Yes, it would. Blake is younger and way better than LMA"
humanhighlightreel,"Is it really that easy to edit a major page on Wiki? 

Someone see if you can make him play for the Columbus Bluejackets or Bayern Munich"
humanhighlightreel,"It doesn't inflate his FG% because he was fouled and gets to the line. If he tries to get fouled and fails, his FG% would drop."
humanhighlightreel,"Yes it is. Kevin Love would be right back at it, and between him Kyrie and a good D they would be a pretty good team. "
humanhighlightreel,"Likely because PER is a better indicator of athleticism than value. Players who grab a high % of rebounds rather than box out, and gunners rather than shooters / players who play within a system have inflated PERs. 

Not sure why you would waste your time on a study like this, and choose to use an antiquated statistic. "
humanhighlightreel,"That's not all you need to say at all. (a) the Heat were in the East, which means large stretches of easy games and (b) the Dubs had a 16 game and a 12 gamer themselves. 

They also had a vastly greater PD and SRS, and they didn't even play 4th quarters. A win streak is more about luck and randomness than anything else."
humanhighlightreel,"dude

how dis dude got 3 upvotes Payton is not gonna be top 5 in three years or in 5 years"
humanhighlightreel,nope. its impossible.
humanhighlightreel,"Oh, they were definitely legitimate contenders this year, as were the Clippers, though the Warriors were probably coming out of the West no matter what. But every year you get closer to Duncan retiring. Sure, if they can't get Aldridge it might make sense to get Millsap for one last run, but if they can they can lay the foundation for the next era of Spurs basketball. That is why the Aldridge story is much more meaningful. "
humanhighlightreel,"Size, strength, speed, agility, coordination to name a few"
humanhighlightreel,"Outside of Kings/Lakers, Timmy's tech for laughing was pretty ridiculous. "
humanhighlightreel,"I have never understood why so often on this sub people drool over teams pairing redundant skill sets. There are diminishing returns when you pair two guys like that on defense, as both are at their best near the basket (Davis was away from it way too much under Williams). On offense, when already have a rim protector on the floor, why not add other skillsets? "
humanhighlightreel,I agree. Everyone gets lucky. Just saying it's not clutch. 
humanhighlightreel,"I was really intrigued by this post before clicking because I thought you had analysed it.

Now I know you're just shit. "
humanhighlightreel,"100% agree. I consider myself a very objective NBA fan, and even I have a hard time remembering good Crash lol "
humanhighlightreel,"1. Why would it have to be intentional only? There is logic in the rule anyway. I think it makes sense for all off-ball fouls in the bonus. 

2. They already judge intentional fouls in the last 2 minutes and it works pretty well. "
humanhighlightreel,"I didn't say good. I said *that* good, which implies I am speaking in relative terms. Compared to the 2015 Warriors, they were not *that* good in my opinion. "
humanhighlightreel,"I agree solid was an understatement. He is a top 10 defender for sure, maybe top 5. I just think that you can form a top 5 defense with this Cavs roster anyway, and there are diminishing returns there. With Ibaka you really only have 2 creative offensive players on the court. 

At the end of the day, I belong to the club of guys who think a great individual offensive player is more valuable than a great defensive player, because an individual can influence the offense more that the defense other than if you are a true C (""team D"" is more important than any other player). 

I understand why many people will disagree though. "
humanhighlightreel,"He has a fantastic mid range game, he just rarely had to use it in college. He was money from 15 feet. 

And he doesn't just use his strength and post moves - that is a tired narrative. His face-up game is dominant because he is such a good ball-handler, and he is a great passer too. True C's won't be able to guard him out of the triple threat. "
humanhighlightreel,Some people are naturally better at them than others. 
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah. It was a toxic relationship with the team. As I said, not saying its fair. "
humanhighlightreel,Yeah. Sadly we are France
humanhighlightreel,Yes fucking way. 
humanhighlightreel,such is the nature of the NBA. you keep collecting assets so you can take another shot on a superstar. every move involves significant risk. 
humanhighlightreel,what? why?
humanhighlightreel,Thanks!
humanhighlightreel,"I mean, we had Bosh who was a very similar player to LMA. It was understandable. 

As lucky as we were to have the top pick, that was a terrible year to have it, especially for us. "
humanhighlightreel,"in college, yes. by far. Embiid is mostly potential. "
humanhighlightreel,"your mom's a roller coast everybody gets a ride

GOTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEM"
humanhighlightreel,"No way you take Irving, Wall or Kawhi over him IMO.

George you could *consider* before his injury, but even if he lost a quarter step no way. "
humanhighlightreel,"&gt;3point shooting teams dont do well in the playoffs. They run out of gas and then panic while nosediving their way out of the playoffs.

That's simply not true. The Heat were 3rd in 3 pointers in 2013. The Mavs were 5th in 2011. The Celtics were 5th in 2008. Spurs were 4th in 2007. The last team to win the ship while being below avg in 3s was the Pistons in 04. "
humanhighlightreel,"I just mean I can't count that high. I would definitely make a mistake somewhere in the millions. 

EDIT: Just to be a dick though, I will point out that there are many countries where soccer isn't the number 1 sport, including Canada and Finland (Hockey), Australia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, UAE, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka (Cricket), Estonia and Austria (skiing), Latvia and Poland (Basketball), China (Ping Pong), New Zealand and Papau New Guinnea (Rugby), Cambodia and Laos (Kickboxing), Mongolia (Wrestling), Japan, Taiwan, Venezuela, Panama, Nicaragua, Cuba, Dominican Republic (Baseball) and Bhutan (Archery) "
humanhighlightreel,"Which is crazy because Cuse D is always so good. But I guess the guards just never learn man-to-man properly because of his zone.

Jerami Grant will be the redemption though. I think he has a really promising career as a stopper, even though he went 2nd round. "
humanhighlightreel,Except that's not even the case. The Clips give up a lot of shots at the rim. 
humanhighlightreel,"I like this a lot.  I was thinking about doing the same, but was actually mostly interested in the 60's- 80s. "
humanhighlightreel,oh absolutely. he can score from anywhere. 
humanhighlightreel,"OK, but they could still win by playing the game of African Tree Hockey. "
humanhighlightreel,he is in real life too
humanhighlightreel,"Yeah I mean Blake is a lot better offensively than Kemp now. Maybe the first year of CP3/Blake.

But Detlef Schrempf was my naginta"
humanhighlightreel,You're fucking kidding me right?  LeBron James isn't even that much better of a defender than Melo anymore during the regular season. So you basically think Melo is better than LeBron in the regular season. 
humanhighlightreel,"&gt; Also you should edit zero allstars at the end of your sentence. It's technically better writing.

You are wrong, and now I hate you. "
humanhighlightreel,"JR Smith bro. The Young Money tat is awesome. 

[Monta Ellis'](http://vlsportysexycool.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Monta-Ellis-SSC.jpg) ""Family Tree"" is also awesome in the ugliest kind of way. "
humanhighlightreel,"He was 42.3% last year which is pretty good. He is definitely someone you have to guard in the mid range, but I agree he takes too many in that offense. "
humanhighlightreel,And of course the immortal Toni Kukoc
humanhighlightreel,"Most players come into the league with unrefined post games. 

But Cauley-Stein is a rising senior (except the rising part obviously), and not very coordinated. Its not gonna happen for him. "
humanhighlightreel,you can't just learn to shoot FTs. you think Dwight and DeAndre haven't tried?
humanhighlightreel,They affect what gets seen by others
humanhighlightreel,"I agree with all that, except you are vastly overrating LeBron's defense. For a few possessions he can still be elite, but over the course of a game he is far from it (been a lot better this postseason than past, but that explains some of the offensive drop off). 

But being a more complete player, and being capable of more is not the same thing as being better - and that matters. LeBron is a smart player with unbelievable vision, but a common problem throughout his career has been his inability to maximize his abilities at all times. In 2012 and 2013 he made a huge breakthrough, becoming comfortable with his jumper when teams sagged off, and posting when he had mismatches. But he has never consistently been that guy and it holds him back.

This isn't me saying ""LeBron isn't clutch""; I am not Skip Bayless. This is me saying that LeBron constantly does shit like ""sizing up a defense"" which is code for wasting the shot clock when he has an opportunity to make a play. He sees himself as the basketball savant who should read and pick apart the defense - and he can do that quite effectively - but sometimes he just needs to be the beast of an athlete and basketball player he is. The amount of times I have seen him come around a screen with a half step on a defender (which is the equivalent of 2 steps for anyone else) and dribble out instead of making a decisive play is ridiculous. Defenses are so keyed into how to stop LeBron because it is nearly impossible, but he does them a huge favor by letting them prepare. 

I will happily accept my ""you criticized LeBron"" down-votes, but this is really what is holding him back right now. He needs to be decisive and aggressive and let the game come to him. That way he will be ""head-and-shoulders"" the best player in the league again. He is certainly the most gifted and most complete, as you said. "
humanhighlightreel,"I know, but it doesn't change the fact that Jordan beat the GP Sonics, which was a nasty team in the 90s."
humanhighlightreel,From exactly 10 years ago? KG. From 2003-04 to 2004-05 he was the best player alive and incredible to watch. 
humanhighlightreel,LEBRAWWWWN JAMES
humanhighlightreel,"no, because *basketball* is not like boxing. size and ability on not nearly as correlated. "
humanhighlightreel,"Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love, again. "
humanhighlightreel,"Completely agree. He is studying the relationship between market size and attracting FA's though. I was showing the tiers of the *size* of the basketball market, not the attractiveness of the destination. People don't go to MIA because its a big market, they go for the other two reasons. That was my point. A paper stating that ""FAs go to cities they want to live in"" isn't really worth writing unless your name is Magic. "
idealreaddit,clips by 34
idealreaddit,"Warriors will miss, Jazz make instead

Mavs too, OKC will make

Honestly there is 0 chance Mavs make the playoffs next season"
idealreaddit,lol he was worse with the deflated ball
idealreaddit,nothing blind about it
idealreaddit,Chris Paul is not injury prone. Not anymore than Lillard that's for sure
idealreaddit,no your team is definitely fucked.
idealreaddit,"Yea, it was a good trade, especially considering we couldn't have kept him anyway. Unfortunate how Dudley worked out but that doesn't make the trade any worse. "
idealreaddit,we shot 2-15 from 3 and are still very much in this game. we got this shit
idealreaddit,good for you bro im happy for you
idealreaddit,Point is I doubt he's still at 95%
idealreaddit,lol quit bitching
idealreaddit,well someone went through my comment history and downvoted everything so that's part of it lol
idealreaddit,I refuse to believe that
idealreaddit,"Bogut FLOP 

Def not a foul on Dwight

FUCK BOGUT FUCK GOLDEN STATE"
idealreaddit,Let me know when Wall learns how to shoot
idealreaddit,Lol what the fuck curry complains a ton
idealreaddit,"not in the playoffs

6moy is a regular season award"
idealreaddit,LMAO your fans do the same thing bro. I've been to your games I would know
idealreaddit,if he doesn't win then the media robbed him
idealreaddit,"How? the clippers are way more fun to watch than the Rockets, flop less, have much more high character guys, hilarious coach…"
idealreaddit,Thibs isn't a very good coach
idealreaddit,"He was shooting like 60% for the series, had to miss some shots at some point. Also Barnes played good D on him."
idealreaddit,We won't need to because it will be gone next season. 
idealreaddit,no he doesn't he's not a dirty player
idealreaddit,those teams were 8 or 9 players deep. clippers are like 5.5 players deep. not even comparable at all.
idealreaddit,All he cares about is winning
idealreaddit,What? Ok? How is that relevant to the seeding at all?
idealreaddit,"Damn man I didn't want to cry... touching story. Jack seems to be an incredibly strong kid, and Chris is an amazing human being."
idealreaddit,just you and me bud
idealreaddit,Clippers by 9
idealreaddit,Better for sure but this is a really fucking tough question to answer. Don't think we'd be *way* better.
idealreaddit,i dont
idealreaddit,If you're a retard yea
idealreaddit,he has really good handles watch him sometime. or just remain ignorant
idealreaddit,So has everyone else on here. You're not some special snowflake
idealreaddit,"Paul, Butler, Durant, Griffin, Howard

Best or next best at their position. And they would mesh really well"
idealreaddit,Ours is pretty simple
idealreaddit,When did I ever call myself a nice guy
idealreaddit,"If you seriously think a backcourt of a guy under 6 foot and a guy barely over 6 foot would have worked I don't know what to say to you

And that's not even mentioning the contract"
idealreaddit,memphis will continue the trend
idealreaddit,gtfo ku fan
idealreaddit,"Cavs by 1  
Clippers by 29"
idealreaddit,"&gt;I'm pretty sure they will have to blow the team up next season

If you think this then you are an idiot. "
idealreaddit,Best starting 5 in the NBA. 
idealreaddit,"1. CP3  
2. Conley  
3. Wall  
4. Holiday. 
5. Beverley"
idealreaddit,Hawks starting five
idealreaddit,trevor ariza was absolutely huge the last 3 games
idealreaddit,then dont drink soda
idealreaddit,wow 32 blocks
idealreaddit,lol now you sound really mad
idealreaddit,like i said rockets suck dick clips in 5
idealreaddit,or both
idealreaddit,Plus he will just continue to add things to his game and improve what's already there
idealreaddit,curry is such a dumb player. terrible shot
idealreaddit,Clippers last season. 
idealreaddit,none of those things have any possibiliy to happen to the clippers
idealreaddit,lol no they wouldnt
idealreaddit,uh did you not watch your teams first round series
idealreaddit,"Well good thing Marc Gasol isn't considered an elite rim protector considering he allowed 54.2% at the rim

Those stats are a load of crap"
idealreaddit,WTF THAT WAS A FOUL ON DRAY
idealreaddit,no it couldnt
idealreaddit,He put up good stats against the terrible Mavs D but now that he's up against a team that actually knows how to defend him he's struggling more.
idealreaddit,Kidd
idealreaddit,"Well you didn't answer my question. But...

&gt;I would argue that The King is a better PG than CP3 ever was. His passing and ability to read the floor are on another level.

wow"
idealreaddit,Right now he'd be an alright starting PG but probably bottom 5.
idealreaddit,Clutchness
idealreaddit,only because of luck. this season couldnt touch any of cp3's seasons
idealreaddit,Go Clips! Let's finish these guys off
idealreaddit,Because Harden's play style is a turn off to many and Dwight is widely disliked. 
idealreaddit,DJ
idealreaddit,Stop posting these 3PM stats no one gives a shit
idealreaddit,"do you really think we know why he was fired

best guess is the ""testicular fortitude"" comments on dan patrick"
idealreaddit,its bad for you
idealreaddit,They win every game. 
idealreaddit,"There are a lot of reasons it failed. Higher oreb rate for clippers, getting spurs out of rhythm and preventing fastbreak, rest, foul trouble"
idealreaddit,"no they're not wrong, i just find it funny that whenever someone asks about hacking, half the responses are just ""make your free throws""."
idealreaddit,That's because you're a gigantic homer
idealreaddit,a month ago
idealreaddit,we wont lose this
idealreaddit,They have 3 championships. Same as the other 3 remaining combined. 
idealreaddit,\&gt;implying clippers whine anywhere near as much as warriors
idealreaddit,stfu
idealreaddit,I wouldn't
idealreaddit,this is one of the rare occasions that i troll
idealreaddit,Dwight getting held no call
idealreaddit,Not dumb at all. In terms of basketball skill he's definitely the best to ever do it.
idealreaddit,woudlve swept houston with chris paul healthy
idealreaddit,This takes into account less than 5% of the total game. 
idealreaddit,What the fuck
idealreaddit,"I really don't see the argument for Nash being better. Even if he is slightly better on offense, which is debatable considering CP3 is a better scorer, he was never good at all defensively, while CP3 is consistently a the top of his position on that side of the ball."
idealreaddit,"Arguable, but I'd say Tony Allen has a less negative impact on his team offensively than Harden does on his team defensively. "
idealreaddit,"No, it's not insane at all.

Well Kyrie over Melo is ridiculous"
idealreaddit,"So why isn't he doing anything for Grantland/ESPN right now even though his contract isn't up?

He was fired. "
idealreaddit,Whoaaaaa lol why would the Magic ever do that. They have a good young core and a high draft pick and they're going to trade it all away for a 30 year old point guard who wants to contend for a championship *now* and be nowhere near position to contend for one? Absolutely not.
idealreaddit,what a flop kawhi
idealreaddit,LOL this is the dumbest thing I have ever read.
idealreaddit,completely misunderstood the question my b
idealreaddit,"Playing 4 game at home and 3 on the road &gt; 3 at home and 4 on the road, how is that so hard to understand"
idealreaddit,http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DeAndre-Jordan-Face-After-Brandon-Knight-Dunk.gif
idealreaddit,that's irrelevant
idealreaddit,noooooooo
idealreaddit,/r/LAClippers 
idealreaddit,rockets in 6
idealreaddit,fuck mo
idealreaddit,That is unreal
idealreaddit,this. hindsight is 20/20
idealreaddit,stop doing that lebron
idealreaddit,You see me in the game threads right. I watch every game. 
idealreaddit,You (and everyone else in this sub) are underrating CP3's handles.  This sub is made up of casuals who don't watch basketball and are easily won over by flashy plays. Curry and Kyrie cater to that crowd.
idealreaddit,"""why do i never hear anything about blake being a great passing big man"""
idealreaddit,MIK3 CONL3Y
idealreaddit,lmfao
idealreaddit,Taking this in 4 would be huge
idealreaddit,"Everyone else still thinks they're whiny little flopping bitches too, they've just come to realize that they're really fucking good at basketball.

You can hate a team and still respect how good they are. Those two things are not mutually exclusive."
idealreaddit,"Hawks have severely underwhelmed

Raps were just awful. Mavs too"
idealreaddit,"Ur bench sucks fat dicks compared to Spurs though, Clippers in 4"
idealreaddit,And rockets are 6th best
idealreaddit,this is why chris paul is the best offensive player in the nba
idealreaddit,That's what you said about the Spurs
idealreaddit,19/4/3 on 39%
idealreaddit,It's the regular season it really doesn't have much bearing on the playoffs
idealreaddit,yo the title run is still on
idealreaddit,Yea i did and it was bullshit
idealreaddit,josh smith makes no fucking sense
idealreaddit,Who'd the Cavs have? Kyrie?
idealreaddit,according to the officiating harden has taken more than twice as much contact in this game as blake. absolute farce
idealreaddit,nice bro
idealreaddit,Not if u go to jail
idealreaddit,Thank god
idealreaddit,what?
idealreaddit,you're a pussy
idealreaddit,I'm not being defensive if someone says something patently false about me I'm going to call them out on it. 
idealreaddit,No they aren't. 
idealreaddit,/r/NBA would love this guy
idealreaddit,Well you just wrote a big paragraph of absolutely no substance at all. So props to you. 
idealreaddit,Cuz they mad
idealreaddit,What specifically is untrue
idealreaddit,mines fine
idealreaddit,NICE
idealreaddit,Clippers
idealreaddit,I believe him over Wall 
idealreaddit,Or Rockets
idealreaddit,curry is such a chucker
idealreaddit,"yes, he did, but harden also had a huge flop"
idealreaddit,i'll bet my next paycheck
idealreaddit,Wtf was that Noah
idealreaddit,ad because blake plays with cp3
idealreaddit,Lol guess we'll see (maybe). Nets went 4-0 in the reg season against Heat last season. Didn't turn out well for them in the playoffs. 
idealreaddit,2nd most entertaining
idealreaddit,lol true...ugh
idealreaddit,wow he got tripped
idealreaddit,Dumb
idealreaddit,Refs are absolutely fucking the Hawks. Shameless
idealreaddit,overtime sample size being a single OT
idealreaddit,He's really not a good shooter
idealreaddit,He's definitely not easily the better defender
idealreaddit,who the hell is johnson
idealreaddit,chuck is such a hater
idealreaddit,how does it feel to be wrong
idealreaddit,"not hating because i love what you're doing, just saying you're as full of shit as /u/thesportsguy11 "
idealreaddit,"I don't think the clippers give a shit about their ""image"""
idealreaddit,You play him if he's ready to play. You don't play him if he's not ready to play
idealreaddit,Serge Ibaka
idealreaddit,Not necessarily
idealreaddit,warriors getting the benefit of the whistle
idealreaddit,Then you'd be wrong
idealreaddit,I don't see how lebrons was any better than cp3's
idealreaddit,There's no such thing as momentum from one game to another in a series. 
idealreaddit,Stephen Curry
idealreaddit,wow what a bitch move by curry
idealreaddit,Really? I thought for sure he was booed
idealreaddit,"I don't usually downvote, but if any comment is worthy of a downvote it's this one."
idealreaddit,If it was just Blake out and CP3 was healthy? Yea. If both were out? Fuck no. 
idealreaddit,I think their roster is complete shit outside of the bigs and don't see them being any good for a long time unless Embiid is literally Hakeem
idealreaddit,no
idealreaddit,let me know when warriors beat the defending champs
idealreaddit,"Harden

wrong answer i guess"
idealreaddit,He didn't really have a monster season tho except for his passing which was historically great.
idealreaddit,terrible call. flop
idealreaddit,"Beal isn't as good of a shooter as Chris Paul. Especially from midrange. Beal shoots 43% from 2P, Chris shoots 52%"
idealreaddit,you following him around is pathetic...not as pathetic as what he did but still pathetic
idealreaddit,fuck harden
idealreaddit,i've got no money to lay down
idealreaddit,Hawks
idealreaddit,Blake can definitely play point
idealreaddit,lol curry missed layup
idealreaddit,"Lol is that so? Except curry was outplayed in every game against the clippers this season, but he has a better bench"
idealreaddit,he always puts up such crazy advanced stats i dont get it
idealreaddit,No he was not. 
idealreaddit,Yes from the Clippers
idealreaddit,We went from title faves (by some sources) to another second round exit
idealreaddit,Damn why couldn't we get this josh smith
idealreaddit,If Chris Paul was on the Warriors the same could be said for him. Curry is lucky to have a great roster around him. Terrible argument. 
idealreaddit,yo the walking dead is good as fuck
idealreaddit,"hes a good defender, but plays magnificent D on harden because he doesn't foul him"
idealreaddit,"cp3 can do that shit too, james"
idealreaddit,oh my god...am i as annoying as this guy when i troll? i hope not
idealreaddit,uhhhhhhhh you know the exact same can be said for warriors? and you beat the lowly pels?
idealreaddit,cp3 will be the top mvp candidate left
idealreaddit,wow didn't know duncan was a flopper
idealreaddit,huh?
idealreaddit,"ive always found these kinds of comments pathetic. the fact that someone took all these screens and cropped them saved them up just for an occasion like this just so they can make themselves look smart.

hindsight is 20/20. he's not some genius for compiling these and those people he screenshotted are not idiots for having those opinions, because, at the time, that was a reasonable opinion to have given the information that was available to them."
idealreaddit,Wow take off your homer goggles. That is the most biased comment I've ever read. 
idealreaddit,wrong
idealreaddit,Nope. 56 GP
idealreaddit,too small. i do like him though
idealreaddit,demarre carroll 
idealreaddit,"Jamal Crawford

Worth: next to nothing"
idealreaddit,Why would they want Rose…
idealreaddit,"unibrow is a power forward

wouldn't take the other two over dwight"
idealreaddit,He's not as good as people thought he was…sucked in Denver too this season. 
idealreaddit,bout to win 0 this time
idealreaddit,nice start
idealreaddit,dang
idealreaddit,"Yea that's true, if the Clippers had Ballmer instead of Sterling Gentry wouldn't be in Oakland right now. "
idealreaddit,choker
idealreaddit,hope your team the worst
idealreaddit,you got 10 FTs what are you complaining about
idealreaddit,"""flopper""? do you people realize you have james harden and corey brewer on your team"
idealreaddit,Yea I don't see how it's a competition. They both are heavily reliant on getting to the free throw line but at least Harden is efficient from the field
idealreaddit,Easily. 
idealreaddit,chris paul is the opposite of soft. do you realize what you're saying?
idealreaddit,in the playoffs
idealreaddit,Udoh
idealreaddit,Clippers win either way Blake will just put up another triple double
idealreaddit,Dude Davis's defense is not that good. And Blake plays good D when he tries. 
idealreaddit,I guarantee I watch more clippers games than you do
idealreaddit,god i hate those fouls. duncan does so much of that bs
idealreaddit,wtf blake
idealreaddit,I don't give a shit what you think
idealreaddit,nonetheless there's no way he was as good as chris paul
idealreaddit,Yea it's not like they were 6th in defense this year or anything
idealreaddit,Clippers finally find their 3pt shot and win by 9. 
idealreaddit,no second round pick either
idealreaddit,wow barnes
idealreaddit,He shoots under 38% from midrange but the rest is fair I guess
idealreaddit,Bill Kennedy was the real problem for us in that game
idealreaddit,i would love to see kyrie go off again tonight like that game against the spurs
idealreaddit,never said they're bad
idealreaddit,too old/inconsistent on his 3pt shot
idealreaddit,"Because the Rockets have no one to stop Blake, DJ can cancel out Dwight, and Harden struggles against Doc's double teams."
idealreaddit,they will be gone. it kills the entertainment value of the game
idealreaddit,i love nic cage and i love reggie miller
idealreaddit,lol continue to feel sorry for yourself
idealreaddit,Clippers are dominating Rockets.
idealreaddit,Also incredible
idealreaddit,I doubt it. I don't see that going up and he's already behind
idealreaddit,67%
idealreaddit,lol alright bro
idealreaddit,Lmao I said it just like the go fox chant without realizing it
idealreaddit,yup and its all his fault
idealreaddit,And 5 assists. On 56% from the field
idealreaddit,"Harden always has a tough time than the Clippers though, historically they are his toughest matchup and that continued this season for the most part. "
idealreaddit,"how do i feel about game 7 in texas

good. the team is pissed as fuck. they will come out angry as fuck and they will not lose.

am i really getting downvoted because the team i am a fan of lost? ridiculous"
idealreaddit,Such a beautiful man
idealreaddit,oh no im embarrassing myself on reddit
idealreaddit,Harden flopped his ass off there's no doubt about it. 2nd one was a basketball play. 
idealreaddit,Matt reached a shit ton in game 2 and Harden got a ton of free throws. He fixed that last night
idealreaddit,Go Cavs
idealreaddit,Because he's a choker
idealreaddit,What? Their roster is very good. Their starting five is *extremely* solid and they are very deep. And you can credit thibs for that. But he's take them as far as they can go. 
idealreaddit,Russ's defense was complete shit
idealreaddit,late whistle after missed shot
idealreaddit,BIG BABY TAKES CHARGES LIKE A MAN
idealreaddit,grizzlies gonna win this series. warriors are a regular season team
idealreaddit,Kevin Durant it's not close at all
idealreaddit,"If we're talking just playoffs, Conley has been better than Marc, who has been absolutely abysmal scoring the basketball.

Rose and Butler are pretty much even

Teague has been bad yea, but pretty much everyone on the Hawks has. He was their best player in the regular season in my opinion."
idealreaddit,Clips still win
idealreaddit,"You can make an argument sure but it's not a huge snub. It's not ""disrespect""."
idealreaddit,Just stating my opinion and contributing positively to the thread by answering OP's question. While you are here commenting on my posting behaviors which is completely irrelevant to OP's question. 
idealreaddit,false
idealreaddit,"It's not like Wall is an amazing scorer though. People are jumping on the Wall train because the Wiz are doing well in the playoffs, but in the first round against the Raptors' awful defense he averaged 17 points on 39/27 shooting....that's not good."
idealreaddit,"PG, SG"
idealreaddit,Give the players rest
idealreaddit,"Paul, Griffin, Jordan, Redick, Rivers, Barnes, Davis, Hawes, and Wilcox."
idealreaddit,us too
idealreaddit,"meh, i don't see how this is a lesson in humility. my comments didn't cause the clippers to lose the series. i'm not bothered by all these people who were so offended by my comments. i'm gonna keep doing what i do"
idealreaddit,dont even try this sub doesn't respect him as a coach at all
idealreaddit,"I don't play 2k, that game is god awful"
idealreaddit,He needs the rest
idealreaddit,Blake is putting up 25/13/8…
idealreaddit,regular season warriors
idealreaddit,eSports
idealreaddit,"Oh my fucking god. Come on. That is an extremely unfair comparison for Doc
"
idealreaddit,Rockets are fucked
idealreaddit,$0
idealreaddit,There isn't a lot of defense there
idealreaddit,I hate Breen
idealreaddit,Tends to happen when you play the raptors
idealreaddit,"Aldridge, Griffin, Randolph, Gasol, LeBron?"
idealreaddit,oh yea thats true
idealreaddit,Not hating on Starbury just saying the level of competition in China is a joke so him dominating is unsurprising. 
idealreaddit,He's undefeated. 
idealreaddit,how does it feel spurs
idealreaddit,No.
idealreaddit,you'd be dumb to think that way considering he misses nearly 60% of his shots in the postseason
idealreaddit,Agreed
idealreaddit,"Chris Paul- height

He'd be the GOAT"
idealreaddit,Whoever played the best in that series
idealreaddit,Because it's stupid?
idealreaddit,Who was it
idealreaddit,"yes. we can actually score points, unlike the grizzlies"
idealreaddit,Barnes doesn't try to intentionally hurt players like Bev
idealreaddit,He shoots like 46% or 47% when hacked. Saw it on another post earlier today
idealreaddit,Undeservedly
idealreaddit,that is far from the truth
idealreaddit,Wherever I can make the most money. 
idealreaddit,Then you are really dumb. 
idealreaddit,Nah I'm pretty happy
idealreaddit,thats what happens when dj gets bullshit fouls called on him and only plays 9 minutes
idealreaddit,wow they were AAU teammates i had no idea
idealreaddit,Cousins isn't nearly as good as you would think. Shoots 63% from 0-3 feet
idealreaddit,i live on the ground floor
idealreaddit,"""Left""

He was fired"
idealreaddit,Why is Allen shooting
idealreaddit,Mark Jackson just says the same dumbass shit over and over. 
idealreaddit,of course he isn't wrong lol
idealreaddit,"Momentum from game to game in a series is a farce. 

Clippers"
idealreaddit,wow fuck harden. we havent fouled him once
idealreaddit,who had the better mvp season in your opinion?
idealreaddit,Want to elaborate..?
idealreaddit,"Both of those guys were still much better shooters than Rivers though. Plus the question is not would the team be good, it's whether or not it'd be as good as the current Clippers."
idealreaddit,What about X
idealreaddit,"nah, they should pull another houston"
idealreaddit,nice shot klay
idealreaddit,Games 2 and 3 were both good for him
idealreaddit,not trolling
idealreaddit,I'll take the guy who can actually shoot the basketball
idealreaddit,oh i meant on this subreddit
idealreaddit,God I love First Take.
idealreaddit,No he isn't. 
idealreaddit,nah kobe is an all time great but im in a trolling mood rn
idealreaddit,I'd say the tweet has the right order
idealreaddit,CP3 easily
idealreaddit,"So you're saying  you have a 25 win team...you take away Elfrid Payton, Tobias Harris, Channing Frye, along with their top 5 pick, and add CP3, and all of a sudden they can contend for a championship? Absolutely not and CP3 would realize that and demand out of there immediately. Which is why the Magic would not do it."
idealreaddit,youre welcome
idealreaddit,Marc is shooting 40% from the field though
idealreaddit,"Alright, let's see playoff Hedo. Our 3 ball is off, maybe he'll be the one to get us back into the feel. "
idealreaddit,"Paul, Irving, Butler, Durant, James"
idealreaddit,"Glad he's gone from the Warriors. Great fit for the Pels offensively, but they need a defensive-minded assistant along with him, which is where they really struggled this past season. Ron Adams?"
idealreaddit,thats because rockets suck
idealreaddit,Vancouver
idealreaddit,"start playing like the best center in the nba marc, come on"
idealreaddit,I doubt it. There has been a good amount of hacking and 3 of the games weren't that close
idealreaddit,Jamal Crawford
idealreaddit,the only thing klay knows how to do on offense is shoot
idealreaddit,He doesn't have that ability. 
idealreaddit,Yes. This season was a fluke. 
idealreaddit,"Yea because he hates the Spurs

Now he's saying we have no chance against Houston because they're deeper than us. As if the Spurs aren't insanely deep..."
idealreaddit,regular season team
idealreaddit,"YES DJ

JAMAL WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU"
idealreaddit,"really? matt should be fined $250,000 for this tweet?"
idealreaddit,how can you say clips suck. they're the best team in the nba...
idealreaddit,"Clippers are more hated and are the favorites

Clippers will win every game CP3 plays and honestly should be favored even without him"
idealreaddit,i thought i spend my entire left here
idealreaddit,No shit
idealreaddit,where you getting these numbers? been looking for a source on midrange shooting %s
idealreaddit,you really think the rockets have a shot in this series?
idealreaddit,lol not even close
idealreaddit,how is batum overrated
idealreaddit,"role players got really cold, DJ getting owned by Dwight and generally not playing his best, poor effort"
idealreaddit,I'm a better poster than you are
idealreaddit,Guess the Nets played really good D too
idealreaddit,stop hacking i have a headache and am tired
idealreaddit,ok what are you thinking
idealreaddit,glad hardens flops arent getting called
idealreaddit,Matt Barnes is better than Jeff Green even at 35.
idealreaddit,Oh yes. Completely agreed. Absolutely terrible move. 
idealreaddit,Chris Paul
idealreaddit,Wife
idealreaddit,"Because lebron has been shooting awfully and turning it over at a disgusting rate. Blake has been better, and it's not close at all."
idealreaddit,thats how much better clippers are than rockets also how well they match up with rockets
idealreaddit,typical warriors
idealreaddit,"Cavs starters played more minutes than Clippers ""starters"" (no Redick), plus the game was in Cleveland....and the final margin was 11 so saying the Cavs blew them out by 30 is wrong..."
idealreaddit,Cmon James
idealreaddit,What the fuck are these calls
idealreaddit,not an unpopular opinion at all
idealreaddit,CP33333333
idealreaddit,rockets gonna give up soon
idealreaddit,ya fuck you dwight
idealreaddit,We'll double Harden with JJ and someone else
idealreaddit,they're the only team that's been able to win in oracle in the playoffs..? maybe because the warriors' only other opponent has been the pelicans?
idealreaddit,You can think what you want bro. Doesn't matter to me. 
idealreaddit,mods deleting everything about this
idealreaddit,Oops my bad
idealreaddit,top 500 pg all time top 1000 player all time
idealreaddit,yep i would say that was a reasonable opinion at the time of posting
idealreaddit,Nah
idealreaddit,does barnes have like 10 steals already
idealreaddit,"alt accounts are for losers

plus if i were to make an alt account why would i pose as a fucking warriors fan"
idealreaddit,Not really
idealreaddit,6th out of 16 total which is the context that the table is in is pretty high. 
idealreaddit,"Another ""foul"" on Harden"
idealreaddit,i love big baby
idealreaddit,Dang you're even more confident than I am
idealreaddit,Staples would be empty if we played tonight too
idealreaddit,"Just because his game will age well doesn't mean he will still be in his prime.

Chris Paul is still the best PG in the NBA but you could argue he isn't still in his prime."
idealreaddit,They mad
idealreaddit,Sexism
idealreaddit,Hope LeBron puts this dumbass in his place. He's gotten way too confident for being an above average player
idealreaddit,Warriors getting all the fucking calls
idealreaddit,"No, Conley: 1.252 pts/fga

Gasol: 1.248 pts/fga"
idealreaddit,Kyrie easily
idealreaddit,CP3: GOAT
idealreaddit,this should come as a surprise to no one
idealreaddit,give that team a league-average bench and they def get to the conference finals. you can't score on them and they would be still be good offensively
idealreaddit,Oh shit you're right. Nick Young was fucking incredible 
idealreaddit,russ plays shitty d
idealreaddit,Winner of this game goes to WCF
idealreaddit,Yea they were above average in the regular season but sucked as usual in the playoffs. Doesn't help that Gasol was hurt
idealreaddit,Did they want a vacation when they beat the fuck out of your Warriors?
idealreaddit,They don't play tomorrow. I've got Atlanta and Memphis today
idealreaddit,If KD has another season like 2014 and LeBron has another season like 2015 in 2016 I think KD will have passed him.
idealreaddit,pretty bad at it
idealreaddit,You realize Westbrook gets to the line just as much
idealreaddit,damn curry sucks so bad against actual defenses
idealreaddit,"Playing all 82 games, nabbing the 3rd seed, leading the NBA in FG% (2nd highest all time) and rebounds, top 5 in blocks, 3rd in DPOY, 1st team all defense, yet he's lucky to make 3rd team?

FOH"
idealreaddit,respect
idealreaddit,No Doc is not the GM
idealreaddit,That's one
idealreaddit,he's adding to the discussion he should not be downvoted. the immaturity of reddit is hilarious really
idealreaddit,"this is the fucking playoffs, refs"
idealreaddit,oh is that why he's president of the players union?
idealreaddit,Hates rockets
idealreaddit,Lol warriors bitching crying lol
idealreaddit,"People will tell you it's because Blake missed 5 weeks, but he only played 4 less games than Aldridge."
idealreaddit,Austin Rivers
idealreaddit,He's 27. His prime will only be a couple more years
idealreaddit,lol umad
idealreaddit,What the hell is that facial hair Kyle
idealreaddit,not surprised
idealreaddit,Griffin and Jordan?
idealreaddit,Way too much
idealreaddit,dwight sure does like to yell
idealreaddit,He always gets flak for his all-star appearance and is generally not respected as a *very* good player.
idealreaddit,I mean he has pretty good vision but he rarely makes use of it and commits a lot of unforced turnovers.
idealreaddit,Defiitely.
idealreaddit,AIRBALL
idealreaddit,whats a better term for these types of people who think everything is a societal problem
idealreaddit,lol noah
idealreaddit,You said the tradition was them choking. Nothing about them getting out of the second round (which is still possible this season). 
idealreaddit,They said it was an ankle sprain. 
idealreaddit,The irony.
idealreaddit,per game
idealreaddit,"Yep they clearly had a chance considering they won

The last line of your comment is just stupid lol you should edit that out"
idealreaddit,Arguable
idealreaddit,Melo
idealreaddit,my hamburger buns got moldy so i've been eating bun-less cheeseburgers. i know how it is
idealreaddit,cp3 got snubbed more than harden but he doesn't care about these dumb awards. he'll continue to play his game and destroy the rockets
idealreaddit,this feels like the all-star game with all these bricked 3s
idealreaddit,i dont think hes better than blake either
idealreaddit,No. I don't see how you could take him over Cousins. Never been a fan of his playstyle on offense
idealreaddit,"don't think they completely gave up, harden just got caught ball watching"
idealreaddit,harden draws the most bullshit fucking foul calls
idealreaddit,Because john wall can do no wrong
idealreaddit,welcome to sports
idealreaddit,holy fuck
idealreaddit,"&lt;IFRAME FRAMEBORDER=0 MARGINWIDTH=0 MARGINHEIGHT=0 SCROLLING=NO align=""center"" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=450 SRC=""http://distro.megom.tv/player-inside.php?id=dankmemes&amp;width=600&amp;height=450""&gt;&lt;/IFRAME&gt;"
idealreaddit,since when are the clippers griping about offensive interference?
idealreaddit,Who cares what idiots on Twitter think
idealreaddit,[INCORRECT STAT]
idealreaddit,for the clippers
idealreaddit,"CP3 stepped up last game too when we lost. We just need better effort on D and boards, and for our 3pt shots to go down, plus DJ staying on the court and out of foul trouble."
idealreaddit,CP3 + Melo
idealreaddit,Yup
idealreaddit,Troll
idealreaddit,It's not like Bogut can shoot
idealreaddit,by far
idealreaddit,WHOA THEY PLAYED TOGETHER IN AAU? NO WAY
idealreaddit,uhhh yes they are
idealreaddit,Just like Patty mills and diaw and belinelli did last round. doesn't matter because our starting five is so much better
idealreaddit,a comment like that does not deserve a counter argument. too stupid.
idealreaddit,not gonna be able to do it
idealreaddit,Cool?
idealreaddit,No that dude is terrible
idealreaddit,how are we losing to such an awful team. pathetic performance
idealreaddit,If we had made it past the Rockets there's no doubt in my mind the Warriors would have destroyed us. Our guys were exhausted
idealreaddit,he played 25 and prigs played 21 in round 1 against the awful mavs. thats pretty bad
idealreaddit,"Unless Pop wants to come to LA, Doc should not be fired"
idealreaddit,Outside of the Rockets Curry's path has been hilariously easy
idealreaddit,i wouldnt risk it but its your body you do what you want with it
idealreaddit,harden and howard a couple of soft ass bitches
idealreaddit,Let's see it actually happen instead of assuming bro
idealreaddit,You're joking right. This team is 4.5 players deep. Is that 4.5 players the best 4.5 in the NBA? Probably. But only 3 of them showed up. You don't win a series with 3 players. 
idealreaddit,That's what I like to see
idealreaddit,why are the rockets so bad
idealreaddit,Rose
idealreaddit,God I love Matt Barnes.
idealreaddit,"Paul, Jordan, James, Duncan, Shaq"
idealreaddit,god i hate harden. why is redick not the one guarding him
idealreaddit,Mike Conley is incredible
idealreaddit,"Paul &gt; Curry  
Griffin &gt; Davis  
Anthony &gt; George"
idealreaddit,Redick is also one of the best from midrange 
idealreaddit,tony got into klays head
idealreaddit,"Paul, Allen, Leonard, Green, Jordan"
idealreaddit,Do we have anything more definitive? Pretty sure we don't.
idealreaddit,without cp3
idealreaddit,hawes actually shows up in the playoffs tho
idealreaddit,Ah I see
idealreaddit,"1. Chris Paul  
2. Stephen Curry  
3. Derrick Rose  
4. Mike Conley  
5. John Wall  
6. Kyrie Irving  
7. Jeff Teague  
8. Jason Terry"
idealreaddit,If ur an MVP caliber player u should be able to carry the load urself. Curry isn't that kind of player
idealreaddit,dont have any consistent backup anything
idealreaddit,"Paul, Bryant, Durant, Duncan, Kareem wins"
idealreaddit,Alright I'll put down $1
idealreaddit,Ariza by far because of the defense
idealreaddit,Fuck you Breen
idealreaddit,Ayesha is not attractive
idealreaddit,"Paul, Bryant, Iguodala, Morris, Cousins"
idealreaddit,That call was horse shit
idealreaddit,No when warriors were down 2-1 clips were the faves
idealreaddit,That edit is a little more realistic.
idealreaddit,Because I forgot I said that?
idealreaddit,you are wrong
idealreaddit,curry u know you cant shoot midrange right
idealreaddit,You sure are starved for attention huh
idealreaddit,improve the bench. re-sign deandre jordan. get a younger 3 and D guy who isn't undersized
idealreaddit,No I'm not
idealreaddit,he puts that in the basket we get the 2nd seed
idealreaddit,"Considering there are 2 players on the clippers who are better than this year's MVP, I'd say a lot. "
idealreaddit,Yep fuck curry
idealreaddit,lmao this argument is over
idealreaddit,"How is that relevant. 

He played 33 MPG in the playoffs last season. "
idealreaddit,"That ""special killer trait"" being media adoration"
idealreaddit,Harden's midrange game sucks though that's not a good barometer to compare to
idealreaddit,Give me 100/1 and I still wouldn't. 
idealreaddit,good to know
idealreaddit,There have been talks but nothing concrete...
idealreaddit,Extra rest should help the Clippers more than the Rockets.
idealreaddit,No it isn't. 
idealreaddit,they could. its only game 3
idealreaddit,I think it's funny I'm on these peoples' minds so much. 
idealreaddit,that would be some impressive dedication considering i watch every clippers game including preseason
idealreaddit,both
idealreaddit,Rockets fans are incredibly insecure and love to downvote
idealreaddit,god you are a shitty poster
idealreaddit,i have 11 (now 12) comments in this thread if thats not enough for you you should find a new fix
idealreaddit,if you take care of the fucking ball they cant score. stop turning it over against these baddies
idealreaddit,they both play D
idealreaddit,clippers have no cap space. letting deandre walk wouldn't benefit them in any way
idealreaddit,"Seriously how the fuck does he not win it. Look at the Cavs this year vs last year. 

Hell, look at the Cavs now compared to the beginning of the year. "
idealreaddit,Oakland Warriors (fuck the Raiders)
idealreaddit,"no its the opposite, they make it so that you glide across the floor more easily on your approach"
idealreaddit,how exactly was he outplayed by prigs. care to take a look at their numbers? or did you even watch the game?
idealreaddit,**PEPPER**
idealreaddit,Lol Draymond wouldn't fit in in Memphis he's soft
idealreaddit,no he does that
idealreaddit,most of my comments in this comment chain are not legit
idealreaddit,I'm a clippers fan
idealreaddit,how? chris is better on offense and defense
idealreaddit,In the last 3 games Redick with the ball in his hands struck fear in my heart. 
idealreaddit,not really lol. everyone has been high on the rockets since their first series
idealreaddit,I fucking love Austin Rivers
idealreaddit,LAWLERS LAW
idealreaddit,No they need a defensive-minded coach
idealreaddit,Am I
idealreaddit,[what an incredibly ignorant think to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHEVi_H5jYE)
idealreaddit,It is absolutely a narrative
idealreaddit,LOL NICE FLOP
idealreaddit,If a series went to 7 games that means it was a highly competitive series. 80% win rate is telling
idealreaddit,Chris Paul. It's his time
idealreaddit,"Alvin Gentry (and Ron Adams) is the reason for the Warriors' success this season, not Kerr."
idealreaddit,youre gonna die bro
idealreaddit,RESPECT THE CRAWFORD FLOP
idealreaddit,lol rockets suck dick
idealreaddit,LOL BRICK CITY
idealreaddit,VINCE
idealreaddit,I'll 1v1 u right now bro
idealreaddit,Yay. You get a free (pajama) t-shirt and the crowd looks nice
idealreaddit,No he can't. 
idealreaddit,might have something to do with his team on the verge of elimination
idealreaddit,goddammit jeff green
idealreaddit,Absolutely fucking incredible
idealreaddit,"That doesn't surprise me, 2K has always made the better sports games (except NHL)"
idealreaddit,lol regular season
idealreaddit,This is an insult to Austin Rivers
idealreaddit,"couldnt find the source for 36% but i saw it on a post another guy made, he got it from nba.com

still 41% is not good"
idealreaddit,What the fuck are you talking about
idealreaddit,Jamal had 56% in 2014
idealreaddit,lol this is the harden rockets' first trip past the first round breh you have no room to talk
idealreaddit,Atlanta by 12
idealreaddit,"Kidd, Nash, Thomas, Cousy are not better than Chris Paul. Love this sub's knee jerk reactions

For fucks sake Chris average 22/4/9/2 on 50/42/94 this post-season. This was not on him. Top 3 all time no question at all."
idealreaddit,"&gt;He is already arguably as good as CP3

No fucking way"
idealreaddit,lol yes because the spurs put tony fucking parker on cp3 bro. and jrue did not start for the pels
idealreaddit,"lol you're trying to convince /r/nba to switch to the flair of their least favorite team because you want them to beat their favorite team

ok"
idealreaddit,Who are one and two
idealreaddit,keep it coming
idealreaddit,Sure if you want to be an idiot.
idealreaddit,Jamal Crawford too
idealreaddit,you're wrong
idealreaddit,Is there anyone else who can't stand this play-by-play guy? He annoys the fuck out of me
idealreaddit,Lil Chris wouldn't marry that ugly hoe
idealreaddit,Harden is not better than Chris Paul
idealreaddit,"Paul, Curry, Irving, Westbrook, Wall"
idealreaddit,"Ya....take that with a grain of salt. We get absolutely slaughtered in the paint when DJ is out, without fail.

Plus those numbers don't make sense because our drtg this year was 103.0"
idealreaddit,wow i just had castle on for 15 minutes for no reason
idealreaddit,Oh yea that guy says a lot of dumb shit
idealreaddit,"These are good but I would switch LMA/Cousins with Griffin/Jordan

Also Butler over Thompson"
idealreaddit,were you trolling
idealreaddit,"If you think JR is anywhere near as good at getting his own shot as prime Jamal, then you need to go watch jamal"
idealreaddit,Warriors get one bucket on the fast break and Breen jizzes his pants
idealreaddit,i criticize spencer hawes more than anyone. and jamal
idealreaddit,yeh breh
idealreaddit,Harden 4 fouls!!
idealreaddit,from Bill Simmons
idealreaddit,ok bro
idealreaddit,I don't read Grantland and still thought it was ass
idealreaddit,Downvoted
idealreaddit,He sucks in the regular season too just not as bad
idealreaddit,agreed
idealreaddit,they arent by far the weakest team. hawks and wiz exist
idealreaddit,yea it is literally the only thing ive ever done
idealreaddit,He was only in for 74 seconds. Idk why. Pretty odd
idealreaddit,rockets are fucked
idealreaddit,Matt Barnes &gt; Harrison Barnes
idealreaddit,FOUL
idealreaddit,We'd play the mavs in round 1 which would be an easy series. Probably win in 4 or 5. Then you guys have to play the Spurs and we get HCA against either. Would've been interesting for sure. Bet we'd be in the WCF right now
idealreaddit,He's not a mediocre fucking defender open your eyes and stop looking at the *highly flawed* advanced stats
idealreaddit,how have we fallen short of expectations we were the 3rd seed and lost to the 2nd seed. we beat the fucking defending champs. get out of here with that bullshit narrative
idealreaddit,Couldn't* care less
idealreaddit,that was a charge
idealreaddit,Grizzlies
idealreaddit,lmao this sub thinks every older woman is a milf
idealreaddit,Yea that hurts but doesn't excuse the poor offensive play. 
idealreaddit,how can people be such pussies
idealreaddit,this sub is made of up SJW
idealreaddit,This is the most ignorant thing I've read in a long time
idealreaddit,"Kyrie is better than Wall

Klay can definitely be argue to be as good as Wall. Much better shooter and scorer, just as good on D."
idealreaddit,that's not a shower thought
idealreaddit,No…
idealreaddit,Blake is better than all of those. 
idealreaddit,Watch them play then. Either way CP3 comes out on top
idealreaddit,Curry by far...
idealreaddit,he actually fouled tho
idealreaddit,reported
idealreaddit,"This is *predictions*

DJ finished 3rd in DPOY voting, I think he's the best bet for 1st team all D"
idealreaddit,stop taking midrange jumpers grizzlies

idealreaddit,no way mchale gets fired he just got an extension
idealreaddit,Him
idealreaddit,Well if we're going by who was better rather than legacy/greatness then I'd take Stockton and Paul over Magic.
idealreaddit,These people boo everything
idealreaddit,59.9 seconds
idealreaddit,this aint the finals
idealreaddit,Thank you for that stat.
idealreaddit,DJ is underrated. I hear people say he is a bad defender on a pretty regular basis
idealreaddit,It's literally called executive *of the year*. 
idealreaddit,Why does every fucking thing this guy does get upvoted to the top of the sub
idealreaddit,Yea that was incredible
idealreaddit,I feel like everyone on the Hawks is like this. Bud has built a great culture there
idealreaddit,Nah I'd say it's his best considering the efficiency
idealreaddit,Timmy doesn't have much left? I do not believe that
idealreaddit,/u/idealreaddit*

idealreaddit,hitting shots consistently? that's not john wall
idealreaddit,YEAAA GO ROCKETS

idealreaddit,so are you switching to warriors flair if rockets win tomorrow
idealreaddit,corey brewer with the flop boi

LeBron, Durant, Paul, Griffin, Davis, Melo, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, George, Gasol"

idealreaddit,There is no such thing as momentum from game to game in a series.
idealreaddit,Idk that's not how I see it
idealreaddit,"we just had the highest scoring quarter of the post-season....without chris paul

the step down from spurs d to rockets d is real"
idealreaddit,No they would not. Lin *maybe*. Not Swaggy P. 
idealreaddit,http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html
idealreaddit,matt barnes with 20 pts
idealreaddit,Well yea because the difference in age is huge. 
idealreaddit,"Draymond ""Reggie Jackson"" Green"
idealreaddit,Clearly the hivemind of /r/nba is always right about everything.
idealreaddit,How do you figure that
idealreaddit,dwight is a small man
idealreaddit,I never said 4-0
idealreaddit,People tend to downvote me a lot especially when the Clippers lose
idealreaddit,Since when do it hate on you
idealreaddit,He's probably 8-11 or something right…horribly small sample size
idealreaddit,exactly
idealreaddit,lmao yea cap'n crunch fucks the roof of my mouth up. gotta let it get a little soggy first
idealreaddit,They are when they play like it...it's not like this team won 60 games for no reason
idealreaddit,I don't think it will
idealreaddit,Conley/Allen/Durant/Randolph/Gasol &gt; Westbrook/Roberson/Durant/Ibaka/Kanter
idealreaddit,Blazers
idealreaddit,Truth
idealreaddit,"warriors, spurs"

idealreaddit,Darren is definitely good enough he is not the problem with the Kings
idealreaddit,No it hasn't. 
idealreaddit,Zeke is so overrated....there is no argument for Kidd over Paul.
idealreaddit,Because people are overly sensitive. I think Skip is absolutely hilarious. And he has a ton of knowledge
idealreaddit,because he is
idealreaddit,op thinks bowling shoes make you stick to the floor
idealreaddit,No. Not worth the risk.
idealreaddit,john wall is really dumb
idealreaddit,I don't know how people can circlejerk so strongly about something that is just plain incorrect lol. I've seen Curry throw more than a few tantrums when a call doesn't go his way.
idealreaddit,Thanks in large part to LeBron. Curry has nothing to do with the Warriors being an elite defensive team.
idealreaddit,Guess media felt they needed to give GSW some kind of end of year award since they won't win anything else. 
idealreaddit,dont know if speights will be healthy. but if we could survive against the spurs bench we'll be fine against GSW's
idealreaddit,"No doc gets shat on as a coach. He is a very popular answer to the question of ""who is the most overrated coach"" and is left off an alarming number of top 10 coaches lists. "
idealreaddit,uh you didnt even win by double digits. despite attempting twice as many FTs
idealreaddit,Top 2 scorer I'd say. Only Durant has him beat. 
idealreaddit,"If they fix the time then the Wizards probably don't run the same ""play"" so this is a pretty pointless discussion. "
idealreaddit,i mean your team sucks
idealreaddit,Might have something to do with playing the Bulls and Celtics
idealreaddit,You saw he how played this year and think he only has a couple years left?
idealreaddit,this game is over
idealreaddit,nice flop
idealreaddit,your half-court offense sucks
idealreaddit,Go Clippers
idealreaddit,Lebron has such bad shot selection but he's LeBron so it doesn't matter
idealreaddit,Curry
idealreaddit,Blake is the clippers franchise. We're not trading him away for 30 y/o Aldridge. 
idealreaddit,fuck. theres so many schools in texas
idealreaddit,u mad
idealreaddit,"yea im not refuting that, lebron would run the offense no doubt but you are still starting austin rivers

it would be the worst-spaced offense in the nba"
idealreaddit,Dumb. Go look at CP3s numbers. Better than what curry has done in the POs
idealreaddit,Prime Jamal
idealreaddit,big baby has some incredible flops
idealreaddit,we're missing the 3rd best player in the nba....you're missing beverley and dmo....
idealreaddit,wow dwight that was a bit much
idealreaddit,Matt Barnes is a really good guy.
idealreaddit,DeAndre is better in every way
idealreaddit,I get where you're coming from just don't think it's realistic. No one who could offer us what we would want in return for him would want him for what they would have to give up.
idealreaddit,3rd behind Magic and Stockton
idealreaddit,?
idealreaddit,conley is so lovable
idealreaddit,Go Sports
idealreaddit,Why? The ref still gets the ball and gives it to the inbounder
idealreaddit,He is a better coach. 
idealreaddit,"No. Jamal leads the second unit, plus he hogs the ball too much when blake should be the only one holding the ball for any period of time"
idealreaddit,…which is a sport
idealreaddit,Missed two yesterday tho
idealreaddit,Glad he's gone.
idealreaddit,oh my god this flopping
idealreaddit,how so
idealreaddit,"1. Paul  
2. Jamal  
3. Melo  
4. Blake  
5. Al"
idealreaddit,"35 mpg for a 34 year old in the regular season is pretty bad

Blake's playstyle in the regular season this year wasn't all that physically taxing either."
idealreaddit,They weren't a top 3 D. Top 3 was warriors bucks Spurs
idealreaddit,you think lebron can shut down chris paul?
idealreaddit,No. They should move the 3pt line back though
idealreaddit,glorified chucker with great teammates
idealreaddit,Yes they were
idealreaddit,"ok you're trolling right? deandre literally stands there. no ""throwing around"" going on at all."
idealreaddit,thats good now you wont get diabetes
idealreaddit,lol goddamn dude
idealreaddit,"Play him if he's ready, rest him if he's not. I don't think they should base it on the results of this game. If he is good to go on Wednesday, he should play."
idealreaddit,Wow that's stupid. 
idealreaddit,Durant is one of the best scorers ever. I'll take him
idealreaddit,"Guess everyone in this thread forgot Blake Griffin exists. 

Also Cousins is grossly overrated. "
idealreaddit,alrighty dude
idealreaddit,1-0 in game 7 at home
idealreaddit,Conley
idealreaddit,Marc Gasol by far
idealreaddit,looking forward to the lottery?
idealreaddit,No I'm not trolling Davis is an extremely overrated defender.
idealreaddit,flop
idealreaddit,tjones and ariza are both doing alright so far...
idealreaddit,russ was a mvp candidate and his percentages were terrible
idealreaddit,To keep himself fresh for the playoffs and to elongate his career. 
idealreaddit,Gone from the clippers? Yes. 
idealreaddit,"JVG goes on long, stupid rants that are completely unrelated to the game

Ian Eagle just annoys the hell out of me, I can't really pinpoint why."

why am i getting downvoted for answering the question"

idealreaddit,Goink pretty well for us
idealreaddit,ken mauer everybody
idealreaddit,"Grantland Basketball Hour wasn't any good, you really want him to do another TV show?"
idealreaddit,that shit was disgusting
idealreaddit,that show sucked anyway
idealreaddit,Holy shit warriors are getting so much help from the refs. Fucking bullshit
idealreaddit,glad to know ive gotten to you
idealreaddit,CP3
idealreaddit,i hate this play by play guy
idealreaddit,where the hell did muscala come from
idealreaddit,Spurs are definitely the sub's favorites
idealreaddit,ZBOOOOOOOOOO
idealreaddit,"Clippers will beat Rockets  
Cavs Bulls is a toss-up"
idealreaddit,"lol umad

Mavs are terrible"
idealreaddit,There are 7 fucking rounds good luck fitting that into 1 day. 
idealreaddit,2015 warriors
idealreaddit,Warriors are not that good
idealreaddit,/r/warriors
idealreaddit,Rockets win in a blowout
idealreaddit,"Everything we do on reddit is meaningless. That's why it's enjoyable. 

But thanks. "
idealreaddit,"really? because i only mentioned two players, who happen to be the two players on the clippers with insane handles"
idealreaddit,you're*
idealreaddit,Rockets are the easier opponent for GSW
idealreaddit,Deandre Jordan
idealreaddit,http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/per_career_p.html
idealreaddit,yea i can agree to that
idealreaddit,uh no i wouldnt
idealreaddit,Am I wrong
idealreaddit,you sound mad
idealreaddit,1-9 from 3.....why
idealreaddit,yup
idealreaddit,He couldn't shoot. You think he got that 50+% from the field from shooting...? No…he got it in the post. 
idealreaddit,Not necessarily and not this season
idealreaddit,"Not a bad player developer but idk how to describe his issue. He doesn't trust his young players and doesn't give them the minutes they need to thrive in the NBA, instead he gives all their minutes to Kirk Hinrich"
idealreaddit,Sure but it's still not the right way to use the downvote button
idealreaddit,Trying to be reasonable
idealreaddit,ahh fuck
idealreaddit,So who exactly do you think is going to approach DJ while having a better shot at a chip than the Clippers? No one
idealreaddit,"Chris Paul would be MVP, Clippers would have a bottom 5 defense and be the 6th seed, Warriors would sweep their way through the playoffs and be regarded as one of the greatest defensive teams ever, if not the best, as well as a historically great offense. Greatest team not named the 96 Bulls. Probably win 70 games"
idealreaddit,"yea thats not true

http://espn.go.com/nba/shotchart?gameId=400793867"
idealreaddit,"thats not all, our effort was fucking terrible, got destroyed on the boards and played no defense"
idealreaddit,Calm down
idealreaddit,why is papanikolaou out here
idealreaddit,refs fucking us raw holy fuck
idealreaddit,how about now
idealreaddit,JJ is the only player who knows how to guard Harden
idealreaddit,Blake Griffin is good to very good defensively when he tries
idealreaddit,Well I can't argue with that
idealreaddit,Butler is not the best two way player in the game...he's not even the best two way player on the court
idealreaddit,Kerr got the assistants. Not Myers
idealreaddit,harden flopped barnes didnt do shit. harden walked right into him
idealreaddit,lawlers law
idealreaddit,"matt barnes ""goaltend"" 2nd quarter game 5 vs spurs"
idealreaddit,"forcing turnovers, pushing tempo, gaining momentum."
idealreaddit,"1. Chris Paul  
2. Blake Griffin  
3. DeAndre Jordan  
4. JJ Redick  
5. Matt Barnes"
idealreaddit,The announcers said ankle
idealreaddit,what an awful decision by marc
idealreaddit,shaq speaking truth
idealreaddit,Whoever is telling you that shit is an idiot. 
idealreaddit,"Defense in every way, passing/playmaking, inside shooting/scoring, rebounding, leadership…

Only thing curry has on him is 3pt shooting and CP3 is still elite at that. "
idealreaddit,Chris Paul + Blake Griffin
idealreaddit,The loser has gotten crucified on here after every game lol. Can't imagine what it will be like after a series loss.
idealreaddit,"you told me earlier that chris paul has no killer gene or something of the sort, and most of your comment history is inane clippers hate. thats why i asked."
idealreaddit,*Exactly* what I've been wondering. Makes no sense to me at all.
idealreaddit,the first reply lmfao
idealreaddit,bill simmons sighting
idealreaddit,not really im better than 99% of the posters here who just parrot the popular opinions that will get them karma. i at least bring a different perspective and am not an asshole while doing it
idealreaddit,lamb and mint jelly...
idealreaddit,he's really salty about the clips
idealreaddit,nice turnover
idealreaddit,About 75%
idealreaddit,How Shaq manages to find a suit too big for him is beyond me
idealreaddit,Blake Griffin &gt; Westbrook
idealreaddit,mad people like to stalk me and downvote me
idealreaddit,You're right. Shot below 40% from midrange this season. 
idealreaddit,As if this sub praises Doc as a coach? lmao get out of here. He's not even considered a top 5 coach here
idealreaddit,Oh yea that is true. 
idealreaddit,Playoff klay is real
idealreaddit,Also said we're not bringing in another max guy though. [Markazi](https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/600086102523977729)
idealreaddit,Uhhh Trevor Ariza?
idealreaddit,Paul and Griffin are 3 and 4 respectively
idealreaddit,You're an idiot
idealreaddit,"Guess they broke tradition against the Spurs huh

Tell me, do you even cheer for a team, or is your entire interest in the NBA just inane hatred of the clippers?"
idealreaddit,GREAT CALL
idealreaddit,1
idealreaddit,did the same in a close win against blazers when kaman pushed him down
idealreaddit,Holy shit how do they have 25 pts
idealreaddit,"No, that'd be a stupid thing to think."
idealreaddit,No our starting five is better. 
idealreaddit,Doc isn't a GM
idealreaddit,No Thibs has no idea what an offensive system is and would be a terrible fit with the warriors high paced offense. 
idealreaddit,"Not to mention game 5 was not a close game, he played probably only 6 or less minutes in that quarter"
idealreaddit,Want to elaborate?
idealreaddit,If CP3 is out tonight I'll downgrade it to 5 but I'd still give the Clippers a good shot to win the game.
idealreaddit,"1. [No they didn't](http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats)  
2. Points scored + points responsible for divided by total team points. Curry is at 38%"
idealreaddit,I like our rivalry with the Grizzlies more. Either series would be great if we make it to WCF. 
idealreaddit,"Exactly. Against the Spurs we threw away game 2 and got absolutely annihilated in game 3. Many people said the Clippers were done and the Spurs had all the momentum, but they came out there and beat them convincingly in game 4 on the road. "
idealreaddit,"[With Paul, Redick, Barnes, Griffin, Jordan, Clippers defensive rating was 100.0](http://stats.nba.com/league/lineups/#!/advanced/?Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=MIN&amp;dir=1)

[While their overall defensive rating was 103.0](http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats/_/sort/defensiveEff/order/false)"
idealreaddit,"4 healthy centers? Bogut and Ezeli, and...?"
idealreaddit,Rockets
idealreaddit,Go Rockets!
idealreaddit,media sucks warriors dicks so hard its unbearable
idealreaddit,why would you assume that
idealreaddit,94%
idealreaddit,Warriors fucked
idealreaddit,thats not unpopular
idealreaddit,"Thanks

Bailey 69 GP  
Vandeweghe 68 GP

So if he doesn't make conference finals next year he'll be in first"
idealreaddit,Damn you guys have a ton of shooters. Although two of them are old as fuck
idealreaddit,"that's what happens when you live at the FT line

lets compare their eFG%"
idealreaddit,MJ pushed off on his series-winning shot over the Jazz in the '98 Finals
idealreaddit,If those guys are next level what does that make Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford
idealreaddit,dae AAU
idealreaddit,Yep I know about the on/off splits. They're much better defensively with him on the court.
idealreaddit,Yes
idealreaddit,finally he gets punished for his constant flopping
idealreaddit,Grizzlies offense is bad.
idealreaddit,Your team missed the playoffs. 
idealreaddit,Spencer Hawes probably
idealreaddit,"middleton butler green. green, barnes and jj off the bench, starting lineup of paul, butler, middleton, griffin, jordan"
idealreaddit,and why exactly would ballmer take the clippers from los angeles where they are ridiculously profitable
idealreaddit,Harden easily
idealreaddit,That's insane.
idealreaddit,And CP3 had 22 and 10
idealreaddit,There's no anti-warriors circlejerk
idealreaddit,Oh my god lol the persecution complex
idealreaddit,Cap'n Crunch
idealreaddit,POINT GOD
idealreaddit,Yea that's part of it. Also can get the hacking team's offense out of rhythm and allows the hacked team to set up their defense so the hacking team can't get out on the fast break. Also allows players to rest which is big for the clippers who have 6.5 NBA players on their roster. 
idealreaddit,Matt Barnes
idealreaddit,"That's because he was our least injured wing player. Either way *someone* would have played hurt, and he was our most playable guy.

Sucks but that's how it goes. "
idealreaddit,Fuck the Spurs
idealreaddit,"&gt;""I loved my outfit in Game 4,"" Wall told McGinnis. ""I don’t care what decision nobody makes, I am going to be me. I am going to wear what John Wall is comfortable with. The only somebody who said something because he won a fashion contest, once.""

Is that last sentence even an actual sentence"
idealreaddit,"Matt is definitely more valuable than Austin, especially when you consider that we have no backup SF."
idealreaddit,kind of expected noah to miss that
idealreaddit,"it's not split, this sub definitely favors hacking

idealreaddit,Why did you capitalize the first letter of every word in your last line
idealreaddit,just being realistic you dont have to get all mad
idealreaddit,"Not a better scorer, but a better offensive player yes, absolutely. He did lead the best offense in the NBA after all…"
idealreaddit,Yes. I still think Hawks will win. Just need to keep the ball moving. They got stagnant in the second half
idealreaddit,Doc doesn't get enough credit in general
idealreaddit,clippers aren't complaining at all. rockets complaining a lot
idealreaddit,Clippers bench outscored rockets bench last night
idealreaddit,Thunder-Spurs WCF Game 1 last year. Was cool but wasn't a close game
idealreaddit,because harden has made a career out of it and it annoys me
idealreaddit,"Blake: 25/13/6/1stls/1blks/3TOs on 51%

LeBron: 27/10/8/2/2/5 on 42%"
idealreaddit,Well damn aren't you a douche
idealreaddit,Lakers Austin Rivers flair? Wtf
idealreaddit,No it's a good point. 
idealreaddit,im drinking whiskey and dr pepper
idealreaddit,lmao you are an idiot
idealreaddit,classy spurs
idealreaddit,18 points on 54%? yea right
idealreaddit,some people dont like my comments
idealreaddit,so....what's your opinion on this now?
idealreaddit,hes gonna have a chris paul game 7-esque performance
idealreaddit,Doc Rivers
idealreaddit,thats a late fucking whistle.
idealreaddit,Cousins easily
idealreaddit,Riddick. That's a new one
idealreaddit,What the heck Jamal was 4-9? Is that real? I thought he was way worse
idealreaddit,Cavs
idealreaddit,Green got destroyed by Davis and now Randolph. Below average defender if we're being honest.
idealreaddit,"i pick ""those guys"" no contest"
idealreaddit,you mean 2nd?
idealreaddit,They'd lose to the Rockets in the first round
idealreaddit,He can be flashy if he wants to (we've seen it hundreds of times). That's not his style.
idealreaddit,We'll double Harden with JJ and someone else like always
idealreaddit,wtf
idealreaddit,he can still pass well at least
idealreaddit,cp3 got that call in game 7 vs spurs. didn't let him land. that's fair i guess. still flopped tho
idealreaddit,"Rockets will provide a tougher challenge than you would expect. I didn't respect them at all before our series (really, before game 5) but they are legit contenders for sure. They will challenge the Warriors.

Warriors in 7"
idealreaddit,lol curry is a choker
idealreaddit,"no they arent. certainly not ""by far"""
idealreaddit,Under
idealreaddit,No my math is right. 
idealreaddit,nothing better than bbq chips
idealreaddit,He said this same thing when Kaman pushed him during his 41/17 game.
idealreaddit,10
idealreaddit,He's not. 
idealreaddit,i'd love to see you argue that the team chris paul has is more talented than the bad boy pistons
idealreaddit,what did TT think he was doing there
idealreaddit,lol chanting mvp
idealreaddit,it's happened pretty much all post-season
idealreaddit,Noah was still not good defensively. 
idealreaddit,uh blake griffin definitely  has handles
idealreaddit,"/r/laclippers we love to give out upvotes to literally anyone who isn't a troll. 

Guess I misunderstood the question. "
idealreaddit,clippers have led the warriors in attendance each of last 4 seasons and i want warriors to move because they would be better off in vancouver
idealreaddit,It was a great trade. Monta Ellis sucks
idealreaddit,you're starting jason terry at pg lol what more needs to be said
idealreaddit,"1. Harden  
2. LeBron 
3. Kyrie 
4. Curry  
5. Thompson

This is for their regular season scoring, not post-season, right? Top regular season scorers by PPG still in the POs?"
idealreaddit,"No, there isn't. Could be Howard or Gasol"
idealreaddit,"Warriors- 40

Rockets- 15

Cavs-30

Hawks- 15"
idealreaddit,clippers
idealreaddit,CP3 and Cousins would be a nightmare
idealreaddit,"clippers in 7 vs warriors

warriors in 5 vs rockets"

idealreaddit,We'll win anyway
idealreaddit,You're asking reddit to stop fellating the golden boy? Lmao good luck
idealreaddit,Go Clippers!
idealreaddit,"love how harden didn't even look to get the bucket there on the fastbreak, just flopped for a foul

worst playstyle in the nba"
idealreaddit,Dellavedova thinking he's Austin Rivers
idealreaddit,Grizz need to figure out how to play offense this is awful
idealreaddit,It's not that tricky you're just slow. 
idealreaddit,"if by ""waking up"" you mean drawing ridiculous fouls, yea. He didn't shoot well"
idealreaddit,http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/sort/homePct
idealreaddit,"our offense was bad too. didnt show up. obviously not worried about this series at all, but i wanted to take this in 5 so these guys could get some rest."
idealreaddit,pretty dumb question
idealreaddit,FLOP CITY BITCH
idealreaddit,I'm rooting for the Warriors to lose. Really don't care outside of that. 
idealreaddit,"DJ has never been an all-star

let me just say you are absolute shitting all over this thread with your complete ignorance of the nba"
idealreaddit,whats with marcs jumper
idealreaddit,Who do I even compare to Griffin…there's no one like him at the PF position
idealreaddit,sounds like you know the clippers will send your warriors home just like last year
idealreaddit,thats not a foul when curry got in his way. should be a foul on curry
idealreaddit,Yea but it's not a huge difference. 
idealreaddit,Watch him sometime dumbass. 
idealreaddit,If you look at the numbers or watch them play it's very clear who has been better
idealreaddit,Probably every 3-8 weeks like any person…
idealreaddit,Clippers and Cavs
idealreaddit,"Blake was the much better player than LMA this season. That cannot be argued. He also played about the same number of games as Aldridge, that cannot be argued. Therefore he deserves all-NBA over Aldridge."
idealreaddit,"No. James, Durant, Paul, Griffin, Davis, Curry, Harden, George, Anthony, Westbrook

Would also take Gasol and Howard, possibly Butler and Irving as well as Kawhi, Love, and Bosh"
idealreaddit,houston floppers
idealreaddit,i fucking hate castle
idealreaddit,Lillard is constantly injured
idealreaddit,Matt Barnes is a player
idealreaddit,lmfao that isn't true at all
idealreaddit,blake is incredible
idealreaddit,grizzlies
idealreaddit,0%
idealreaddit,6 from jamal

Harden, Butler, Wade, Thompson, Matthews  
James, Durant, Melo, George, Leonard  
Griffin, Davis, Bosh, Aldridge, Love  
Gasol, Howard, Cousins, Jordan, Horford"
idealreaddit,this is what happens when warriors are forced to run their halfcourt sets
idealreaddit,"Austin over Jamal imo. 

Oh didn't see OP's description is he a UFA?"
idealreaddit,no i just never want the warriors to win anything
idealreaddit,WOW mirotic
idealreaddit,does he alienate gay people or something
idealreaddit,"I enjoyed Oblivion/Skyrim and played them both a fuckton although now those two games can't hold my attention for more than 15 minutes

Didn't like FO3/NV"
idealreaddit,curry stop acting like youre a good midrange shooter. youre not
idealreaddit,well you failed at that breh
idealreaddit,At least we didn't get Bill Kennedy. He honestly shouldn't even be allowed to ref doc-coached teams
idealreaddit,lol you are insecure
idealreaddit,No it doesn't
idealreaddit,Hawks and Bulls were both top 10 offenses. Celtics were better offensively than Grizz. Not a big difference. 
idealreaddit,just so you know that flair looks awful on you
idealreaddit,rockets defense is fucking terrible wow. our offense wasnt nearly this good *with chris paul* against spurs
idealreaddit,lebron cant shoot
idealreaddit,"Curry

lol this is apparently the one thread on /r/nba where you can say something positive about curry and get downvoted for it"
idealreaddit,He's a cancerous person so they fired him
idealreaddit,rofl
idealreaddit,"I think you guys are forgetting how bad of a matchup the clippers are for you…if you out Ariza on CP3, then that means Prigioni will have to guard JJ, plus Jones will be guarding Griffin, and Dwight and DJ will essentially cancel each other out. "
idealreaddit,Zbo isn't a great defender. 
idealreaddit,"because ""make your free throws"""
idealreaddit,thats a good sign
idealreaddit,Could've said the same for Hawes coming out of college. Top 10 pick
idealreaddit,considering theyve already gone 9 deep....
idealreaddit,"FUCK YEA

GG Spurs"
idealreaddit,memphis isnt capitalizing on warriors shitty play at all
idealreaddit,Don't worry he's not actually a Celtics fan. 
idealreaddit,Well I'm going to take the Clippers organization's word over anything else until we get something more definitive.
idealreaddit,guess harden is an average player if you combine his horrible defense with his stellar offense
idealreaddit,we win that game with even foul calls
idealreaddit,"They need to at least get rid of the stupid division rule and division tiebreaker. If that was gone it'd be Clippers, Rockets, Grizzlies, Spurs, Blazers."
idealreaddit,you're welcome to that opinion.
idealreaddit,SP3NC3R HAW3S
idealreaddit,Yep.
idealreaddit,"everyone got this high opinion of the rockets after they destroyed the mavs (who are really bad). sure part of it is that they're rusty, but they're really not all that good"
idealreaddit,"Clippers said it was an ankle sprain.

idealreaddit,Rockets. Fuck the Warriors.

idealreaddit,harden is the woooorst
idealreaddit,Go Rockets
idealreaddit,what the hell is with the downvotes
idealreaddit,Really hope he isn't on the team next season.
idealreaddit,Well you chose a weird comment to tell me that...nothing I said was odd
idealreaddit,first part of your username is accurate
idealreaddit,idealreaddit*
idealreaddit,It's painfully obvious to me that the majority of this sub does not watch a lot of basketball or only watch their team
idealreaddit,No he cannot.
idealreaddit,"Any time you have Kevin Love and he can't play due to injury, you're shorthanded."
idealreaddit,Get used to it. Nothing's going to change.
idealreaddit,What about them
idealreaddit,i was right because the clippers are way better than rockets
idealreaddit,No I didn't delete any comments.
idealreaddit,"19.5 for DJ miss vs 13 for not DJ miss

idealreaddit,"source being ""basketball forever"" on twitter

ok"
idealreaddit,michael jordan was never any good
idealreaddit,dagger
idealreaddit,Probably not but still people definitely watch it. Plus I don't really see how that's relevant to it being 3 days long
idealreaddit,"Bulls win in a close one

Clippers blow out Rockets"
idealreaddit,meh
idealreaddit,CP3 got the assist
idealreaddit,Lol right
idealreaddit,And they wanted a vacation when they blew the Clippers out game 3?
idealreaddit,Clippers beat writer
idealreaddit,holy fuck cp3 is fast
idealreaddit,according to nbasavant he took 324 midrange shots this season
idealreaddit,"Plus Curry plays in an extremely fast-paced offense, while CP3 played in the exact opposite, at the 3rd slowest pace in the NBA. NOLA used 90 possessions vs this year's Warriors using 100.7 possessions/game. Huge, huge difference"
idealreaddit,LOL. Warriors flair?
idealreaddit,"""Warriors 2014-15

A regular season team"""
idealreaddit,Simmons leaving Grantland is addition by subtraction.

idealreaddit,Thank goodness. 
idealreaddit,ok?
idealreaddit,"6 players in double figures, 4 with 15 or more, Harden triple double, Dwight with 15 rebs.....thats about as well as you will play"
idealreaddit,Yea it's hilariously pathetic
idealreaddit,Easy way to tell someone is a bandwagon fan
idealreaddit,Wouldn't even take Wall over Irving now
idealreaddit,Yes he can. Show me something they can do that Chris can't.
idealreaddit,no...
idealreaddit,Currys kid is so fucking ugly I can see why ESPN is upset
idealreaddit,oh hey there sjw
idealreaddit,if you get your info from /r/nba and bill simmons sure.
idealreaddit,rather play 4 games at staples center than 4 games at oracle. grizz
idealreaddit,i cant see your (incorrect) side
idealreaddit,Because it's not the highest level of achievement
idealreaddit,go clips let's get another win
idealreaddit,Gross
idealreaddit,yea
idealreaddit,nope go grizzlies
idealreaddit,Think it was a travel
idealreaddit,mo out for the game what even happened to him
idealreaddit,yes if dj doesnt get more fouls
idealreaddit,yes and we can go over the cap to re-sign him
idealreaddit,My b
idealreaddit,He sure is a Clippers hater
idealreaddit,lol warriors are a regular season team trying to draw regular season fouls
idealreaddit,god fuck you sage
idealreaddit,Nope. Not his fault
idealreaddit,Hell yes. Well deserved
idealreaddit,very true
idealreaddit,"Am I supposed to be offended? I know most of my comments are ""bad"". "
idealreaddit,curry tries way too hard to be flashy
idealreaddit,Isiah
idealreaddit,People underestimate just how strong he is. There's a reason he was able to hold his own defensively against KD in last year's playoffs. 
idealreaddit,Overrated. People get way too excited over triple doubles
idealreaddit,is this your first season watching the warriors
idealreaddit,why would ballmer move the insanely profitable clippers from the insanely profitable city of los angeles
idealreaddit,Elaborate?
idealreaddit,thanks dude it means a lot
idealreaddit,Don't be an asshole. No I'm not retarded
idealreaddit,Yea he is crazy athletic but he's not on that Griffin/Westbrook level anymore
idealreaddit,"Below average defense is a compliment. He also couldn't shoot and was not the playmaker that CP3 is, and was turnover-prone."
idealreaddit,it happens
idealreaddit,Guarantee he will bust
idealreaddit,dude you are the worst poster on here. stop being an asshole and start contributing positively to this community.
idealreaddit,"Was very confused, thought this was about Marc"
idealreaddit,might wanna do some research on what the downvote button is supposed to be used for
idealreaddit,Yep you're right. This is the first time we felt like we were favorites to advance to WCF. 
idealreaddit,why do you do this doc
idealreaddit,"You may be the most mad person I have ever seen here, holy shit your history is filled with you calling people fucking idiots. And you think Tyson Chandler is a better defensive player than DeAndre Jordan, which calls your NBA knowledge into question."
idealreaddit,Rockets in 6
idealreaddit,I agree that's why I wonder why /u/thepop said that
idealreaddit,i want a grizzlies clippers wcf
idealreaddit,curry is not the best pg in the nba
idealreaddit,"What incredibly one-sided ""analysis"""
idealreaddit,Both had much more complete games. Could actually shoot and play elite D.
idealreaddit,that needs to be on the front page of /r/nba now
idealreaddit,I don't think he's significantly better defensively. His defensive impact is hugely overstated and Blake is good defensively when he puts in the effort
idealreaddit,flair up puss
idealreaddit,Ugly face
idealreaddit,thanks bro
idealreaddit,Or at least unsubscribe
idealreaddit,I think Cleveland wins it
idealreaddit,dont think i prayed at all because praying is for retards
idealreaddit,well he made 159 with the warriors...
idealreaddit,lol bro whats with the clips hate. ive seen you on our sub with clips flair
idealreaddit,refs trying to win oakland this game
idealreaddit,"No he's not....he shoots over 40% from 3, passes well, and his high BBIQ"
idealreaddit,"best rebounder in the nba, elite defender, elite finisher at the rim, iron man, yet doesn't deserved the max...wow"
idealreaddit,....thats pretty much just TS%
idealreaddit,"curry, harden, james, love, kanter"
idealreaddit,no they would not
idealreaddit,no wins do not factor into per at all
idealreaddit,Fans everywhere do not boo literally everything
idealreaddit,HOLY FUCK HOW DO YOU CALL THAT SHIT
idealreaddit,Blaming this series loss on a guy who averaged 20/10 on 50/40/90 along with lockdown D in this series is utterly idiotic.
idealreaddit,NICE HANDS KLAY
idealreaddit,Curry can't get around screens
idealreaddit,What a dumb argument
idealreaddit,Fuck the Warriors
idealreaddit,I'm insane because my opinions don't align with yours? Gtfo
idealreaddit,go look at jeff greens numbers
idealreaddit,mad cuz bad
idealreaddit,"CP3 will defend Curry and do a great job on him as always...

Redick will guard Klay and will do a fine job

I think you should be more worried about who's guarding CP3."
idealreaddit,Too bad I don't get paid a shitload of money to spew shit like he does
idealreaddit,Go Grizzlies
idealreaddit,I agree with that
idealreaddit,Curry won
idealreaddit,Lol dude don't flatter yourself. I saw your comment while I was going through this thread. 
idealreaddit,damn warriors flop a ton
idealreaddit,"thats why i was confused. if i see ""gasol"" i automatically think marc"

idealreaddit,jeff green
idealreaddit,hack-a-shack is banned
idealreaddit,yes it is he shoots 36% from midrange
idealreaddit,"Duncan, Gasol, Conley, Howard"
idealreaddit,yes
idealreaddit,Even then that's far and away from a 1 seed. A good team who can maybe make the second round? Possibly. But a 1 seed? No way. Unless Embiid is the second coming of Hakeem

idealreaddit,these announcers are actively rooting for the warriors
idealreaddit,"per 100 possessions

CP3: 32.4/7.9/15.7/3.9stls + elite defense

Curry: 35.5/6.4/11.6/3.0stls + below average to average defense"
idealreaddit,I bet he comes to the Clippers as a defensive assistant. 
idealreaddit,it is absolutely retarded that harden has 9 fta in this half. you mean to tell me harden has taken more contact than blake?
idealreaddit,I've never deleted a comment
idealreaddit,"I don't hate the rockets, what are you talking about

and why the hell would the clippers hack harden?"
idealreaddit,duncan
idealreaddit,"dont forget his 4 TOs, commentary crrew

edit: 5"
idealreaddit,"He's better than Cousins, Aldridge, Wall, Kyrie (for now)"
idealreaddit,FUCK THE WARRIORS
idealreaddit,Can't rationalize Cousins over Jordan when Jordan played 23 more games.
idealreaddit,Against the Pels. Color me unimpressed
idealreaddit,"DJ doesn't even look to shoot, he just flops around looking for a call"
idealreaddit,chris paul
idealreaddit,"Houston is better than Atlanta yea

But Celts and Bulls are better than Pels and Grizz"
idealreaddit,"How big of a homer do you have to be to claim that Kyrie has better handles than CP3 and Crawford?

Educate yourself son, it's not even close."
idealreaddit,"""Roaracle"" quiet as fuck"
idealreaddit,Curry's better defensively than Westbrook. Neither are all that good
idealreaddit,Definitely
idealreaddit,Warriors complain so much
idealreaddit,Yep. Best performance of his career
idealreaddit,MOV is little too close but agreed.
idealreaddit,Well you have to take it into context…
idealreaddit,"Lol you're so bitter that CP3 beat your Spurs on one leg. Still think he's only ""above average""?"
idealreaddit,Well there goes his argument. 
idealreaddit,dont be a bitch
idealreaddit,"Ok, still not as good as Chris."
idealreaddit,haha that's funny
idealreaddit,all of it
idealreaddit,"oh, congrats then i guess"
idealreaddit,"yea thats weird to me, 6th in the reg season with howard missing a lot of time"
idealreaddit,Not Ian Eagle or JVG
idealreaddit,Yup. And the other ref was the new guy who called the basket interference on barnes and tech on chris
idealreaddit,Phil Jackson
idealreaddit,Their second round opponent was Clippers or Spurs they were done from the start
idealreaddit,lol salty warriors fans with the downhardens
idealreaddit,no he doesn't
idealreaddit,dude he mauled him. that was way worse than the jr smith punch
idealreaddit,over
idealreaddit,umad
idealreaddit,Whoever is doing the play-by-play
idealreaddit,It's been clearly him for a long time
idealreaddit,cavs
idealreaddit,"I think you're misinterpreting my comment. I meant that I don't think this is the first time an away team has been favored in game 7

In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs were favored in game 7 in our previous series."
idealreaddit,Yea I want Lester too. Good D and scoring ability. But he commits way too many unforced turnovers and the Rockets love to get out on the fast break...so I don't really know what would be the best option.
idealreaddit,nice flop dwight. learning from harden

idealreaddit,Yea idk how anyone can cheer for this guy or his teams when he is such a shitty person. Fuck Draymond Green.
idealreaddit,Who's better? Dirk has fallen off a bit
idealreaddit,you too right
idealreaddit,these are some dumbass TOs
idealreaddit,"Clippers vs Spurs in game 7. Not just the Clippers, both teams were insanely clutch and had role players hit some huge shots. "
idealreaddit,It wasn't a foul.
idealreaddit,"Exactly, he's the most inconsistent player I've ever seen. He goes from looking like MJ one game to looking like he doesn't even belong in the league in the next. And since he's been traded to Memphis those MJ-esque games have been few and far between"
idealreaddit,I'd put him over Westbrook easily
idealreaddit,uhhh no im not
idealreaddit,ok refs
idealreaddit,"My point was not to prove that Harden is an average player, but to show him that his logic for Allen being average was completely retarded.

But i'm sure you're too dumb to comprehend that"
idealreaddit,Good.
idealreaddit,Clippers would start JJ and let Harden be the 6th man
idealreaddit,Fucking motorcycle
idealreaddit,Couldn't keep Collison he wanted to start. 
idealreaddit,How is that on david griffin
idealreaddit,grizzlies still got this. a whole 90 seconds left
idealreaddit,i saw it
idealreaddit,Gotta go with the Clippers.
idealreaddit,"harden has made more than one chippy play after the play, yet hasn't gotten anything for it. ridiculous. is he sucking off the refs before every game?"
idealreaddit,"Cavs by 8  
Clippers by 27"
idealreaddit,"Even without hacking their FTA were in the 40-50 range

Plus DJ got hacked 3 times. I bet the free throw disparity was still around 20 attempts even when taking hacking into account"
idealreaddit,15 PT LEAD THIS GAME IS OVER
idealreaddit,I just read it as perimeter defender
idealreaddit,lol tony allen
idealreaddit,oh im ready lol
idealreaddit,100% sure you did not get banned for that
idealreaddit,I bet CP can still dunk. 
idealreaddit,"So how exactly is he a better point guard when chris paul consistently averages more assists and less turnovers, and consistently leads better offenses despite scoring less points? i'd love to hear your explanation.

I hear this shit a lot and it is straight disrespectful to one of the best floor generals the nba has ever seen."
idealreaddit,go grizz

idealreaddit,Dave Wohl is Clippers GM
idealreaddit,lol that is a terrible commercial. pretty funny though. don't see anything wrong with it...
idealreaddit,the refs were actually good in game 6
idealreaddit,it is beyond me how there is such a strong consensus in this thread that westbrook is better at basketball than curry.

themariokarters,John stop clapping bro lmao
themariokarters,let them fucking play 
themariokarters,/r/nba figured that out before the GMs did lol
themariokarters,What?!? Your team is a god damn joke bro. Bucks overachieved like hell
themariokarters,the JR Smith statline
themariokarters,Josh Smith is literally the antichrist 
themariokarters,the max.
themariokarters,the fucking disrespect 
themariokarters,they weren't keeping Bledsoe anyway
themariokarters,Lmfao that was amazing
themariokarters,"Ah yes, because Portland won their division but Memphis had a better record"
themariokarters,Jamal Crawford shouldn't even be out there at this point 
themariokarters,Damn that was a clean ass block
themariokarters,"Knicks 
Lakers
Sixers"
themariokarters,AT&amp;T broad looks so much hotter outside of those commercials 
themariokarters,"Because this is just you bitching about the refs, like every Bulls fan is doing in the game thread. It's nauseating "
themariokarters,someone explain why he didn't get tossed there? jeez I heard at least 3 fucks there
themariokarters,LMAOOOOO your posts make so much more sense now
themariokarters,Bulls in 6.
themariokarters,"Observations: ESPN production value is ass. Hawks stopped playing their brand of basketball in March and haven't gotten it back at all. Joey Crawford has been good. Beal, Otto, and Sessions look great. Pierce is the Truth."
themariokarters,Can't wait to see them boast about beating you guys 
themariokarters,"Nate kinda blows lmao not sure why everyone is on his nuts. Also, he's wearing a jacket and pants, not a suit "
themariokarters,lol does the crowd really wanna play games with Pierce? that never works out
themariokarters,Lebron's opting out and going back to Miami /s
themariokarters,I love you JR 
themariokarters,Lmfao ESPN got so bad 
themariokarters,Right dude? everyone jerking off to the highlights guy lol
themariokarters,Carmelo 
themariokarters,What the actual fuck?
themariokarters,Lmaooooo he completely gave up!
themariokarters,lmaooo same here man. it's the most excitement Knicks fans have had all season 
themariokarters,Sage Steele
themariokarters,never once heard of this lmao but that's pretty clever
themariokarters,"everyone between the ages of 18 and 20, sure. real men use mason jars"
themariokarters,Marv sucks. Thompson is the best rebounder in the NBA
themariokarters,Ariza can flat out stroke that thing. 
themariokarters,lol that was odd how he didn't even acknowledge houston
themariokarters,Great call by the ref. He was in
themariokarters,"like ""CAW CAW"" crow noise?"
themariokarters,"ABC, as is the case every single year"
themariokarters,we got some talented significant others on this sub damn
themariokarters,Houston in 7 behind a 25/15 series from Dwight 
themariokarters,Easily 
themariokarters,Gotta get JVG on DvM
themariokarters,You're really funny 
themariokarters,He was considered a bust way before this season ended 
themariokarters,"you haven't watched any/enough timberwolves games in the second half of the season. the kid has moves that will make you go ""???"""
themariokarters,"Right, but they'll likely be down 2-0 when he's back. Too late?"
themariokarters,Yo honest observation. Lebron yells at Mozgov A LOT. poor guy lol
themariokarters,"my only complaint with Mike Breen is he'll say ""waaaay off"" when someone misses"
themariokarters,trash talk triggered fuck the raptors 
themariokarters,WHAT AM I WATCHING
themariokarters,"Because the example used was Chris Paul and he was traded. I'm too lazy to put it into words more, but it made sense in my head lol"
themariokarters,"""now let's go to the sprint cut your bill in half time highlights"" ""we need a company that cuts all your bills in half"" he's literally said it for the past 3 ESPN/ABC halftime shows"
themariokarters,couple guys earlier in this game thread said exactly that 
themariokarters,"it's not really that hard to say. it's probably the easiest call, actually. they don't get out of that first round series without Blake playing like this"
themariokarters,What a guy
themariokarters,"He is a top 3 center, and I personally find him hilarious"
themariokarters,Dwight fouled him. 
themariokarters,"Yes, but while the Rockets and Cavs rely on penetration, GSW does not"
themariokarters,"I don't know what that means, but I say it because Schroeder really reminds me of TP when he was younger "
themariokarters,Yes. Unbearable 
themariokarters,"not at all. the other 29 teams aren't moving to SF, but we see this across the league. more to do with enormous TV revenues. Also leave it to Rovell to talk about stupid shit like this in the middle of a second round game"
themariokarters,"Look at Pistons pick and Cavs kicking them out from last year, basically "
themariokarters,Who the fuck is that
themariokarters,"Right, but triple doubles in a game 7 by a forward since 1992 kind of is. Monster performance by Blake regardless "
themariokarters,... how is that something you need to review?
themariokarters,Deadspin needs to stop existing 
themariokarters,Refs got money on the spread 
themariokarters,"You will get downvoted, but you are absolutely correct. Same principle applies to heat-checks"

themariokarters,? he called someone an ugly Shaun Livingston I don't get it
themariokarters,That last shot was fucking great 
themariokarters,HILARIO!!
themariokarters,"Holy shit it's the Grizzlies ""COME ON!!"" woman again I'm out "
themariokarters,"D Rose sucks after 1 day rest, doesn't suck after 2 days rest"
themariokarters,"TV ratings would be shit, league wouldn't allow that"
themariokarters,didn't look like he got hit lol
themariokarters,"Mike Gasol. Yup, that's the one "
themariokarters,mocking them fouling Dwight..
themariokarters,lol it's a joke. Kenny didn't actually do any of this. just went back and filmed the security camera stuff 
themariokarters,"Also worth noting Kobe missed game 3 because of the injury and the Pacers won that game. Jalen admitted it ""wasn't by accident"" on a Jalen &amp; Jacoby episode "
themariokarters,"Damn. I can't find anything good online, really wanna bet on a draw"
themariokarters,what about the technical foul suspension?
themariokarters,Stop trying to fit out and fit in!
themariokarters,wow lol must be nice to have a backup Steph
themariokarters,Did you really just say pretending to mix a salad?
themariokarters,"""his mom's pretty cute too"""

themariokarters,"Serious question, isn't that a slavery reference?"
themariokarters,Eject Teague. also fuck Steve Javie
themariokarters,Fire that man. 
themariokarters,Love is literally a white James Jones on this team. They don't use him any differently 
themariokarters,He always supports whichever team is down. Relax
themariokarters,Pau stole Marc's jumper
themariokarters,Lebron was beyond off but Butler did a great job on him
themariokarters,Are you 12?
themariokarters,"It's alright, y'all got Halanzo Whitemournside"
themariokarters,"he's using a hookah (got the foil and the coals on there) which is used predominately for tobacco. it's not a crazy question. but, yeah, it seems like he's smoking weed out of it lol"
themariokarters,"2015 will forever be remembered as ""The J Smith Playoffs"""
themariokarters,Bahahaha
themariokarters,BS for BS 
themariokarters,you're missing the joke here 
themariokarters,She's so sexy
themariokarters,and im saying that's an idiotic interpretation 
themariokarters,10 point Kyrie run... that'll do
themariokarters,hell yes.
themariokarters,Go gay for Mudiay
themariokarters,The votes were cast before that. Cut this silly shit out 
themariokarters,i just vomited from how sick that was
themariokarters,Can't wait to see Embiid battle it out with this year's class for ROY personally
themariokarters,Adam Silver is one well-spoken bloke
themariokarters,if he says BANG again I'm turning my TV off
themariokarters,wtf
themariokarters,Which is why i said I'd put him #2 lol
themariokarters,Relax. But yes lol
themariokarters,What...? Who said you have to harm someone to get hate?
themariokarters,"That's kinda true actually. Didn't see it either though, not a fan of the propaganda genre"
themariokarters,"Lmaoooo his face ""agh fuck"""
themariokarters,And there we have it lmao
themariokarters,OHHH MEE OHH MYYYY
themariokarters,It is also against company policy to appear on company shows without the company knowing. Company.
themariokarters,why's it look like everyone's got some white shit in their hair?
themariokarters,"CP3 apparent injury is heartbreaking, but Blake Griffin is way too talented to not give them a shot here"
themariokarters,you're not beating the Cavs
themariokarters,lol okay buddy
themariokarters,LLLLLOOOOOYDDDDDD
themariokarters,it's RIP Rockets either way if JET is guarding him
themariokarters,He's not 1st team tho lmao
themariokarters,"""H-Town my second home like I'm James Harden"""
themariokarters,you can actually see the fog buildup on his mask.. damn
themariokarters,HOLY SHIT
themariokarters,LOL WOW that was a whole new level of product placement 
themariokarters,"I knew someone would say this haha. Leonard and Duncan were their stars, super is subjective "
themariokarters,That's an idiotic interpretation 
themariokarters,RINGS CHUCK. FOUR RINGS. CHUCK.
themariokarters,"This is real, not imaginary "
themariokarters,Cleveland defense is so bad... bench is bad too. Bulls in 6?
themariokarters,I'm actually a bit sad lol
themariokarters,grabbed at his hamstring and went to the locker room
themariokarters,has anyone tried the sprite lebron mix?
themariokarters,Outback Jesus is going in on that mouthpiece a la Curry
themariokarters,How can you say that as a Timberwolves fan? Your entire starting line up was ravaged by injuries
themariokarters,"Mama, there goes your son. "
themariokarters,https://vine.co/v/eZzFYJHtLb5
themariokarters,"lol Steph's mother is such a fox, coincidently the only one with a father in the NBA "
themariokarters,Lmao I love this one. WCW 
themariokarters,Outback Jesus &gt; One Legged Uncle Drew
themariokarters,Tony Allen is not Courtney Lee. Is that enough explanation lol
themariokarters,We've been had
themariokarters,I'm just saying the FG % means just about nothing because of how few shots there were
themariokarters,Wizards will not throw away 2 games like Brooklyn did. Sorry ATL
themariokarters,Cavs in 6
themariokarters,Needs more Sonya
themariokarters,"Fuck Draymond Green, but he is a hell of a two way player"

themariokarters,cannot stand Lewis Johnson 
themariokarters,Cavs vs Lakers to open the season should be fun!
themariokarters,Fucking Hardaway Jr had to win those fucking games at the end of the season. FUCK ME
themariokarters,Best episode of Iron Chef ever

themariokarters,NBA is BOLD
themariokarters,Lmao keep gettin them checks Jalen

themariokarters,The Lil B curse is REAL
themariokarters,he's been called underrated so much that he's just rated now
themariokarters,I want to punch that dude from that McDonald's commercial in the face 
themariokarters,he wasn't even recording! and he didn't take the picture lmao just held up the phone 
themariokarters,you're a clown. Warriors took years to develop 
themariokarters,"Doris just said so much false shit, I don't even know where to start "
themariokarters,Home court disadvantage 
themariokarters,Rockets vs. ESPN
themariokarters,how the fuck is there not an update on CP yet?
themariokarters,"Bye bye, Tom"
themariokarters,Over AND back dude 
themariokarters,Definitely a shot at Jalen Rose for what he did to Kobe. Guess there isn't really love between them as Jalen says 
themariokarters,"I'd take the horse over Sage, guy is funny"
themariokarters,In the penalty*
themariokarters,"Yup, pretty much all season. A few of our guys did pretty well with it (Galloway, Jason Smith) and others not so much (JR Smith)"
themariokarters,how long till Bogut elbows Conley in the face?
themariokarters,"Yeah you're right, my bad lol"
themariokarters,Curry looks awful. Can we sue the dumbass who cleared him to play for malpractice?
themariokarters,you can't be considered a rookie in the NBA if you've played a second of a regular season NBA game. 
themariokarters,paging /u/rabsho 
themariokarters,Let's do it 
themariokarters,I like it 
themariokarters,she hasn't been the same since Floyd banned her from the fight
themariokarters,Rasheed has the most technical fouls in NBA history. Pretty sure Shaq leads in flagrants. 
themariokarters,God I love when they get the rebound off the second miss. Fuck you Pop
themariokarters,*falls back*
themariokarters,Classic mixup. Dwight got the sativa 
themariokarters,"""joke"" "
themariokarters,Jason Terry Jones
themariokarters,Adjust for inflation and maybe I'll give a shit
themariokarters,What the hell happened to Lebron's jump shot?
themariokarters,Dell fixed his hairline.. kind of
themariokarters,LMAO DAWG HAHAHAHAH
themariokarters,That's exactly what the graphic ESPN put up in the last game (three times) said
themariokarters,"That seems logical, yes"
themariokarters,they completely gave up
themariokarters,"This, I like this "
themariokarters,"Eh you know, just the rasusual "
themariokarters,Oh my god that series was fucking awful 
themariokarters,"""He not legend"""
themariokarters,Hell yeah free ferries were too clutch back in high school
themariokarters,why the fuck are they still fouling?
themariokarters,Sonya :(
themariokarters,that was pathetic lol
themariokarters,"Mama, there goes that man!"
themariokarters,Fucking TNT didn't even show us the pass to the Howard dunk. DeAndre's face was clearly more important 
themariokarters,not really.. home court had nothing to do with any of those games
themariokarters,they surprised me with how awful they were vs Brooklyn lol
themariokarters,I cannot stand her
themariokarters,lmao. they straight up leave him in the corner

themariokarters,Wow. You are extremely talented
themariokarters,Stop posting here
themariokarters,Splash trifecta
themariokarters,it's the microphones at Barclays
themariokarters,you can make the same argument for your team 
themariokarters,Literally same here. Fuck me. 
themariokarters,Randy Whiteman
themariokarters,That was real
themariokarters,HAY KLAY CAN YOU HEAR THIS
themariokarters,"Doris, for the second time, said Curry shot 2-11 last game. That was from 3; he was 6-26. It's not that complicated "
themariokarters,Gasol going for a 30/15 game
themariokarters,I see absolutely no reason for him to play before June 4th (or 2nd?)
themariokarters,welcome to east coast playoffs
themariokarters,Oh now that is fucking dope
themariokarters,"Lmaooo this actually made me laugh, well done"
themariokarters,unfortunately this didn't actually say WWE like I thought it did. that's a bummer 
themariokarters,Koasty Koofy!
themariokarters,Harden is 3 bad passes away from having the most turnovers in NBA postseason history.. wow
themariokarters,"face is whatever, body is flames emoji"
themariokarters,"so did everyone, including the Clippers "
themariokarters,shit is trash
themariokarters,he wanted to save them. 
themariokarters,"Techs are at the discretion of the referee, so yup, they were"

themariokarters,Look I'm all for exposing the Hawks but don't bring your disgrace of a team into this 
themariokarters,I blame Reggie for all of this
themariokarters,Golden State's coaching staff is the best in the league. They are so damn good at making adjustments and putting out good line ups
themariokarters,You bet. 
themariokarters,"Maybe, just maybe, he's a basketball fan?"
themariokarters,Larry David tryna take out Lebron lol
themariokarters,His career is finnish 
themariokarters,Neither did Lebron
themariokarters,"No. Trade Crawford, keep DJ, and get a SF"
themariokarters,Because Washington played some fantastic defense
themariokarters,And how much weight exactly have the Rockets lost?
themariokarters,Holy shit is that the mother of dragons in the terminator movie?
themariokarters,A draw
themariokarters,Hundo p
themariokarters,So Memphis could have less time for their shot..
themariokarters,Took me a long ass time to realize you were being sarcastic lol
themariokarters,what the fuck ever man lmao 
themariokarters,Mahcus. 
themariokarters,they also both have cocks. pretty interesting 
themariokarters,Just floor burn for Conley right?
themariokarters,Kind of lol. Last two years we saw more of him on commercials than on the court in the playoffs
themariokarters,I've said before he isn't even the most valuable player on his team. That would be Bogut.
themariokarters,lol this one's funny
themariokarters,I have not. Will watch in next break 
themariokarters,"he's not annoyed, he's fucking hyped"
themariokarters,March*
themariokarters,This game is nowhere near over until the buzzer ends. Not when you got a dude who dropped 37 in a quarter on your team
themariokarters,"Why, oh why, is Josh Smith in the game?"
themariokarters,"just cancel the playoffs, time to go home. too many injuries "
themariokarters,Classic Plaschke
themariokarters,That was Marv.
themariokarters,Lebron is shooting 11% from three this series 
themariokarters,Hell yeah
themariokarters,"Nene, right on fucking cue. Holy shit. "
themariokarters,that would be an honor and a privilege
themariokarters,Yeah I know lmao it makes no sense
themariokarters,Maybe /r/warriors might give a shit?
themariokarters,Wow. What a quality guy 
themariokarters,I know he did. just saying it didn't look like it from the angle they showed initially 
themariokarters,"""@jalenrose tell bill i heard him"""
themariokarters,"Tough to say, the details really got lost in translation from the Congolese language"
themariokarters,"Carmelo doesn't get calls and is one of the best at getting his own rebound, so those numbers are naturally going to be deceptively low."
themariokarters,I AM APALLED SKIP BAYLESS
themariokarters,"Clippers look like utter trash right now, wow "
themariokarters,Pero Antic can stroke that thing 
themariokarters,Dawg he has no kids lmao people are so gullible 
themariokarters,"Tim ""What's a tie? I only win"" Duncan "
themariokarters,Because he's a shrewd businessman 
themariokarters,I refuse to continue reading Nate Silver's NBA pieces. Stick to the election
themariokarters,"we were the two seed with the scoring champ, reigning DPOY, and the 6th man two seasons ago tho lol"
themariokarters,Hmm well yes Mozgov is technically a former Knick lol

themariokarters,Deadspin is utter shit
themariokarters,"the lockout will cut that season in about half, but they should start talking about it "
themariokarters,idk man ask /r/standanddeliver
themariokarters,That's venture capital doe
themariokarters,that didn't really change my opinion of Doc. Bill's just being a good Celtics homer 
themariokarters,Kanye had Wittman drop him from the team
themariokarters,This is retarded lol. Memphis fans are delusional if they think Conley coming back is going to magically win the series 
themariokarters,ESPN did not know he was going on. 
themariokarters,I know. He/the city of Cleveland is so fortunate the refs didn't see it
themariokarters,4 in 6 years. Thibs couldn't figure him out (beat him in Boston too)
themariokarters,lmao this sub blows sometimes
themariokarters,"They said on TNT that Lebron's mom would get her nails done at some place in Ohio, and that she saw this place with the chamber at the same plaza and recommended it to her son. It's nothing that anyone can't do "
themariokarters,What the... hell am I watching 
themariokarters,Hell fucking damn right motherfucker
themariokarters,What are some of the weird questions about the NBA you've always wanted to ask and would like some other people here to answer?
themariokarters,Conley/Randolph and Dragic/Bosh come to mind 
themariokarters,Two bitches at the same time
themariokarters,Otto bounds ahahaha
themariokarters,Bulls playing like the 2012 Bulls
themariokarters,Ballstreams 720p 60 fps 1 second behind live TV. can't beat it
themariokarters,Crackheads can't dunk!
themariokarters,How the fuck is everyone mad that they said it WASNT a dirty play? Y'all make no sense lol
themariokarters,how has Draymond not gotten T-ed up?
themariokarters,Seriously though. he is the best shooter we have ever seen
themariokarters,It kind of was dude. Cleveland led at no point in their home floor - that's a blow out 
themariokarters,I do it all the time accidentally on my phone
themariokarters,maybe. gotta catch that after inside
themariokarters,"that's 1 out of 8 series that ended ""on time"" how does it not make sense to you?"
themariokarters,how do all these 15 year olds get mad good tickets to the games?
themariokarters,Harden take care of the ball man
themariokarters,"prepare yourselves for ""lemmuh tellyuh summin man they a jumpshootin team"" at the half "
themariokarters,get ballstreams 
themariokarters,Jeff Green can't get any more playing time 
themariokarters,Antic and Gortat could pass for brothers
themariokarters,Carmelo's injury / us not getting the first pick next week lol
themariokarters,it really is trash
themariokarters,im being facetious 
themariokarters,"when people on this sub ask if non-all stars are better then Melo, like once a week at least "
themariokarters,Off winning an Emmy
themariokarters,Yes but mobile big dudes are still less mobile than mobile smaller dudes 
themariokarters,"Yeah, it is"
themariokarters,I'm tellin you bruh 
themariokarters,Yup that's a decent bet 
themariokarters,GOAT
themariokarters,Because he is?
themariokarters,All the product he uses in his hair
themariokarters,Doris said concussion. That's not true. Jesus Christ do your job
themariokarters,Bruhhhhhhh come on!
themariokarters,He has a torn shoulder dude. No point in risking sitting out there (like Carmelo not wanting to fuck up his knee by someone running into it). He was out there for game 4 vs. Boston
themariokarters,You're awesome
themariokarters,Fight of the century &gt; biggest game of the season 
themariokarters,"Thank you, Captain Obvious"
themariokarters,"that's fine, but just.. look lol"
themariokarters,Can we replace Kenny with Bill Simmons?
themariokarters,Molly water*
themariokarters,Four
themariokarters,It is
themariokarters,Holy shit. Those are actually gang signs lmao
themariokarters,you just answered your own question. defense.
themariokarters,Marv continues to disappoint in these playoffs
themariokarters,ummm not the hero ball TNT is talking about. Good old give the ball to CP3 and Blake did the trick tho
themariokarters,you got my signature 
themariokarters,Which is less than how long game 6 was... 
themariokarters,Pretty spot on. 
themariokarters,Good lord

themariokarters,Ernuh I been sayin you cannat win a chammienship shootin jumpuhs
themariokarters,Washington's big men have been fucking pathetic

themariokarters,That's awesome hahaha
themariokarters,LMAO ANOTHER RIMJOB
themariokarters,"they don't give a fuck. these are money fans, not ""this is my team"" fans"

themariokarters,No whey
themariokarters,Jalen Rose is not Bruce Bowen
themariokarters,Carmelo. this is disrespect 
themariokarters,Dwight is so damn awful in the post. That's not your game man
themariokarters,Literally this
themariokarters,"I looked him up. he's a CFA charter holder who temporarily worked for an NBA team. very impressive, but he's a finance guy. how do we define an NBA analyst? ESPN's definition is probably way different "
themariokarters,....? what is your team then?
themariokarters,git yer own jahlil okafor 
themariokarters,I'm gonna go cry now 
themariokarters,NO ANYTHING BUT BRUNO MARS 
themariokarters,"Yeah you're right, it's been a whole 12 hours "

themariokarters,see: Bulls front office
themariokarters,ESPN accidentally almost gave credit to Memphis there
themariokarters,Lamarcus Gasoldridge over here 
themariokarters,some of them are not that bad

themariokarters,"Serge Ibaka: ""My uncle always told me, play like you have a log in your pants."""
themariokarters,Refs didn't see it
themariokarters,Draymond you little fucker
themariokarters,for some reason I can't get the image of Tom Thibodeau committing Harakiri at center court post-game if they lose out of my head
themariokarters,"Again, I urge everyone in this thread to head over to /r/curry to take part in the first ever Reddit subreddit hostile takeover "
themariokarters,"I'm illustrating a point, which you understood. Replace Lou with Jason Smith then"
themariokarters,LMAO okay Mark Jackson that was a good one 
themariokarters,it's still the first fucking quarter lmao this is obnoxious 
themariokarters,Thompson has been huuuuge this series
themariokarters,Got it. Same principle applies to the Lakers pick I guess?
themariokarters,Harden has been torching Klay all series 
themariokarters,Kyle Lowry
themariokarters,LETS GOOOOOOO

themariokarters,7 fucking shots in game 1. Game 2 was winnable but they lost for other shitty coaching decisions. You guys should have lost that series 
themariokarters,apparently Timmy is the GOAT at (paint) ballin too
themariokarters,Yup he's been lousy since the trade

themariokarters,they are all sold out. try stubhub.com for non-regular prices
themariokarters,Lebron eating. Literally 
themariokarters,Crack will do that to ya

themariokarters,"No, but they could *have*"
themariokarters,"This needs to happen, with Shaq narrating "
themariokarters,He also only lost games where the other team scored more points than his team. Pretty fucking crazy 
themariokarters,Aw :)
themariokarters,Yeah... I don't know if Mudiay can play the 5 quite yet
themariokarters,"Dope. I'm drinking some local craft beer, not cuz im mad, but this is a good game "
themariokarters,This is gonna be awful. I'm excited lol
themariokarters,"well, no shit. If I'm Doc he sits "
themariokarters,It's 100% not bone damage

themariokarters,try just a bit harder 
themariokarters,You have never posted in a thread you didn't make. What the fuck
themariokarters,"Yeah I realized that but the way he phrased it made it sound like ""Ricky"" and ""Gary"" have the same amount of letters lol"
themariokarters,that was a hell of a block
themariokarters,So many downvotes lmao. Like I said.. Woodson did throw him under the bus. But Udrih is still taking shots 2 years later which isn't really necessary
themariokarters,Every single game this series has had a 12-16 point lead and then ends up tied up. People bitch so much man just enjoy the game
themariokarters,having our first round pick for the first time since ever
themariokarters,"He's 29, he'd be leaving a lot of money on the table if he took a max this summer. Which would be great for whatever team got him, to be honest "

themariokarters,Clearly you didn't watch him play
themariokarters,"Really lmao? The dude listed two players who have no place in this discussion. if one of them made sense, i would have said he's 50% right. try to tell me to try to disagree without being a dick next time without being a dick next time. "
themariokarters,Cannot wait for TT to get into Draymond's head. Dude is a monster 
themariokarters,That is not a suit lol. I am getting down voted by people who don't know the difference between a suit and a jacket and trousers lmao
themariokarters,Nice crossdaddy from Curry
themariokarters,Warriors
themariokarters,Kinda curious why Shumpert hasn't been on Teague all series. We always had him guard the other team's best player

themariokarters,Yo you're trolling everyone right? your posts this past week have been hysterical 
themariokarters,"He already said Rockets, but yup, forgot about Detroit"

themariokarters,now we just need a quick GSW comeback so ZBo can bank in the game winning jumper
themariokarters,"Great, he's healthy and working out, you prick"
themariokarters,that man has seen some shit
themariokarters,Shaq has to shut up for real tho lol
themariokarters,Oh so that's why Portland got the 4th seed
themariokarters,I'm not one to judge haha. I can only hope there's bars in Memphis creating Joergerbombs
themariokarters,Mike Breen even thought he was Curry for like 30 seconds there last night 
themariokarters,this makes absolutely no sense for me from the Kings' perspective. 
themariokarters,"I think you're being generous. He's been not Tayshaun Prince, but this guy was supposed to fill a lot of holes for your team. Hasn't happened"
themariokarters,Brewer is excited 
themariokarters,"There are clearly exceptions as people have pointed out, but for the most part, he's right "
themariokarters,Tanking doesn't work in the playoffs

themariokarters,The net didn't move on that Ariza shot 
themariokarters,/r/photoshopbattles and /r/hailcorporate too lmao
themariokarters,I would commit harakiri 
themariokarters,"Nah man, I straight up put ""NBA strong side weak side"" into Google and got a (simple) answer in 10 seconds"

themariokarters,.. a lot of people
themariokarters,OHHHH BABY
themariokarters,That's a JR Smith move
themariokarters,done deal 
themariokarters,Lebron has suffered about 5 injuries this postseason that would end people's seasons. Stop worrying about him - he is an absolute freak of everything nature is 
themariokarters,Lmao Shaq. he's right tho. Wizards name has got to go
themariokarters,"I, too, would have a threesome with them"
themariokarters,Did this dude just say Wilt Bynum or am I bugging
themariokarters,are you kidding me ref?
themariokarters,Matthew Dellavedova just became the first player in NBA history to score 15 points replacing Kyrie Irving in the United Center

themariokarters,"but we get Coach ""Coach"" Collins and Sage ""someone please feed me"" Steele"
themariokarters,That's your opinion. Two seasons do not make a guy the best player in the world
themariokarters,can't tell if he's being sarcastic?
themariokarters,because... it was lmao. we weren't tanking back then 
themariokarters,Nene vs Noah would be the best washed up big man battle ever
themariokarters,Yeah he is. At shooting man. There's more to basketball than shooting. Beal is better at every other aspect of the game

themariokarters,Keep getting them checks Steve Javie. literally adds nothing 
themariokarters,You can only have 1 loss facing elimination lol
themariokarters,What is Chris Pau's status?
themariokarters,that's really unfortunate

themariokarters,"Should be Perkins to keep TT coming off the bench, but still a necessary move"
themariokarters,LMAOOOOO
themariokarters,"Well dude, do you think you get better looks playing with Lebron James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving, or Lou Amundson, Andrea Bargnani, and Langston Galloway? I personally love his success, but don't lose sight of him being the same old JR (he attempted 17 threes in one game, precisely because no one else could score)"

themariokarters,"Kerr and Curry both said he did a concussion test, how can he come back from that?"
themariokarters,"Yes, yes it does"

themariokarters,They're not jokes. He's outcoaching the COTY
themariokarters,"I dunno if you caught it just now, but Jon Barry said 6-26 again"
themariokarters,"Lousy tweet. He's joining Isiah Thomas, Matt Winer, and someone else who I forget. Maybe C Webb? Not ""the guys"""

themariokarters,I'm not getting between /u/goran_dragic and /u/martinsek lol

themariokarters,Nice condescending title bro
themariokarters,DMo would be so huge in this series if he were healthy man

themariokarters,"they're usually live, but you could be right. Bill's also a Clippers season ticket holder, so who knows "
themariokarters,"Yeah, it is. I guess I'm in the minority in thinking a blowout doesn't only mean a 30 point loss. "
themariokarters,"Props to Dwight for demanding to stay in all series after 3 fouls, getting the 3rd on Bogut is big"
themariokarters,his whole face is mad weird lol
themariokarters,well that was pathetic 
themariokarters,There is no discussion to have here. He's a 100% lock
themariokarters,what exactly did they do to deserve it?
themariokarters,thought that shit was gonna fall down

themariokarters,*BUZZER*
themariokarters,"Cue the ""Harden disappears when it matters"" narrative in 3...2..."
themariokarters,It's worth jack shit buddy 
themariokarters,"That is true, but between the fans in the arena booing Joe Johnson, chanting ""Paul Pierce sucks"", and the shit you guys say in these game threads, it's way more than any other fan base (save for the Raptors, and maybe the Warriors)"
themariokarters,No clue dude lmao
themariokarters,"Kyrie, Shumpert, ?? (seriously, ?!!?!), Lebron, Mozgov"
themariokarters,"He really can't tho lol dude sprains his ankle, bangs knees, and it's like nothing happened "
