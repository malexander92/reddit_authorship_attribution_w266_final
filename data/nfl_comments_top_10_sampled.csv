-Butt-Fumble-,"Just look at his name, just report and move on"
-Butt-Fumble-,You learn your place fish!
-Butt-Fumble-,He's still just a troll
-Butt-Fumble-,:( you make me sad
-Butt-Fumble-,Thank god we had an elite secondary in Wilfork to help us win that game
-Butt-Fumble-,"Born into a Pats family (family from Boston, no team up here) and trust me.. it's great.. but sometimes..."
-Butt-Fumble-,"So Cool Joe would have an adjusted career passer rating of ~116?

That doesn't sound right"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Because that's my whole point! Luck is involved with everything!

The bounce catch in the last SB, the helmet catch, the Welker drop. Unexpected shit happens in every game"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'll never get off!
-Butt-Fumble-,Holy shit that Parker dudes forearms
-Butt-Fumble-,If you don't think Montana would've done that in this age of the game you'd be damn surprised
-Butt-Fumble-,I mean I guess you don't but where can you find a Reebok Bledsoe Jersey in Canada?
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; guitar, bass, uke, banjo

Those 4 are the same and you know it! I used to teach all of those!

As well as mandolin, piano, tuba, alto sax, bass clarinet &amp; trumpet

Always wanted to learn the harmonica though!"
-Butt-Fumble-,My salt levels are rising
-Butt-Fumble-,"Literally all of those are dumb imo

At least mine celebrates something great in our history and terrible in yours

Yours are just have to do with us"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup without any postseasons it'd be 

Marino &gt; Peyton &gt; Elway &gt; Young &gt; Brady &gt; Favre &gt; Montana for me

But instead the postseason is the most important part so the list tends to be pretty different"
-Butt-Fumble-,I forgive him &lt;3
-Butt-Fumble-,*I mean* you aren't wrong
-Butt-Fumble-,You take that back dammit!
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I know, and the Broncos were a huge % last offseason too

I still won't label them all as 'Brady haters'"
-Butt-Fumble-,It's my trademark and there's kind of a funny secret behind them
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya people are severely underrated how good Mett looked

Playing on the worst team in the league but still had a passer rating almost exactly like Bridgewater and ahead of Carr. He had promise and then they took a guy to replace him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Don't warp my text man, I'm saying young Packers fans, a lot of the fans in general never watched Favre in the 90s or even early 2000s much

I've seen *so* many say 'They both have one ring and Rodgers dominates the stats' as if that now is all that matters. Favre was the best leader in the league for a long time, he could fire a drive into action like no one else could"
-Butt-Fumble-,"And a great O-line

If Geno doesn't look great you guys *need* to move on"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I've literally showed a user on here a picture of my Bledsoe jersey and he said 'How do I know you just didn't buy that recently?'

There's no reasoning with some people! We're all bandwagoners who aren't as good fans as them because our team has had great success recently"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Haven't gotten to see a mention of /r/Patriots2 in a while, glad to know we're back to that :("
-Butt-Fumble-,"Kelce is by no means a scrub. Like I said I think he's the 4th best in the league, and you could argue him at #2 too

I can't wait for more people to know his name. Too many people focus on flashy TE's who are good for fantasy like Graham and Orange"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's a fantastic slot CB but he kinda sucks everywhere else. I think this is a fair contract. Just wish he didn't go to a rival. He's gonna be great for covering Hilton &amp; Edelman, two of the biggest AFC threats to the Ravens"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Once you understand that people outside of America don't spell it with an s, I will take you seriously"
-Butt-Fumble-,I want to see just this seen without having to sit through an entire 'new Sandler' movie
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh seriously? I only ever noticed it much on him
-Butt-Fumble-,Did you miss that amazing 18 yard run?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Omg Spaz! They have proof you dorito dink! They have those super clear and damning text messages from months prior!

You're just a blind homer. Now time for the division rivals to give us their unbiased opinions ^/s"
-Butt-Fumble-,Honestly considering the talent around him you could 100% argue him anywhere with the rookies. He had the least amount of help
-Butt-Fumble-,Depending on the thread you say this in it might not be unpopular
-Butt-Fumble-,"I agree it's not likely

But the thing with the Browns/Bengals is being overplayed a lot. Both did improve their team a little. But last year they played the South divisions. This year they're playing the NFC West and AFC West, that 7-9 record could easily drop to 3-13 or 4-12 despite improvements"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yes but there were 8 AFL teams in your '68-'69 season

That's why it's still counted as a Super Bowl victory"
-Butt-Fumble-,I didn't put him over those guys though? If he has another insane season though I'd be tempted to put him at #1
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah Eli had a good year

But if you wanted to rank the 2014 QBs and you said Eli over Luck/Wilson/Rivers you'd be flamed *hard*

If you said QBR at all you'd get a million people saying QBR is stupid

But because I said that now I'm some asshole who's dismissing entire points? The point is QBR is fucking stupid"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. That's how most Pats fans feel. Ask em how they felt about Bountygate before and after this 'scandal'

It's one thing to look at this happening to another team. When it's yours it's a whole different ball game"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Let's be honest, she'll probably still get off pretty good compared to if she successfully got Winston in court"
-Butt-Fumble-,Ya I'll swallow my pride and take that easily
-Butt-Fumble-,4 SB's to 3 loses kinda
-Butt-Fumble-,"Everyone loves a good leg lock

But Mr.Harris is scum and people like him are why it took Ontario forever to legalize mma and why NY still doesn't have it

I hope he never fights in the UFC again"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Great *for a 6th round rookie on a terrible team*

He has a lot of potential with the right coach imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,A guy like Gronk might if he finds out we got stronger beer here
-Butt-Fumble-,"No reason to attack the Ravens man, they've got a lot of great players on their roster"
-Butt-Fumble-,/u/The_Other_Manning he'd pick you over his own QB
-Butt-Fumble-,"/r/NFL for one. There's a reason Jameis went #1 overall. Most people have confidence in his ability

Actually he's being called the best prospect since Luck"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*booo* that's lame

I still want my 'Mexico' #7 Falcons jersey"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He'll honestly be our #3 most likely

Which I don't expect him to be that bad at"
-Butt-Fumble-,Well I'm glad to see we're being open minded
-Butt-Fumble-,"There was also a time the Falcons &amp; Browns were supposed to lose their 1st round draft picks this year right?

I'll wait for the official punishment"
-Butt-Fumble-,Here in Toronto that bandwagon died *fast*
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh okay, that's a decent hit then. But with the addition of Graham that should make up for it imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,"If you go 8-8 and keep him that's a huge mistake

I think anything less than playoffs and it's time to move on from Philbin"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No I agree, but the Jets got some big improvements on defence and arguably had a better front 7 last year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. Brady gets a 50k fine and no games missed. /r/NFL loses their shit

2. [](/NE)Pats go 12-4 taking the division

3. [](/NYJ)Jets go 11-5 taking the #5 seed

4. The [](/BUF)Bills go 6-10 and fire Rex after just one season. Their offence ranks in the bottom 4 of the league

5. [](/MIA)Fish go 8-8 but 1-5 in the division only beating the Patriots in Miami and fire Philbin"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Brady

Gronk

Edelman

LaFell

Amendola

Hightower

Collins

All athletic af. I'd have picked Big Vince to place our entire O-line &amp; D-line in the street scenario but he's gone :("
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya at this point I've just accepted they'll fine Tom because they've made this such a big deal there's no way they admit they got nothing

But I think it'd be much to go after the organization. Then again Kraft is worth billions so what does he care"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*After* the AFCCG

Seriously where are you getting your facts from www.AFCEastbutnotthePatriots.com?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wow I didn't realize the '00 season started before May

This would be the offseason before his first season wouldn't it? The '99 season would've just finished and the Rams would be defending Champions"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You think they don't do that?

There's a reason Ray Rice successfully sued (or whatever it was) the NFL after the second suspension"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Thanks bot, I'm stupid"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh sorry you're correct
-Butt-Fumble-,"No you're not. Realistically if we shopped him we could get a 1st from a desperate team like the Jets who would instantly become SB favourites

But most teams would offer a 2nd or 3rd if they even wanted him. He has 2 years on his contract and he's 38"
-Butt-Fumble-,Probably whichever is his 'official' title or whatever one costs more the NFLPA would fight for I assume
-Butt-Fumble-,"Is Williams a NT or just a DT?

Becuase Vince is the best NT since '04 for sure"
-Butt-Fumble-,'More probable than not'
-Butt-Fumble-,"DMac knows my name

I'm also not circumcised

It's snowing on Mt.Fuji"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh I do remember those threads!

I never really contributed well in that sense to the subreddit as ST"
-Butt-Fumble-,"We lived such similar relationships for a while

I dated a Sri Lankan Hollister model. While her family was wealthy, I'm actually a trust fund kid. My parents went from extreme poverty to being pretty well off to the point my parents just bought their 4th house

Super high maintenance, pretty stupid though tbh"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I mean.. The Ravens *did* win the Super Bowl

The AFC was top heavy but the teams at the top were pretty good"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Worked for OJ

But seriously wtf is this guy going on about? Why does Giselle protect Brady?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"How many boxing fights have you watched? How much do you know about the 10pt system used for scoring **round by round**

This isn't Pride FC

It's scored by how you view dominance in the ring. While Floyd's defence was amazing, some people view control and aggression to mean more for winning a round

There's major media outlets that had it tied/for Manny but you're right. There's *no* way Manny could've won that 'fight'"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Watch their games again, a lot of the time those teams were playing from behind so of course they got to score a lot, they got a lot of attempts"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Miss 1 game, loses

Brady goes 15-0 while he never stops screaming on the field. Wins SB50, flips off the camera and retires while fucking Goodell on the podium"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'd be okay with it
-Butt-Fumble-,He's similar stat wise to guys like Marshall
-Butt-Fumble-,Thank god
-Butt-Fumble-,Him and I have the same name so I love him to death
-Butt-Fumble-,Why the move away from your wife? If you don't mind my asking
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's not what this controversy is about

No one disputes that deflating the balls 1 pSi is much of an advantage

Brady just normally plays better 2nd half anyways"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Drafted a replacement for Vince, drafted a replacement for Connolly (Who sucked anyways)

We really only lost our star secondary and went down to an average/just bellow average secondary but beefed up our line"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh sorry I'll fix that
-Butt-Fumble-,"I agree with your last bit but I'd argue our schedule is easier this next season than our last one, even with a jacked up division"

Even when you're feeling at your worst, you're still worth the world. Stay strong. "
-Butt-Fumble-,"Good luck on the exam! As a non-American, what's VE Day?"
-Butt-Fumble-,'SpyflateHernandez'
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh :l
-Butt-Fumble-,"Without a doubt yes

Better to debate first ballot but he's going in the Hall"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I sure wouldn't condone any downvoting if you said *why* you wouldn't take the prime version of the two guys who are still competing for #1 at almost the age of 40 over just the current #1. Brady has been an MVP candidate for most of the recent years, Manning *won* the MVP last year and this is during the era of prime Rodgers

People can't seriously think '84 Marino '07 Brady or '04 Manning dropped into next season wouldn't out preform Rodgers would they?

You absolutely are getting downvoted for making a bold claim without any support behind it"
-Butt-Fumble-,I don't like gold bets
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; their early stats weren't high volume

Actually Brady was, he lead the league in TDs his second year. That's why he was still seen as the next big thing

Wilson right now gets the same criticism but less praise which is expected *because* he doesn't have the flashy numbers"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It wasn't a bad flag at all

The penalty was stupid though, literally no reason for the hold but he did it anyways. Should've been a touchdown but one of your players muffed up and held Chung"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's notorious for picking the hot players over established ones

But it is Tom Brady so I'm sure it'd be tougher. But I expect Hightower to have taken Mayo's play calling next season"
-Butt-Fumble-,Seriously I get why the Megatron TD is questionable but Dez made a fucking catch god dammit
-Butt-Fumble-,The fact they think it's even close the talent between the Vikings and Titans is laughable
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's totally fair

But remember passer rating has a lot that goes into it and someone like Montana played amazing in the playoffs in a much harder time for QBs"
-Butt-Fumble-,"If he goes 4-0 with our team? He'd pretty much have to look good

But lets say he starts out 0-2 but looks good, then improves and throws 3TDs followed by 4TDs weeks 3 &amp; 5?

You're telling me they don't think about it?"
-Butt-Fumble-,But won't be be ~3 mil in dead money now?
-Butt-Fumble-,Third worst line in the league but isn't it the worst for run blocking?
-Butt-Fumble-,"25% trying to say we're innocent in the dumbest ways possible

50% flaming how we're literally the worst thing ever. ""Should the Pats SBs be given to the other teams?"""
-Butt-Fumble-,"GOAT [](/SF)Rice

BOAT [](/MIN)Moss

[e] What I mean by this is clearly if you look at careers Rice is the *greatest* ever. But if we only got em for a single game? I'd take Moss. I think he has the most talent and he's the *best* wide receiver ever"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You realize we take up ~19%

That's close to the # of Colts + Broncos fans for this sub

And the amount of people who *hate* Brady is way higher than the ones who don't like Peyton"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Charges were dropped, he wasn't found not guilty in a court of law because he never went to court

Either way Lewis clearly turned himself around and became a much better person"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Did Stork play this game? I thought we were sitting 3/5ths of our line

Also going 10/17 against Buffalo's defence *without* that many starters is pretty great

Especially since both Peyton &amp; Rodgers did much worse just two &amp; three weeks before this game against the same defence"
-Butt-Fumble-,No that's just how I feel
-Butt-Fumble-,"I know, it was hilarious to watch from an outside perspective"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Historically* easy schedule

Seriously isn't it the record? Our opponents had a .250 win% outside of their divisions or something crazy"
-Butt-Fumble-,"In fairness Gronk might still be an 8th grader, did anyone actually *see* him graduate?

This could be for his classmates"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Rich Gannon had been in the league for over a decade

He had just thrown 3800+ yards which at the time was pretty damn great"
-Butt-Fumble-,..h-he's the exception on this team
-Butt-Fumble-,"Most: [](/CAR)Panthers or if AFC teams are allowed despite reality the [](/OAK)Raiders

Least: [](/NYG)Giants. I can't take another 'DAE prophecy' happening again"
-Butt-Fumble-,"And I 100% agree. But there's still no evidence he asked them to tamper with it after inspection or do anything against the rules. Just that he lied about knowing them

But if he wanted to make it legal I'm not sure why they wouldn't just do it before inspection anyways..."
-Butt-Fumble-,"We already know

This stupid witch hunt has made us connect with Saints &amp; Steelers fans a lot more

They've been the best to us because they know what it's like"
-Butt-Fumble-,Go Saints next year man!
-Butt-Fumble-,I used to have my own to be fair. They aren't that uncommon/expensive
-Butt-Fumble-,Well I'm sorry that happens but that's the purpose of the megathread
-Butt-Fumble-,What?
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm pretty sure they have yes. And you're spot on with that

People would ask how much harder it was to throw and I'd tell them see how far you can chuck a rugby ball"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Now see I've been to America many times

I know *why* Americans feel these ways on things. But you have to understand. It's like fighting pot. One side is clearly a losing battle. Health Care is the future and the guns laws is considered a super old way of thinking by the rest of the world

It's kind of like arguing for the imperial system. It *can* be used. But there's absolutely better ways, the rest of the world has already done them though and America is kind of stubborn on admitting another country does stuff better. Lol like the 'freedom' of Americans. Freedom of Speech isn't even good. Freedom of Expression is the way to go

I've seen some very smart people be very racist there too but that's just because America is 50 different countries, not 50 different states. They don't hear or teach much about other cultures and countries. Watching the news you guys watch is hilariously biased"
-Butt-Fumble-,Someone posted it with sources a couple days ago I saw
-Butt-Fumble-,"Because this subreddit doesn't like to acknowledge their extreme bias

If you're a Jets fan who says y'all will be good then you're just a 'homer' and your opinion is disregarded

But because the Rams, Browns &amp; Bills have been *awful* and I mean *awful* for so long but get the odd upset then all of a sudden they don't suck. No no they're no where near as bad as the Jets or Raiders, they're just 'underrated'

The truth is the Fish and Bills have arguably the worst O-lines in the league. You have a much better run defence than either, better pass rush than the fish, better secondary than either, much better O-line, better receivers *and* better QB options than the Bills. But the Bills are totally gonna go 11-5 next year and the Jets are gonna go 4-12

I hate the Jets but I give credit where it's due"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well actually he looked great, slowed a bit, *then* got injured, then continued to play bad

His drop offs started week 8 against us and his injury wasn't until week 15"
-Butt-Fumble-,So you're saying they're overdue for a win in Lambeau?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sorry about your downvotes mate. You're not really wrong

I think the issue is more it doesn't matter if Wells thinks it's 'more probable than not' it's making a jury feel that while there's an opposition attacking every point they have"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I want you to know I'm downvoting you

It's not because I'm a Pats fan, it's not because you're anti-Patriots

It's because you're generalizing an entire fanbase, encouraging the biggest issue of the sub in flairbase downvoting &amp; being a jerk"
-Butt-Fumble-,I have no idea what to do with this information but I'm glad you made it
-Butt-Fumble-,"look those are the same people posting that awful cheating website, they don't represent our fanbase well at all"
-Butt-Fumble-,It would never be worth it. You'd give up so much you'd only have a QB and no talent to surround them by
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's fair but then Luck &amp; Rodgers wouldn't be ranked so hot either

God damn that was a bad weekend for QBs. Except Brady I think he had a 3 digit passer rating"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm still upset about the Hardy one the most

He's missing 26 games for doing *nothing* but calling the police because his girlfriend tried to beat him

The guns turned out to be legal"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's not saying he agrees with a suspension. He's been pretty clear he thinks suspending Brady is stupid and the result of a witch hunt

His job is to report things is all"
-Butt-Fumble-,Are you done with haikus?
-Butt-Fumble-,"If you post a thread right now saying name your top 5 runningbacks and you take all the Chiefs/Seahawks fans answers out

I bet you'd get 90% Charles over Lynch"
-Butt-Fumble-,God damn do I ever miss Big Vince
-Butt-Fumble-,"huh

I didn't know Fleming was black... That's not something you normally miss"
-Butt-Fumble-,Gilmore over Mario?
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm so happy I got rid of that account when I did

People didn't like the Pats then, and I tended to be a pretty big, but controversial user. I started getting weird death threats and just mean PM's

I can't imagine that would've gotten any better seeing how this subreddits reacted to recent news..."
-Butt-Fumble-,"Only against us really

You guys still managed to beat the Seahawks with Lynch"
-Butt-Fumble-,Does Garoppolo gets us to repeat? Cause then I'm okay with Tommy walking off into the sunset a champion
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's fair. I'm just saying I wouldn't sit too comfortably if I were Tom

Lets say it's a 1 game suspension. Jimmy gets to throw against the Steelers defence and Bradys first game back is against Buffalo? There could be an outcry for the new gun"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I hate it just as much when Patriot fans bring up as much as when anyone else does. Maybe even more

I'm just so tired of seeing this dumb thing in every thread"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh no, we're off on different pages then

Unless they get new evidence, they have almost no chance to win it in court"
-Butt-Fumble-,I mean look at the punishments for Spygate compared to Spygate II on the '10 Broncos
-Butt-Fumble-,I'd take that bet easily if I'm /u/SpygateHernandez 
-Butt-Fumble-,Mods banned my old one 'cause I argued for a Floyd vs Manny thread
-Butt-Fumble-,"Didn't he play a whole game?

I thought he played great then got injured the next game"
-Butt-Fumble-,"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT :(

So what game did you lose to Belichick but we didn't have Brady for? Cause Bills is 3-2 against the Giants in this era"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yes and Wilson's situation should be how it should be for the Titans

But before Mariota's even shown up he's already been declared the first day starter"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The investigator should've found something real then

The job of the person under investigation isn't to try and make the investigators job easier

He doesn't have to, nor should he, do anything he isn't forced to by either law or in his contract. Handing over personal phone records is neither of those

[e] And to be clear, vague texts from months before and accusations/assumptions are not real evidence. They might 'be good enough' for a 'more probable than not' and that might be enough for the NFL. But that doesn't make *any* of this fair"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I hate clubs, can't stand em

But they are good places for meeting people. Certainly a lot better than online"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He doesn't need to

It's their job to prove his guilt, not his job to prove his innocence"
-Butt-Fumble-,I like to imagine Brady retires and helps mentor Luck with that
-Butt-Fumble-,"I guess it depends. Given recent events you should see the responses we get if we make comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/355xsa/report_tom_brady_suspension_could_span_up_to_one/cr1b23o) or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/355xsa/report_tom_brady_suspension_could_span_up_to_one/cr1dw8e)

And in a thread about predicting a record, I wouldn't say giving a team a very possible record a 'dick move'. I'd call it making a prediction you don't like"
-Butt-Fumble-,"We... we don't play Green Bay *or* New Orleans though though?

[e] Oh I see you confused us with the preseason. We play the Steelers and Bills weeks 1 and 2"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Have you ever heard the theory it was his son and he was covering for him? It's pretty good

His son wrote in a journal how much he wanted to stab her like 2 days before it all happened"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Keep in mind Schefty might just be saying this because he *wants* it to happen

He's been pretty vocal he doesn't think there should've been any punishment. So when he found out it was 4 games and a 1st rounder *and then some*. He probably thinks it's much worse than it needed to be"
-Butt-Fumble-,"And I can accept people saying that

But I get super butthurt hearing 'he bribed them with autographs to deflate balls' when all we know is Brady gave autographs to ball boys. I'm sure the star of a franchise signs a lot of stuff for a lot of guys. There's no reason stated why he did it

And then the ball boys *clearly* messed with balls without Brady's knowledge before. ""But *this* time Brady was involved"" - everyone without any knowledge of the report.

Brady lied about not knowing guys. But there is absolutely NO evidence that he wanted them to do anything illegal for the games and now people are going to spread that everywhere just like the Spygate bs all over again"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Rodgers @ the Lions was bad too if the Seahawks game was

10% lower completion percentage and 27 less yards thrown"
-Butt-Fumble-,...this makes it seem *way* less impressive tbh
-Butt-Fumble-,"Or ya know, because Belichick benches even stars if they fumble

We've been way harsher on it than other teams"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm super over the super hero movies. They've gotten so bad and they'll keep pumping out 30 a year as long as /r/AdviceAnimals keeps spending their money

Spending time with the new girl sounds fun though! What's she like?"
-Butt-Fumble-,Didn't this get changed a couple years ago? I thought we use the same size balls now
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well *the Patriots* have lost it plenty of times

*Brady* has only missed it once and it was a 3 way tie for the winner"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'd pick Brown too but both him and Edelman were human pocketknifes
-Butt-Fumble-,"Nah fuck that, I want deflated balls, ticket scandals &amp; favourite jersey colours"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Even with tension I'd pick em

~~Didn't Tate sleep with Wilson's wife like the week before they won the Super Bowl?~~ Carroll runs a professional ship I think"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah the Ravens/Bills fans are saying this too

It's not people are upvoting Brady, people are upvoting they don't think Rodgers is better than the already established GOATS

You don't just get a spot among the greatest for having a great 4 year stretch as a QB, there's very little reason to think Marino, Joe, Peyton or Brady in their primes in this league wouldn't out preform him"
-Butt-Fumble-,Can't one argue that making the plays that matter when they count *leads* to accolades?
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think it's because most people really wanna see Rodgers get another ring

It sucks but it's probably *less* likely he gets another. It just doesn't happen that often. That said they're a great team and will always be a contender if ARod is still playing at this level

But this guy has literally only 2 out of the 12 playoff teams changing and the CCG's are *so* close to being the same. In all likeliness that won't happen again"
-Butt-Fumble-,I think it's because of *how* he worded his opinion
-Butt-Fumble-,"Flacco is the QB I'm most scared of to play in playoffs and for good reason. He's an animal there

He'd rival Brady in my choices for sure"
-Butt-Fumble-,Ya one there's actual evidence and the other there's just speculation over extremely vague texts
-Butt-Fumble-,Two years ago? Broncos and I don't think it was too close
-Butt-Fumble-,He looks less awkward with the neard imo
-Butt-Fumble-,"You can call it whatever you want but it doesn't change anything, y'all still would've been underdogs the next two games

And under rule it's a tuck, it wasn't the first time that rule was called and it certainly wasn't the last. It was a dumb rule and I'm glad it's gone, but it was a rule none the less"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wasn't it like 4 less INTs? I know that probably makes it much lower % wise but still

Their YPA are almost identical though"
-Butt-Fumble-,"They're probably giving him the #4/5 QB spot on the list though

MVP doesn't really consider anyone outside of QB so he'd be in the discussion for sure but that's not how the top 100 is *supposed* to work"
-Butt-Fumble-,No 2 decades after our last success. Our counter just restarted friend
-Butt-Fumble-,Weak smack talk bro
-Butt-Fumble-,"C'mon man *that's* the best you got to come back with?

He posted something stupid, you don't need to get stupid with him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Alright but that's besides the point

He's not being fined for going against the rules though? Like at all

He's being fined for lying and not cooperating. *Exactly* what Favre was fined for. Not the action. But the lying

That's anywhere from a 25-100k fine imo

Regardless of what you *think* he may have been involved with. That's not what he'll be punished for"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah that's what's so fucked up here

None of this had to do with a home game or the games under investigation

But the fucking report is so clearly biased people are just ripping on it anyways and calling it 'evidence'"
-Butt-Fumble-,I laughed
-Butt-Fumble-,"I like Skip Bayless, he's the Chael Sonnen of the NFL and people need to just stop taking him so seriously, he's fun for the odd rant and Favre &gt; Rodgers"
-Butt-Fumble-,"To make people mad wanna see my list?

1. [](/ATL)Julio
2. [](/DAL)Dez
3. [](/DET)Megatron
4. [](/GB)Jordy
5. [](/PIT)Brown
6. [](/NYG)OBJ
7. [](/DEN)DT
8. [](/CIN)Green
9. [](/IND)Hilton
10. [](/DET)Tate (although it's damn hard to pick a number 10 so I'm not stuck on this)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"There's 'some' stupid/terrible fans in every fanbase

I like to imagine the 'a lot' falls into rational, kind people who just like football"
-Butt-Fumble-,[](/CAR)Panthers over [](/IND)Colts
-Butt-Fumble-,:( can confirm: am sad
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Please don't be a pats fan, please don't be a pats fan*

Check his history. Fuck."
-Butt-Fumble-,"...no?

That's not even a possibility man. The report says the Patriots organization had nothing to do with it but it's possible Brady did

No one's talking about Belichick being even fined here"
-Butt-Fumble-,"ITT Jags

In the predict the records everyone was giving the Jags an 8-8 record though.."
-Butt-Fumble-,"No you can delete stuff off your phone and then they can't see it

You can't delete stuff off a printout, if they request it for a time slot and you give it, you're giving everything for that time

Lack of cooperation has been punished on an elite QB before, and that was just a 50k fine

I don't see how you think one's worse than the other"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Fuck the suspension, why'd the organization get punished?!"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The records are more than what's on your phone

Everyone knows he wasn't asked to physically hand over his phone, the records are of every text he would've sent out in that time, and because he has an iPhone it'd actually have all his deleted messages too

Handing over his physical phone would have *less* information

The NFLPA told him not to hand over his records , he listened to them and now everyone thinks that means he's guilty? C'mon even if you hate the Pats you gotta admit how weak this arguments getting"
-Butt-Fumble-,[Here's your prize](http://i.imgur.com/O8uLmQ8.jpg)
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; if they dont have enough evidence to say otherwise, hes guilty

Are you literally saying it's guilty unless proven innocent? Because then I'd like to claim Marino is guilty of 17 unsolved murders in Miami. If you can't disprove it he's now guilty and should be banned from working with the league anymore

And in your job scenario, that's actually illegal. Without proof you can sue for wrongful termination. The NFL isn't your normal workplace though so comparing them in any regard is useless"
-Butt-Fumble-,"...So we get a win and Garoppolo becomes the new Brady?

Lets do this shit!"
-Butt-Fumble-,If the Colts or Bills get to call us rivals then dammit we can call those stupid Giants rivals too :(
-Butt-Fumble-,Ew? More like &lt;3
-Butt-Fumble-,"Seriously days 2 &amp; 3 of the megathread were just seeing who could get the most karma

The only ones with real input were days 1 &amp; 4 and with no big stories set to break I'm not sure this megathread is necessary"
-Butt-Fumble-,I mean how bad could it really be?
-Butt-Fumble-,Honestly the Seahawk SB. Even more than the Rams or Eagles one
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I laughed, I like it"
-Butt-Fumble-,"C'mon man

You know I like you, but this is just trying to make people upset. Literally no good could come from bringing that up in this thread"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah it's not like they're going to go in read the Wells report and then say if it's good enough

The report will be challenged and without any better evidence it's going to be ripped apart"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah it's not the best but for the Patriots is sure is

He was old but even at the time people thought it was crazy"
-Butt-Fumble-,"And there's probably a pretty low chance the Colts would take it

There's not really any reason the Packers would trade Rodgers, so I don't know why people think they would do this

But realistically the Colts have more going for them with Luck than Rodgers, the Packers would need to go above *and* beyond to trade for Luck"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I love Peyton, he's my second favourite QB in the league easily

After last year reddit was 55/45 for Peyton. But Brady winning *another* ring changes it a lot bigger than a big stat year and a blowout playoff loss"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I-I've just watched a lot of TV and played with my puppies...

Have fun :D"
-Butt-Fumble-,...I'd be okay with that
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wilfork will sometimes take double teams but if it's one *good* top tier O-linemen he's only gonna get singled, he is an older guy keep in mind

Wilfork will still make it easier for JJ and Clowney next year trust me"
-Butt-Fumble-,Rodgers fucks with the pressure though?
-Butt-Fumble-,"The worst part is if we say anything to try and defend we normally get bombarded with downvotes and comments calling us 'blind homers'

But the Bills, Fish, Ravens, Giants, Broncos &amp; Eagles fans are all *totally* unbiased though don't worry"
-Butt-Fumble-,Really? I heard it was for millions
-Butt-Fumble-,"What does that possibly have to do with spelling? And it's an international sport

Thus the *Canadian* Football League existing as well"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No but just that we've done better than 12-4 with a historically terrible secondary and no line

Now we have a bad secondary and a good line

If the suspension comes down to 2 games we could absolutely go 12-4 or even if it stays, going 2-2 isn't impossible

We'll still be favoured over the Colts and who knows what'll happen with the Bills"
-Butt-Fumble-,Seriously your defence was on par with ours statistically
-Butt-Fumble-,"I feel you DMac

Don't worry, you finish your bet

It's snowing on Mt.Fuji"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You haven't turned on a TV, radio or anything I guess?

The entire sports world is talking about the NFL, *in the middle of the offseason*

And you better bet weeks 1 and the game against the Colts just got all their eyes on them to watch Garoppolo's start and Brady's comeback

But yeah *we're* pathetic because we don't by the 'evidence' that you seem to know *makes* him 100% guilty"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I can't see Brady trashing the union, that wouldn't go well for him I think

I'm pretty sure the games are going to be dropped to at least 2 games anyways"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Is this gonna be a joke again?

I'm glad though, Reed is one of the best players we've ever gotten to see"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Counter arguments

[1](http://i.imgur.com/PwfEMGS.gif)

[2 &amp; 3](http://i.imgur.com/wEph1lM.webm)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Good luck, I tried that for about a week and then deleted ST"
-Butt-Fumble-,We all do
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. Nothing makes me more angry than:

&gt;""Who cares about Welker? We have Edelman and they're the exact same""

Fuck those people. Welker was amazing for us. I love Jules and he's one of my favourites but just because they're speedy, short, white guys doesn't make them equal"
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's kind of what the 'haters' of the time were saying

But it was a really dumb argument then tbh. He was making incredible drives and really tough throws on a team meant for defence. There was a reason we set the record for consecutive wins. Our defence was top 10 and our offence was clutch as hell"
-Butt-Fumble-,"If they haven't seen the show why would they care?

[e] Alright then. I've never seen Firefly or The Wire. No one can talk about it anymore because I haven't seen it"
-Butt-Fumble-,Packers and Pats have actually been super close for defence rankings the last 5 years. Almost every year it's been almost tied. Except iirc 2 years y'all have had better defences than us by a decent amount
-Butt-Fumble-,Sounds like a bro
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I pray for the sorry souls that have to play my TiCats

^^^*Oskee* ^^^*Wee* ^^^*Wee* ^^^*motherfuckers!*"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What's Dalton's record against Brady? 1-1 isn't it?

Eli is 2-2 (maybe 3-2) and Flacco has a losing record against us I think?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"lol my two big bold predictions are Raiders win the West and Panthers win the Super Bowl

That being said even I'd be a little shocked to see the Raiders in the playoffs"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wish you could say the same for all players

But then we get guys like Spikes and Shady who just like to burn bridges"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No? I'm Canadian mate

The old CFL balls were like 1.5x bigger than NFL balls. Easy as hell to catch but hard to throw fast"
-Butt-Fumble-,He sounds like he has a mouth full of peanut butter
-Butt-Fumble-,"The eye test and you picked Peyton @ #1?

I could understand that reasoning for Flacco/Eli/Romo for who'd you want

But then why is Matt Ryan so high, Flacco/Eli so low and Peyton @ #1?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I love Collins, there's talks of him moving to SS but I like having incredible LBers"
-Butt-Fumble-,Also if it's for the '14-'15 season like OP says both Big Vince and Revis might get in
-Butt-Fumble-,"If I say *anything* negative about him I get downvoted a lot

He's completely switched places with Cutler after last season"
-Butt-Fumble-,This one isn't very friendly for us though :(
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. I thought it was kinda an obvious move but the Titans FO thought otherwise

If Mariota doesn't pan out this will be seen as one of the dumber moves by a FO in recent NFL history for sure"
-Butt-Fumble-,Shhhh. Staying within your rights is now a clear admission of guilt and prove without a doubt that Brady is guilty of illegal activity and should be used against you
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think it's between us and them

It comes down to if you count an edge rusher as a LB though"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I go down to the capital about once every 2 months. Normally cross the border to go to the french strip clubs/casinos though

But I didn't mean horse races, I mean like nascar shit or something"
-Butt-Fumble-,So does this mean Brady's gonna get raped?! Big Ben nooooooo
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; but in fairness they were probably cheating somehow

My jimmies m8

But nah I know what you mean, I just hate people spewing such bs and everyone believes it. Not many people seem to realize the Colts had the #1 defence in '07 *not* the Pats"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You get the fuck outta here with that

^^He'd ^^be ^^great ^^for ^^you ^^guys"
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's how most preseasons are though, people were doing it about Bortles too if you remember

A lot of the time they're playing shotty secondaries so the receivers get open a lot more. Closer to college level play, like Oregon"
-Butt-Fumble-,"And that's fair. I agree with his points of why it's bad to spread false information but he can't be taken seriously if he goes after personal attacks on you and your character. It's also against the sub rules and *should* be downvoted

But that's not why he was downvoted. He was being downvoted before his second comment. He was around -3 or so and you were at +9 iirc

That's the issue. The first time 70% of redditors hear something, that's what they're going to believe and then if you go against it you get labelled

It's why I had to delete my old account once it got too well known here"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I guess it comes down to who kills momentum more

You'd need around 2 sacks to kill a drive completely so 1/8 chance but that many sacks would destroy confidence in an offence quickly

Whereas the CB would stop a drive in 1/10th of all plays. Assuming the drive takes 10 snaps per drive you'd be almost guaranteed to pick em off every time

All in all I want the turnovers more, I'd take the interceptions"
-Butt-Fumble-,"People give mad props to Charles and Houston

But yeah Kelce is a ridiculous TE and super underrated

Sean Smith isn't ahead of Revis, Sherman, Grimes, Haden, Davis or Harris Jr. though"
-Butt-Fumble-,"But in modern day most people put them behind ARod

I don't think there's much of a debate Peyton from '03-'09 and Brady from '03-'10 aren't at a higher level than Rodgers now and significantly higher than themselves now"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's fine

People give him shit but honestly his first assessment of the Ray Rice situation was fine in my opinion. His reaction to public outcry was more than just his doing, it sucks but really he was backed into a corner by the media and forced to re-punish him

The Pats scandal sucks but he didn't even give out the punishment

Hardy &amp; Bountygate were handled terribly. Like *really* badly but oh well, you win some you lose some

Really no matter what he does he'll be scrutinized by someone. It's a thankless job"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It was still seen as a let down

Most people were ranking him mid to low 20s in the league behind Dalton for sure. But people also liked Dalton more tbf

Fish fans seemed to be 50/50 on here of whether they liked him or not for the future"
-Butt-Fumble-,You stay away from him!
-Butt-Fumble-,"Because he didn't answer questions in a public event *not about* the situation?

I'm sure he just want's to be *very* careful with his words from hear on out"
-Butt-Fumble-,Decisions are far from just 'landing more punches'
-Butt-Fumble-,"I hate this thinking, innovation isn't a bad thing at all"
-Butt-Fumble-,Do the 49ers get 3 of their rings with a * now too? What about the Broncos?
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm guessing it was manningface by the clickbait title and vague responses from others
-Butt-Fumble-,"The Patriots have made 4 straight AFCCGs

Brady might be a *huge* reason for our success but I can't imagine he's the *only* reason we've done well.. well okay maybe in '13 we were all Brady but not the other years"
-Butt-Fumble-,Did you see Revis that game? He gave up like 60 yards to Sanders on the first drive
-Butt-Fumble-,"Am I being wooshed? 'Cause I don't get it

Peyton is *far* from a one trick pony"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I know PFF grades aren't the end all be all

Butt while Houston got the 2nd highest score for a ~~defensive~~ player, Watt got over double his and destroyed their rating system

Watt was significantly better than *anyone* this year. By a lot"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You can tweak so many things in games to change huge outcomes, but that's why it just goes by what happened. Similar to tipped INTs, are they really a QBs fault? But they're going to be counted

Sure the Malcolm INT is a huge reason we won

But so was Brady going like 13/14 and 2 TDs in the 4th quarter and shredding the best defence in the league on the biggest and best stage in the game

The reason the Malcolm pick even mattered was because of what Brady had just done *on the field*"
-Butt-Fumble-,Put him on the Jets and I'll shit my pants
-Butt-Fumble-,"[](/MIN)Vikings &amp; [](/CAR)Panthers

I first started watching football in '98 so Moss was my favourite player for a long time, Favre was up there too so I really like 'em for '09. Panthers because I like Cam Newton and their logo a lot"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It's a weird question for sure

But I don't think anyone wants to argue Manning played well that game"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh. my. god. That'd be hilarious to watch him get wrecked

But you wanna know something worse? I *love* mma and only kinda like boxing. But I know how much better the athletes are in boxing. People genuinely believe Floyd would suck if they threw him in a cage. They don't understand how hard and fast he hits. They'd shoot for the double leg and get an uppercut that'd floor them

But the subreddit is adamant any top 15 dude at his weightclass would floor him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm feeling Derek Carr, CJ Mosley &amp; Mack are all going to an even higher level next year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I prefer Smoke's MK9 look

He was stupidly OP though"
-Butt-Fumble-,It's quite literally [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyW48QlB2s)
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; And back then when we bitched about it all we got in response was stfu lololol RapeistBurger

I'm sorry man. Literally this last week has made me relate to Steelers and Saints fans. It's hard to look at those things from the outside in but god damn is all this every just shit"
-Butt-Fumble-,"EVEN FLLLLOOOOOOW! FLOATS AROUND LIKE BUUUUTTEEEERRFLLLIIIESSS!

Sounds good man, I used to teach music! What instruments do you play? Other than the bong I guess"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Whoa*

1 good year in 3 seasons and now he's not much worse than the best QB in the league?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"That isn't even homer, literally *no one* around here was predicting a loss of picks

Now 'probably' with no hard evidence for a single player is enough to fuck over the organization for a year"
-Butt-Fumble-,The thing that says he asked for them to be in the legal limits earlier?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well we did lose a 1st and a 4th..

How much you gonna pay up?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"But they're 6th rounders, 7th rounders, udfa and Mallett who's barely played yet

One of them is a GOAT, and the other 3 started this year. Marvin Lewis was using top prospects"
-Butt-Fumble-,"There's arguments for Unitas or Marino

But honestly all of those guys have a good claim for #1 too"
-Butt-Fumble-,"'07 we had one of the hardest schedules ever though and went 18-1

I know it's become a joke season for everyone else but I'm still super proud of it. Best team in the history of the league"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Why does at the end it say EJ Manuel went 22/31, 327 yards and 3 TDs for the Ravens?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Let's say Brady got suspended stupidly for 1-4 games. If Garoppolo looked amazing and someone offered a 1st I bet Belichick would be damn tempted for it

Brady isn't even close to worth 3 firsts though. Someone offered that and we'd trade him *now*"
-Butt-Fumble-,Or those extremely promising years with the Browns. Seriously have people not watched the '95 Browns documentary?
-Butt-Fumble-,"The issue is the style doesn't appeal to casual fans. But mma is the same way. So many of my friends get bored when it isn't two dudes going toe to toe constantly

You gotta love the sport and understand defence and ground games respectively or else it's going to be a really boring event"
-Butt-Fumble-,Didn't he beat the Seahawks and Broncos in '13? He also beat the Bengals/Broncos in the playoffs this year
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh that's fair, it's a pretty damn shitty excuse for an explanation then"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I prefer this one

[http://jerseygirlsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terrell-owens-tears.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6wJP2Eu.jpg)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What?! One FC but not WSOF?

I love Askren more than most but Shields vs Paul Harris has me fully torqued"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Runs super fast up the sideline for a deep ball? Look at his yards/any

It might be one trick but it's a pretty cool trick to have on your team"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Right, they asked for his personal texts. They want ones related to the incident but to determine if they are they go through his records

You don't think they just ask hey can you print off stuff that'd make you look guilty? And then they he can just go through and say 'oh sorry I didn't find it but here's random texts I'll let you see' and they'll be cool with that?

No they wanted his texts records. They'll go through it all trying to find stuff related to the incident

And like you said. They *asked*. Because he's *allowed to say no*"
-Butt-Fumble-,He did better than that didn't he? Revis gave up like 100+ yards to Sanders in the first two quarters and Sanders only had 151 yards that whole game
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; If he was ever healthy

:( don't remind me

Although same could be said about Gronk"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Nah dude we're all homers who are just thinking too much of what we want

~~The Ravens, Bills, Fish, Broncos, Raiders &amp; Eagles fans are *totally* unbiased though and are looking at this with fresh eyes~~

Surprisingly though Jets fans have been pretty cool about all this for the most part

[e] I'm a dick, I shouldn't call out fanbases like that"
-Butt-Fumble-,"There's *no* evidence that the Patriots organization had literally any knowledge/did anything illegal

Just individual parties though

That's why *no one* was expecting lost picks"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The same argument can be used for Peyton and Brady eh?

Look at how they've 'lucked' into playoff wins before. Brady got *damn* lucky in the '03 AFCCG as did Peyton in '06. Being lucky is a part of the sport"

-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; in exchange for the deflation of the footballs

It doesn't say that. It says he gave autographs to ball boys, it's highly possible they're just fans of the team"
-Butt-Fumble-,"2 games is a witch hunt imo

A fine should be because he lied. You shouldn't be able to punish someone for something you think he might have done without any evidence"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sorry if I'm wrong on that then, but if Brady texted him, it'd still be on the printout of the ball boys phone. That's how a printout works

Can I provide evidence for it? No but I can speculate it's 'more probable than not' and that's good enough now. Judging by him asking for a printout for the ball boy and the ball boys printout stretched from *at least* October to January so why would Brady's be any smaller of a sample?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He totally does *because* of that

There was no outcry, he didn't punish Rice hard

Then the video came out, casuals flipped their shit, and he suspended the crap out of him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You can absolutely argue Brees bellow Romo, Big Ben, Rivers or Luck if we're going off 'right now'"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Have you seen half of the crap that gets deleted here?

This might even qualify for top half

That's how bad it gets!"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah I bet for Luck the Packers would give up Rodgers, 2 first rounders &amp; 2 seconds

Rodgers for ~4-5 years or Luck for 11+"
-Butt-Fumble-,"**Spoiler:** I'm not actually Bruce Wayne

But my charm might make you feel otherwise"
-Butt-Fumble-,Yeah really if Garoppolo just plays *well* and anyone not named the Jets calls in with a decent deal for Brady I bet he thinks about it
-Butt-Fumble-,"lol I didn't even realize

But Spikes saying '4 years a slave' and Shady calling Chip racist is pretty stupid"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Most* people here have been saying shit like this

You have any idea how many people in /r/NFL have said Belichick should be suspended too?

It's like 90% of people have literally no idea what happened but are just spewing bs because 'DAE cheatriots?'"
-Butt-Fumble-,The Bills were also a worse team last year than the Eagles
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; the team around him is completely unable to match his talent

I'd disagree there Julio Jones is *way* better a WR than Ryan is a QB"
-Butt-Fumble-,Is there still any evidence that Brady was involved? Besides vague text messages that people are *speculating* about?
-Butt-Fumble-,Nah she's all about that Woody
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah like... whoa that just hit me

Could you imagine if by 2019 Gronk didn't have a ring? I'd be panicking so much, but now? We're good for him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"This subreddit lately hasn't been kind to Pats fans, anyone who doesn't talk shit about their own team and we're in a thread about a *very* biased article about Luck

I'm not surprised a Pats fan and a fan of the QB being slandered itt are being downvoted for disagreeing with the article"
-Butt-Fumble-,And a better pass rush helps out the secondary too. I think the Eagles will soar high
-Butt-Fumble-,"Alright I think I get it, thanks a lot!"
-Butt-Fumble-,Aww but I like the Steelers :(
-Butt-Fumble-,"So why'd the Falcons get almost no punishment?

And before people say 'because they cooperated' the Pats cooperated with Spygate and *still* lost their 1st then too"
-Butt-Fumble-,What about Jerry Rice then?
-Butt-Fumble-,Really? I had the best time watching that game
-Butt-Fumble-,"Brady didn't start his rookie year. We have no idea what he'd have looked like

I think y'all should've given him another year rather than essentially throw him aside for an over hyped Geno Smith"
-Butt-Fumble-,Yes but Manning's '04 was better than Rodgers' '11
-Butt-Fumble-,Yeah the fact that Brady and Peyton are still competing for MVP and best QB against a guy like prime Rodgers should show how different of a level they're at
-Butt-Fumble-,"Woohoo!

^*I* ^*like* ^*you* ^*guys* ^*though* ^*:(*"
-Butt-Fumble-,Crazy that a TE is #2 and rivaling #1 for the best receiving grade in the NFL
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm arguing that you stated:

&gt;There was hard evidence.

Because *hard* evidence would make it so they don't need to say 'more probable than not'"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think we'd still be the #2 choice behind the Jets tbh

Belichick, a prospect at QB and Gronk is still a pretty good thing to have"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I don't think either would ever want to trade

But if the Colts for some retarded reason proposed Luck for Rodgers straight up. The Packers I think would take that trade, I doubt they ask for picks

But the Colts have all the chips. Rodgers + a first isn't close to enough. People seem to think because he's the best now he's got the most value but the different in the value is huge

Rodgers is 31 and QB's have a steep drop off year that takes place any time after ~34. He's not going to play until he's 40 just because Peyton and Tom are going freaky right now. That's not normal. People thought Favre would play longer too but eventually age kicked the crap out of him. He wasn't good for a while, only '09 was a special year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I just checked and you're right. Total you guys were ranked *just* ahead of us for defence

Also just behind the Colts. I thought the Colts had a terrible defence but they're above average"
-Butt-Fumble-,Suh before Grimes imo
-Butt-Fumble-,"The black Edelman

Or I guess Edelman is a white Brown"
-Butt-Fumble-,Idk about that guy but *Belichick* might. If he feels Garoppolo's been out preforming Brady in practice and then he looks good on the field? He'll do what's best for the team in his mind
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah I think he can be rated at the absolute highest at 5 but the lowest I'll even consider is 11

Any higher or lower is ridiculous"
-Butt-Fumble-,"[](/NYJ)Jets, [](/OAK)Raiders, [](/CAR)Panthers &amp; [](/NYG)Giants "
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah and Rice was very open and apologetic of the whole thing but public outcry still made the NFL come crashing down on him

I have no idea why people think we would've gotten it easier if we 'cooperated' more"
-Butt-Fumble-,"...they say *in the text messages* they were fucking with the pressure to get him mad

I think he knew about it. I don't think he asked for anything illegal"
-Butt-Fumble-,Who're you gonna get? Haden? Manziel or do you just keep getting historic players for each franchise?
-Butt-Fumble-,Doritos Dew It Right^tm
-Butt-Fumble-,"Isn't that true for a lot of 9ers, Steelers &amp; Cowboys fans"
-Butt-Fumble-,To be honest I was starting to worry Brady would get left out of the list. Glad he still made the cut
-Butt-Fumble-,"So with our starters we went 4-1 and then lost with our backups to the Bills?

I wouldn't be too worried tbh. I'd still pick us for the best offence in the East"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I see a lot of Fish and Bills fans saying 'good'

But at least the Jets have our back (which is weird)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"There's *so* much more to being a great corner than interceptions

Revis has insane coverage, you might have noticed how Megatron &amp; Tate did so poorly against our secondary this year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I don't care that they even punished at this point

I'm mad that there's so many big fans of the league who seem to think the report got 'hard evidence' or anything good enough to *warrant* any sort of real punishment past a fine for lying

And you're 100% right that this whole 'scandal' is about how you interpret things. Which is why it's so stupid it even exists"
-Butt-Fumble-,"They have Woodhead still so I wouldn't worry too much. Gordon can be used for runs and Danny for everything else + runs

Similar to what we did with Riddles/Vereen and Ridley/Woodhead"
-Butt-Fumble-,"At this point isn't it just a little likely he didn't rape her?

She had a boyfriend at the time, lied about being hit, lied about being drugged, she hid her black boyfriend from her family &amp; kept going after him during times she'd be able to get the most money"
-Butt-Fumble-,Sean Payton was not *rightly* suspended
-Butt-Fumble-,"Floyd blocked a lot, but he wasn't ever controlling or putting pressure on Manny

The scoring system for boxing isn't like Street Fighter. It's not like if time goes off and it's who has more life wins

The 10pt system is round by round and has a lot of factors into winning the round. It's very flawed"

Still amazing, but not prime"
-Butt-Fumble-,"But you can't use it as not cooperating

He stayed in his legal rights, because the NFLPA doesn't want this to become a regular occurrence with players, and now people are using this to say he didn't cooperate?

That's like saying I asked you for $50 dollars and you said no. Sure you didn't cooperate, but why the fuck would you?"

-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah well one guy only comes in once a week apparently, so he probably makes like 4k a year from the Patriots, I imagine Brady was just signing stuff to be a pal. Although apparently *they* don't like him so idk why anyone would sign them stuff

People can be upset that he lied to the investagators but this in no way hurts his legacy as one of the greatest and it does not mean this whole thing had been going on for a while

Actually the texts show it wasn't happening *until* the Baltimore game at best. And that's only IF Brady was bribing them, which seems like a weird way to bribe someone"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Eh sometimes they're really cool charts and stuff

I'd much rather not add another rule for the mods to delete stuff

-Butt-Fumble-,"The surgeries are a valid argument

But 'hurr durr 0-6' is retarded. He was on a 2-14 team with **no** talent on offence to help him out and yet he looked like a normal rookie

He had stats comparable to Bridgewater and better than Carr. But while playing he had that 'it' factor that Carr looks to have. I honestly think Mett could've ended up as the best QB of this draft class but the Titans are totally pissing his future away if they don't trade him

Because no matter what. He could outplay Mariota in training but there's no way the FO is going to let their #2 shiny new toy not start with anything baring an injury"

-Butt-Fumble-,"Aight man

The Colts balls weren't all tested but depending on the gauge 3/4 were under the legal limits too. They didn't test more because apparently it was a time issue. But then a ball boy who spent 90s in a bathroom deflated 11 of them near perfectly?

Funny how months ago this subreddit *laughed* at that as 'evidence' and all said it's pretty clear he just took a piss and maybe checked his phone

Brady did absolutely lie about knowing who the ball boy was. But that's not evidence he asked them to do anything illegal. Perhaps he just didn't want to be linked to them in case they did something without his knowledge. As they claim in the vague texts months before to have done before by 'giving him watermelons' to piss him off

The 'evidence' isn't exactly 'good'

Now whether that was because they're fans of the team or just wanna sell 'em on eBay isn't known. But it's also known the ball boys fucked with the balls on their own at times.

They use one gauge for the Colts, and another for measurements for the Pats to make them look worse. Because if they both used that one then 75% of the Colts balls were under legal limits too

They said that science doesn't explain the balls but that's because they don't mention the Patriots balls were left out in the rain and the Colts balls weren't which completely explains the science according to the nobel prize winning chemist

-Butt-Fumble-,Glad to see you still delete all your comments
-Butt-Fumble-,This is how I feel when people tell me I'm silly for predicting the Panthers
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh well then just because of the special teams I guess
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah I get Rodgers is great but I'm taking '84 Marino, '07 Brady, '04 Peyton or '84 Montana over him

Maybe that'll change when it's all said and done but for now I'm not going to take Arod just because his passer rating is really damn good"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You know I was once told by this dude *decked out* in Broncos gear that Peyton used to play for the Colts for a while

This guy was in his mid 20s and had *just* found this out. He told me like it was a secret or a unique fact like Favre and the Falcons"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I didn't know much other than looking at his stats, pretty face &amp; hearing him talk about how much he liked watching Brady even *before* he was drafted

But watching him last preseason like holy crap. I know it's only preseason but he's got a great arm and one of the quickest releases in the league for sure

Also sorry Cards bro, if he looked good, we wouldn't gonna trade our 2nd round QB, showing promise, whose contract will be due the year after Tom's expires (and probably retires) for a 1st rounder"
-Butt-Fumble-,Watt without a doubt
-Butt-Fumble-,Ya this is exactly how people viewed Brady in his early years.. minus a runningback though
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm team Mett

He played on the worst team in football and had a passer rating well ahead of Carr, and pretty much tied Teddy's but everyone brushes that off and just says 'lol 0-6' because *now* we can count wins for QBs. Which just makes me wonder if they even watched a single Titans game last year

If he wasn't a 6th round pick everyone would be up in arms about how incredibly stupid it was to draft a QB when they have such a promising one. Yes even with the injury concern, at least give him one more year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Did EJ play that game? I thought Orton was still playing in the 4th quarter

[e] I just checked and it seem Orton never went out and I recall Watkins playing the whole game too didn't he? I can't find anything for a drive for drive though but I don't remember any Bills sitting out"
-Butt-Fumble-,How can I watch it anyways? Canadian here who needs football
-Butt-Fumble-,"You don't know who I used to be? It's not exactly like I hide it

Not many big Canadian Pats users"
-Butt-Fumble-,"As a Canadian, KD is the shit"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah I edited that out before I even saw your comment

But that doesn't change that there's a pretty big consensus Charles &gt; Lynch"
-Butt-Fumble-,This ruins my whole day now
-Butt-Fumble-,Sorry his name rustles my jimmies 100x more than yours does
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya and that interception in the Browns game is misleading

That *easily* could've been 3TDs to 0INTs if the receiver tried *at all* to catch the ball

He looked damn promising"
-Butt-Fumble-,"His roommate did it against both of their knowledge right?

No one will know what happened but she has been proven to have lied about the event before and she's now lost in court 2 or 3 times right? If it's her word against his, I'm going with his"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I don't see any reason to fire him unless you guys get blown out by us again

He's beaten the Seahawks &amp; Broncos recently in the regular season and won playoff games the last two seasons"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm dding tonight but I will Sunday :D!
-Butt-Fumble-,"To be fair there's arguments for TO and Hutson ahead of Harrison. Even Irvin actually

But to me Harrison is #3 all time"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Fuck that's good, why did he agree to that?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yes I understand we can pinpoint times where he came through clutch

But if we can't point to wins as a plus for Montana/Brady then we shouldn't be able to for Peyton either

If we can then Brady's '13 season is his best season and he deserved MVP"
-Butt-Fumble-,For a guy at his age? I'll take a 1st if someone would offer it
-Butt-Fumble-,?
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's because /r/NFL is retarded

They think all Browns/Bills/Jaguar fans are great and all Pats/Seahawk/Eagles fans are terrible

Meanwhile I've seen terrible Titans, Bills, Colts, Bears or any fans really

Labeling fan bases and attacking people based on flair is why I deleted the turtle account"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think you were downvoted for saying Luck but that's totally true

People are getting this question all sorts of wrong saying Culpepper because 15 years ago he had yet to play in the NFL

But even if we're considering his first year, he wasn't considered top 5. He may have played top 5 but people didn't consider Foles top 10 in '13 despite how well he played

So if people will say Culpepper now, and Luck has a good career, people will look back and just throw him in top 5 for sure"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya everyone can say what they want. But we have an unproven prospect who's only shown promise so far

That should scare Brady giving him a shot to go against a relatively poor defence for his first game in the NFL"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The Bills? They haven't even *made* the playoffs in a decade and a half, who knows what they'll be like if they get there

And despite the running love for the Bills I'm not scared of them next year

The Colts however, while still probably sucking to the run, have improved a lot of areas and should be an even better team this year"
-Butt-Fumble-,I hope after the Brady-era ends they go back to the red uniforms
-Butt-Fumble-,"It wasn't *as* amazing but it's the 2nd best rookie WR season since Moss'

I think he'll be around the same level as his rookie year next season"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Trust me I wish it would happen but I have y'all at 11-5

Ridiculously solid team"
-Butt-Fumble-,*boooooooooo*
-Butt-Fumble-,"That was fun, he ripped hard on Luck though"
-Butt-Fumble-,Yeah I have him as the 3rd best ever. Over Irvin even
-Butt-Fumble-,But he didn't play 15 years ago? This would've been the offseason before he started
-Butt-Fumble-,The end of last season they looked *really* good
-Butt-Fumble-,"Vinatieri!

And whoa Charles is super low imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Peyton was probably still argued top 5 but that'd be tough. He had an inconsistent rookie season and then a good second season. I think but he wouldn't have been argued #1 yet, no where close to it because Warner just won a SB with the GSOT and Favre was a still awesome"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Eh.. Idk man

I know not many people here watched/remember early Brady but he was seen as pretty damn special after '02

He lead the league in TD's (only 28 but still more than anyone else, holy crap the times have changed) 

He was looking to be one of the best at leading a drive too by then"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well he just had a down year, if we're going off essentially the 2014 season only there's no way I'd take him over the other QBs I mentioned

Romo was arguably the best QB last year

Big Ben had an amazing year (career best?)

Rivers played MVP level until he was on his *fifth* center because his line fell apart and even after he looked pretty good still 

Luck had a damn good year carrying his team"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Gordon had a good rookie season

But OBJ's is up there for the best ever"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I expected a 2 game suspension which still would've been unfair imo given the 'evidence' but whatever. I knew with public outcry he was going to miss games

But 4 games, biggest NFL fine *ever*, 4th round pick &amp; 1st round pick?

Only an idiot thinks that's a fair punishment

He's gone soft on some guys, and hard on others before. So I didn't know where he'd land but this is damn hard

The only punishment I disagree with more is the Hardy one. The fact he's missed any games is 100% ridiculous"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I mean tbh I think it was the other guys

But it's so clear that no one knows what happened. It will always be a grey area and if he did it, then no matter what nothing will ever be enough

But because we can't know. I take some solace in knowing he's become a better person"
-Butt-Fumble-,I saw a couple Giants fans being upset with taking him though?
-Butt-Fumble-,"He still has a 6 game sample, that's normally enough to see if you wanna see more or not

And if you think Bridgewater's surrounding talent wasn't *way* better than Mett's your mistaken. Wasn't the Titans O-line ranked 31st in the league?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I like watching First Take because I get to know the consensus among the 'facebook fans' without having to read their awful comments

I just kind of imagine it's supposed to be a parody of an analysis"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The scoring system is open to interpretation

It can be seen as who was in control, putting more pressure on, did more damage &amp; who landed more strikes

*But* that only works per round. Not the fight as a whole which is how people are scoring it because they don't understand boxing

The *worst* dumbed down explanation that I've seen is 'It's like in Street Fighter when the time's up, the guy with the most health wins' That's 100% not how any of this works

And then people think they have 'stats' that show Mayweather hit him more and more often. But what people don't understand is [those are as reliable as Spygate and Deflategate](http://www.fightsite.hr/Media/Jones-Gustafsson-stats2.jpg)

In the sense that big fans know how questionable to read into those, but casuals will just accept whatever the commentators and ESPN tells them"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; Brady is a system QB

I haven't heard that said since like '04"
-Butt-Fumble-,*get over here!*
-Butt-Fumble-,haha just checking. I saw you yesterday or the day before and wondered..
-Butt-Fumble-,"Don't blame us for everything *one* fan says

I don't like what he said either. But I don't whine about all Eagles fans when I see one that said Romo isn't a top 15 QB"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The Patriots weren't caught cheating as an organization

I mean *technically* no one was even caught since they never found real evidence"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sketchy stuff happened. I know that. Don't tell me I don't. He lied about knowing them and he should be fined for that

But Jerry Rice literally admitted to knowingly breaking a pretty big rule and no one gives a shit. I'm not sure why it's seen any different for Brady *potentially* breaking a small rule"
-Butt-Fumble-,Please no :(
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya a lot needed to happen for that to become an interception

That was Hopkins though? I expect more out of him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Good* members

Nah but I like ya ChiBears85.. even if you are named after one of the worst defeats in the Pats franchise :("
-Butt-Fumble-,I still hope Ty Law will get in. He was seen as Revis att
-Butt-Fumble-,Add another reason Carr's one of my favourite QB's in the league
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; but unable to suck enough to get a top-tier QB

Ah the Bengals strategy. Have you tried having a mediocre head coach for eleven years who keeps getting carried by the insane talent on his roster?"
-Butt-Fumble-,Luv u bb
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well Big Vince was a shell, it's kinda sorta like the Steelers losing Troy, it's not really relevant

We got Sheard who is proven, Easley who looked the same level as '13/'14 Vince when he played his rookie year and now Brown

So to say we haven't improved our D-line isn't accurate just because we replaced an old legend"
-Butt-Fumble-,Can we not have this here?
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. [](/OAK)Raiders

2. [](/HOU)Texans

3. [](/CAR)Panthers

4. [](/IND)Colts

5. [](/PIT)Steelers

In that order"
-Butt-Fumble-,It's the smartest sport. I love that plays only last 3-10s normally. It makes coaches extremely relevant and a QB's most important tool is his brain
-Butt-Fumble-,Torrey Smith for stopping on the route and letting the DB run into him for a flag
-Butt-Fumble-,I think we'll split with the NFC East but sweep the AFC South
-Butt-Fumble-,"Really? The lying is sketchy

But the star of the franchise giving out autographs to workers doesn't seem to sketchy. If they wanted money why wouldn't he just pay 'em? Is a Brady autographed ball really worth that much?"
-Butt-Fumble-,For the Falcons didn't Schefter or Rapaport tweet it out that it was going to be their first pick?
-Butt-Fumble-,"QB has very little effect on WR production imo

Josh Gordon had by far the best season in '13 but look at his QBs"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Peyton probably wasn't considered top 5 yet

He had a very inconsistent rookie season and then a good second season

15 years ago he had only played the '98 &amp; '99 seasons. It wasn't really until '00 or '01 people started recognizing him as top 5"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wouldn't that effect *both* Wilson &amp; Luck then?

Wilson is 72% and Luck is 77% but sack yardage shouldn't bring them much different than 5% between them still"
-Butt-Fumble-,"But there's not much of a reason not to take it to court then. He can't be suspended for losing in court (which would be *super* unlikely anyways) and then he can just accept the 1 game

The feeling around this is after Kraft said he'd be willing to accept punishment and felt the organization fully cooperated, he was livid with the insane punishment and now he wants as much taken off as possible"
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's not true at all, he showed it to the media at the conference or something"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Damn just lose with grace, otherwise you're only teaching poor sportsmanship

Fighting has no place outside of a ring, the fight in the Super Bowl was pretty disgraceful too

I might be the only Canadian who hates fighting in sports that have nothing to do with fighting

[e] Oh :( I guess /r/NFL doesn't like my thoughts on this either"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh without a doubt

Smith has no reason on this list. I'm just saying I don't think Ryan is a clear choice for top 10 going into 2015"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Fair, I used to be *super* into mma and I'm still a hardcore fan but I don't train anymore and I only watch the main cards for non-UFC events"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. The Rice video made it seem a lot better than what people originally thought but the media flipped out so he got a way worse punishment

I mean his wife was bitchin at him in the lobby and screaming that he was a pussy. They go in the elevator and then we see him dragging her out. Didn't everyone assume that he beat the shit out of her?

Then the video comes out and she runs at him and he throws one punch. That's a lot better than what I thought he did to her. But his punishment got worse just because Fox News freaked out"
-Butt-Fumble-,Easy there Joe Rogan
-Butt-Fumble-,"What? We love the Jays, you can't go to a single sports store without having a shit ton of Bautista stuff everywhere"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well there's absolutely evidence she lied

She said they hit her over the head and knocked her out but she had a brain scan right after at the hospital that should no trauma. She then said she got it wrong and they drugged her but her toxicology screen done right after also showed she wasn't drugged

She *has* lied twice and that's why she was unsuccessful the first two attempts at charging Jameis"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh that's fair. But he still performed decently as a #1
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh no I'd love the Browns to do it, I'm saying I don't want the Redskins"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'll take average considering how bad our line was the last 5 years

But our LBs are *great*, best group of LBs in the league

Jones is good, Nink is solid, great consistency from him

Brown &amp; Easley who knows but if even one comes out good then we're good there

Sheard hasn't played for us yet but that's like saying your run defence will still suck because Suh hasn't played a snap as a Dolphin yet"
-Butt-Fumble-,We lost a secondary but gained a D-line
-Butt-Fumble-,"He was really good from what little we saw of him, but I'm not sure I want him to be starting for us"
-Butt-Fumble-,Didn't he visit the Bills &amp; Fish?
-Butt-Fumble-,I think most people would agree with that
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's fair, but the story keeps changing

What's the report say? Last I heard it was only 1 out of 12 balls?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Rex doesn't like playing us

But he has a shit ton of respect for us, it's one of the reason he's one of my favourite coaches... really wish he left the division"
-Butt-Fumble-,"If an AFL and an NFL team were playing each other, even just the once, it was still a merged league"
-Butt-Fumble-,Troy Brown 2.0!
-Butt-Fumble-,"They didn't at first!

It was only after the 'more probable than not' that the pitchforks came out"
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. It's /u/Fig_Newton_

2. Cam is love, Cam is life"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You had your offence starting though right? EJ never got a single snap and I thought Watkins played the whole game

And everyone says you only sat 3 players"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Fuck it, go full Garoppolo mode next year

At least Brady would be going out off a SB victory"
-Butt-Fumble-,What the fuck is even happening
-Butt-Fumble-,^*when* ^*he's* ^*healthy* ^*:(*
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya imo a fumble that goes through the endzone should be spot of the fumble like any other fumble

It's ridiculous it was so close to a touchdown but becomes a turnover because of a technicality"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm just saying, we've had worse O-line against better D-lines in the division recently. Not sure why you think this years going to be worse than say '09"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I thought there were essentially 3 'big' owners who determined this stuff though?

Kraft, Jerry and someone else I'm forgetting iirc

Kraft was considered Goodell's biggest supporter and for the last couple years there's been concerns about Goodell's job security

Destroying his relationship with Kraft can't be good"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya, I guess because after seeing the week 17 game enough of them seemed excited enough?"
-Butt-Fumble-,I was fully torqued but it didn't last long until I creamed my pants like a cream filled pastry
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah that whole game was fucky

I've never liked the tuck rule. But it's important to note that wasn't even the first time it was used that season. A lot of people think it was made up by the refs on the spot. Glad it's gone though

Now to get rid of the Megatron rule &amp; banning on TD celebrations next"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What's everyone's weekend plans?

I'm going out tonight for my buddies birthday, picked him up some whisky and a teeny rainbow coloured cowboy 'birthday' hat we're all gonna make him wear at the bar

Sunday going to the race track with a bunch of pals to smoke cigars and get hammered"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; But thats why you got Gronk

Imagine Gronk QB sneaking

"
-Butt-Fumble-,"They said it wasn't serious. He's made an entire report with the basis that they were

The Wells report isn't even accurate in some areas eh? He wrote that the tweet saying the Patriots balls were soft and the refs were looking into it was sent during the second quarter. But because it's the internet we can check these things. It was sent at 1am and it wasn't known during the game. But he claims it was"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Hopefully Chandler gets back on the pace he was at in '13 next season

Also is Siliga going to be starting for us? I imagined Easley or maybe even Sheard"
-Butt-Fumble-,I like the Panthers defense. Their secondary really improved the last 8 games and they managed to get a good streak going for a while. Their line is great and I believe this will be Newton's break through season
-Butt-Fumble-,"Eh it goes both ways, anti Pats stuff gets downvoted like shit too"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Honestly I'd put Dallas, Pittsburgh and the Colts ahead of us. But I'd put Denver behind us

We have no run game anymore, the Broncos have questions at O-line &amp; Peyton

I think both teams will be solid but neither will greatly excel on either side of the ball"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah the best answer imo is Fitzmagic

Such a smart player, I expect him to be the next Harbaugh"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I feel the same way, we hate this as much or even more than anybody

You say anything, one side or the other, and you're in downvote hell. But people keep bringing it up. It's in the top 3 posts in the damn free talk thread :("
-Butt-Fumble-,Sorry to hear the mods didn't like your thread :(
-Butt-Fumble-,Not even Brady rumors can stop this hype train
-Butt-Fumble-,In fairness that dude probably isn't on the Bandwagon unless it was last year he became a fan. Because the only Cowboys fans who'd have been called wagoners would be fans for over 2 decades now
-Butt-Fumble-,How was everyone's weekend?
-Butt-Fumble-,"You can't relive your stuff and Pats fans don't really get rustled about Hernandez here. It's not like we supported his murders or anything

[But we have mine in gif form](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--wVFYehTd--/1865f6xuc7wtugif.gif)"
-Butt-Fumble-,New York Times tomorrow morning: *Quantum mechanical uncertainty means Brady murdered 3 children*
-Butt-Fumble-,"But that's the problem

These kids idolize these players, they wanna be just like them. If you're Canadian then you know how into the sport the Parents/coaches get too at the lower levels

There's no reason for the pros to fight and they're just setting a terrible example for kids"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No? We know the ball boys fucked with the balls on their own. They state in the texts that they had one get up to 16pSi to piss off Tom. They acted alone then

There's 0 evidence that Tom's the reason they were bellow legal limits in the AFCCG. Only speculation"
-Butt-Fumble-,What was his purse again 180 million? If I got just 5 million I would never need to work again in my life
-Butt-Fumble-,"Wait I'm super confused at what you're saying?

NFL have the highest attendance rates? That's because the stadium are *massive* in comparison"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Most teams will try for him. He's gonna be cheap and he's got a great ceiling

But he'll probably be a Saint since it seems that's his favourite team"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It was a sexual harassment case right? That's not small

And while it's against the rules, it's apparently a rule the refs have broken multiple times without it being an issue. Schefter called it the equivalent of a 'rolling stop' it's illegal but how retarded would it be if someone gave you a ticket for it, let alone suspend your license "
-Butt-Fumble-,"[](/CAR)Panthers over [](/IND)Colts

I'll drink my piss if this isn't at least the match up"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It's like the bleach thing, the beating his girlfriend with their kids forced to watch inside a car and then what the fucks up with the kidnapping thing of that women? That seems like a whole new level of crazy

Absolutely support him on the field cause he's part of your team. But I can't say I'd be made if he stopped getting so lucky in life"
-Butt-Fumble-,Just UFC or other MMA organizations too?
-Butt-Fumble-,Well fuck
-Butt-Fumble-,No I'm just allowed to have a different opinion
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well they were saying QB1 is as good as QB2 because their QBR is almost the same

I said QBR is a bad way to measure skills and to look more at yards/any or passer rating

Then I got downvoted a lot because I was 'dismissing his point'"
-Butt-Fumble-,I can't believe I've never seen this
-Butt-Fumble-,"I was a kid in the later years of Bledsoe, old enough to remember him but not enough to have him as an all time favourite

Why Megatron over Moss though?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He has Romo outside of the top 10

This list is a joke"
-Butt-Fumble-,We lost a secondary but gained a D-line which is nice
-Butt-Fumble-,"Do you think we don't get downvoted like crazy too? Honestly do you think pro-Pats guys don't get downvoted like hell as well?

Everyone gets downvoted. I don't label it as a fanbase though, that's against the rules, and *that's* why you get downvoted

I'm not slandering you, people like you slander themselves fine"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Nah man 'Pats army' is about dominate this thread don't worry... any minute now..

[e] Top two comments are shitting on Pats fans and you calling it out for the people saying we run the subreddit and get mass downvoted for it"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think the Dolphins are around 8 wins and finally ditch Philbin, then they start to succeed well after

But Tannehill is a pretty decent option right now at QB, I think he'll still be damn serviceable "
-Butt-Fumble-,"Thanks for the kind words. You're pretty great too

I used to always go to these threads early so I could hear about peoples weeks and such. Now most people just PM me. How was yours pal?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. Schefty has said he doesn't think Brady's going to serve a single game, he thinks it'll be dropped

2. If Brady sent out damaging texts to them it should appear on their phone records anyways but you are right that if he goes to court his phone records will be public

3. The NFL would be gambling hard on Brady's phone then. Because they'll get crushed in a court of law with what they have now. Luckily gut feelings aren't considered evidence"
-Butt-Fumble-,Nah wasn't he like a 7th round pick whose never seen a snap? I don't think he's very good
-Butt-Fumble-,"Just so you know the NFLPA asked Brady not to give the printouts of the phone

That's the biggest reason that's a stupid argument for people to make"
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. Flair up homie

2. Brady is an exception, I just figured this would be one hell of an offence"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Eh the Rice video made him look a lot better to me

Instead he threw one punch in self defence and immediately regretted it

If he charged a man with intent to harm and got hit no one's going to call him the victim, so why is she?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"This is a great upgrade though, Palmer's job of staying healthy just got a whole lot easier"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Broncos, Cowboys, Colts and Pats are all gonna miss the playoffs didn't ya hear?

All the 'underrated' teams are going 11-5 though"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Why the Bills over the Jets?

Jets have a better run defence and secondary by a pretty decent margin"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Pretty much 90% of the people wanted it. The mods got downvoted like crazy, deleted the thread and banned me. But it wasn't even my thread!

Also Pacman but I didn't really care too much, mostly just wanted a great fight. I hate that all these *new* armchair analysts who don't watch boxing are so sure it was domination from Floyd"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Apparently the ball boys don't even like Brady much and said they made one ball get to 16pSi one time to fuck with him! that's super illegal

My guess is he noticed, asked them to be softer but why he would ever ask for them to be illegal or even a specific pSi would be pretty crazy to think

Then when the media was taking essentially nothing and turning everything into hell Brady didn't want to give them anything so he lied saying he didn't know them

Brady still lied so he should be fined. But there is ZERO evidence he wanted anything illegal done"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya we've been underpaying him for a while

He's a pretty great dude"
-Butt-Fumble-,Sherman didn't cover #1's for like half the snaps I thought?
-Butt-Fumble-,"As a former rugby player lol

No it is absolutely not. I played it for years in highschool and just after but I don't even know what channel would show rugby here"
-Butt-Fumble-,"lol and people say *we* get hard to talk with on here

Posts a very bold claim, most people don't agree with it, blame the Pats fans only lol"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm not sure what the counter report has to do with this

But without a doubt their report is speculation. I don't think even they would deny that

I don't even know how anyone could think otherwise. Without Brady being mentioned with any doing to do something illegal how could that possibly be anything *other* than speculation"
-Butt-Fumble-,"1. Dennard played as many snaps as I did last season

2. We released Dennard and Arrington, so that tells me the coaches feel our new guys are all step ups

3. We still had a much *much* worse secondary in '11 and we went 13-3 and made the Super Bowl"
-Butt-Fumble-,You've given us too many nice players for the Fish to like you. You're team is closer with us
-Butt-Fumble-,"Our front 7 was better?

LBers were worse and we didn't have Jones"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Our secondary is average right now or at least better than it was from '11-'13 and we made the AFCCG those years

We upgraded our front 7 a lot with Sheard &amp; Brown and Mayo coming back will be awesome for our already great LBer group

And if you pretend we have a runningback then our offence is the same as it was coming off a Super Bowl win*

^^^**Brady* ^^^*may* ^^^*be* ^^^*left* ^^^*out* ^^^*week* ^^^*one*"
-Butt-Fumble-,So #2 is ARod and #1 is Watt
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ugh, I hate the Chive. It's the 9gag of 9gags"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah that's 100% why I care

He said it because it's true it's not too big of a deal and I don't think anything less of him *as a player* for it. But I think less of him *as a person* after stating multiple times that the Patriots were cheaters and it 'doesn't matter if everyone else does it' but then said that it's okay he cheated because everyone else did it?

He just came across like a hypocrite and he won't admit maybe he made a mistake jumping on the hate Belichick bandwagon at the time"
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's what normally makes people upset. Trust me not many Pats fans like the Giants. But I'll recognize talent when I see it

He may be a rookie but last year he *was* the best receiver. That's the best rookie season since Moss and people are *under* selling it. Thinking all he did was one catch but he was amazing time and time again. I'm 100% aboard the OBJ hypetrain"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I get why people are mad about lying and everything

But the 'infraction' that the best 'evidence' for is vague texts and a pretty big assumption

This whole thing is retarded and I just want it to end. I'm going to be salty as fuck when a suspension is given out because it's 100% not warranted

Schefty's had our back. He called it a witch hunt over the NFL equivalent of a 'rolling stop'"
-Butt-Fumble-,Eh there's homers for every fanbase
-Butt-Fumble-,Damn how's that not a fumble?!
-Butt-Fumble-,that's the joke
-Butt-Fumble-,"But don't worry 'cheating is cheating' so this is fair for us

Seriously I'm proud of most Jets fans, they seem to be our only rival who isn't being completely retarded about this"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It didn't make them upset, I think it was even a Pats dude who wrote the comment

It was just too funny not to upvote, like that's the whole story of the last decade and a half Brady wins but the stat record keeps going for the Colts lol"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Watt, Gronk or Cam Newton

I'd love any of those 3 to have gotten on the cover"
-Butt-Fumble-,"lol he gets all made because people are disagreeing with him about a *Packers* QB

Edits in 'DAE Patriots army?!'

It's far more than just us that disagree with him, he's making a bold claim and surprised when not many people agree with him. It's literally a QB of a team most Pats fans really like too"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You're still not understanding that a printout is worse than handing your phone over directly and the length he wanted them for isn't really even the issue

Not giving over something you have no obligation to give isn't an admission of guilt and it can in no way be used as 'evidence'"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I just know like 10 years from now some idiot is going to google and see Brady sat out 4 games, they're not gonna know why except for a 'cheating' scandal

And all of a sudden Brady wont be a GOAT contender anymore because 11/12 balls were 1pSi under.. whereas 3/4 of the Colts balls were too ^^but ^^wikipedia ^^wont ^^mention ^^that"
-Butt-Fumble-,"In fairness, none of them were ^^^/s"
-Butt-Fumble-,He's a fantastic player. But one of the worst people in the league
-Butt-Fumble-,Yeah I guess cause I tend to follow AFC teams more I like AFC players more often
-Butt-Fumble-,"You have no idea how mad I am at you right now

That's legit one of my angriest memories I have, up there with big playoff losses, 4th and 2"
-Butt-Fumble-,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we don't mention those Sun
-Butt-Fumble-,"We cooperated once and still lost our 1st round pick because we videotaped from the wrong angle in a stadium of 80,000 people and 500 cameras going at any given moment"
-Butt-Fumble-,I don't mind him
-Butt-Fumble-,"I hope you're right, but the smartest move already passed imo. Try and get either #19, #20 and Cox

Or #19, #20, their 2nd round pick and their 1st next year

Both of those would've been awesome deals for the Titans but now if Mariota doesn't look good in camp to the point they're willing to trade him his value will plummet

Either way I think the Titans goofed. Seems like they're just gonna piss off all the players who believed in Mett"
-Butt-Fumble-,Sorry guys. Mallett hype!
-Butt-Fumble-,I think it's because you said '*again*'
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm sure this will go over well :( ^^*hold* ^^*me*
-Butt-Fumble-,"What you don't think they got lucky? 

Brady had 4 drops that could've easily been interceptions and Peyton threw 4 interceptions but they still didn't win by a lot in '03

Peyton it took the Pats to fall apart in the second half and also to miss the 4th and 2 play

I wouldn't call that opinion. I'd call that lucky"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I chalk that up to recent fans

They look at his stats and already would put Rodgers ahead of him, although the argument for that isn't getting stronger I guess, but the reason is always 'look at his passer rating!'"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The biggest issue for me is the refs gave us balls at 16pSi according to the report

So they were much further from legal limits than us. It shows the league officials don't even follow or respect this rule, so how do they expect the players to?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm not sure they have anything actually able to be used in a court of law though. Their 'evidence' is vague texts from the months before without clear purpose and their measurements are being torn to shreds by this Nobel Prize chemist

I'm not trying to sound homerish or anything, I'm seriously just not sure if they have anything that can be used in a court of law"
-Butt-Fumble-,Is there anywhere I can see where they are based on ranking? Like their grades they give out?
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'd still take Luck tbh but it's certainly closer than people make it seem

Wilson is efficient as hell"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah he's a safety net if Geno still sucks

Fitz isn't any worse than the Sanchize and they made two straight AFCCG's with him"
-Butt-Fumble-,I can't imagine the Browns are that stupid
-Butt-Fumble-,"It did but Brady was on fire and we had 40s to go 20 yards.. it might have gone differently by that's up for debate

We also beat the Saints with a miracle comeback too, almost did it to the Bengals before the monsoon and the Panthers before Gronk's 'hug' from Luke"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Or maybe because it's obvious to a lot of people why Rodgers isn't at their level yet, that's not really something too many people need evidence to support

But making a bold claim like Rodgers is already the best ever needs some back up

Also to look at your edit you're *only* going by stats. So how low do you rank Joe Montana? Because he's going to dip way down to top ~20 now right? There's a lot more to the GOAT conversation then just passer rating"
-Butt-Fumble-,Can someone smarter than me ELI5 what to take away from this?
-Butt-Fumble-,"McCoy had a bad year behind the best run blocking O-line and he's going to the worst line in the league

They certainly didn't make 'big' improvements to it either

Harvin keeps getting sent around because no one wants him, Marshall is a much better pick up

Both have bad QB's"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I guess it depends, I go there and everyone's plastered having a time"
-Butt-Fumble-,With their D-line and adding Maxwell I don't think Philly is too big of a bold choice
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh for free?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Holy shit, I just realized we got Danny a ring

We got Jules &amp; Gronk rings too, I don't ever have to feel like we failed them

Welker and Woodhead though :("
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's already been fucked though, he's not going to get to start unless Mariota is *awful* and I mean he's gonna have to be bad. Or unless Marcus gets injured

So he won't be able to prove himself

It doesn't matter what he was drafted as, he exceeded that. Brady wasn't drafted to be our starter, nor was Wilson for the Seahawks"
-Butt-Fumble-,That's what I love about them though! So abrasive
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh ya.. sorry bout that

It's awesome to make one but it's heartbreaking to lose a Super Bowl. Easily the worst loss you can ever experience as a football fan"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Haha oh well then, maybe have em run around the house while you move stuff"
-Butt-Fumble-,Ask Belichick
-Butt-Fumble-,Yeah just because Wells found it 'more probable than not' doesn't mean a jury will if there's another side attacking every single argument they have
-Butt-Fumble-,^*Tim* ^*Hortons* ^*is* ^*better*
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's got a shot. They'll probably start Geno unless something weird happens in the preseason

I think they'll give Geno 2 or 3 games to 'prove it' and if he still sucks I expect Fitz to come in and play pretty damn well"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm not necessarily saying that *I'd* take that trade for the Packers but if I'm the Colts, I'm not selling Luck for anything less than that"
-Butt-Fumble-,"A team dies

A nuke is dropped on Cleveland after LeBron wins Cleveland a title this year. It erases the entire team except for Manziel who was checking out bomb shelters"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I don't care what team they play for. I'm not going to let people discredit him just because this extremely biased title/article

% wise he's just a little higher than most. As we already knew he was

But he's so good everywhere else that he makes up for it and he keeps carrying the Colts to wins"
-Butt-Fumble-,Would you be if he turns out to be pretty good?
-Butt-Fumble-,Their defence won't be too bad imo. I think Tomlin will keep em middle of the pack
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm dding so water/pop
-Butt-Fumble-,"Vick comparisons?

I saw AP ones but I haven't seen anyone compare Brady to Vick yet"
-Butt-Fumble-,The CB right?
-Butt-Fumble-,"I like Tebow but he'd suck way more there, the CFL is *way* more pass happy than the NFL"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm down
-Butt-Fumble-,"No just the Pats won't appeal, as far as we know Brady is still appealing"
-Butt-Fumble-,"So like for just one season and they play their best?

I'd still take Peyton, Marino, Montana &amp; Brady over ARod"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Just on paper? Seahawks, Cowboys, Broncos &amp; Eagles(?)

Maybe Panthers could get up there for discussion too

I'd say Jets because they essentially only have one need but QB is a pretty huge whole"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No I mean for any *one* given year

Like '10 was Brady, '11 was Rodgers, '13 Peyton"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Eagles, Chiefs, Giants &amp; 49ers"
-Butt-Fumble-,He's considered as scary as the Rams some say
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh yeah, I didn't mean to come across like I think *you're wrong*, I just wanted to know why so many people are high on the Bills"
-Butt-Fumble-,Imagine DeSean getting a head start at the snaps. He'd be in the endzone every play
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm really high on Derek Carr, I think next season the Raiders are going to shock a lot of people (in a good way, well bad if you don't like the Raiders)

I was so happy they passed on Williams and took Cooper instead"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh right Vereen :( and Riddles

Dear god our back game"
-Butt-Fumble-,Brady 2016!
-Butt-Fumble-,If you think 20% isn't a huge number then you're wrong
-Butt-Fumble-,"*Malcolm

And technically Malcolm Butler, Butler'd the joy away from Sherman"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No he wasn't and that's the issue

Luck was 77% of the Colts yards in '14

Wilson was 73% of the Hawks

Not a huge difference imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I shouldn't say for sure but more just, I think he is"
-Butt-Fumble-,My hype just got fully torqued
-Butt-Fumble-,"God no, few Canadians gave a fuck about a team that hadn't made playoffs in over a decade

That and I've been a fan since the late 90s

Buffalo isn't even a top 5 team in Canada"
-Butt-Fumble-,Has anyone *actually* gotten bothered by the show? They know it's pretend right?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Keep in mind just one season ago this subreddit talked about Dalton the way they talk about Tanne now and talked about Tanne like they do Dalton

That could all change with another season"
-Butt-Fumble-,Also I'm pretty sure they changed it so CFL balls are the same size now too
-Butt-Fumble-,Power to the memes man!
-Butt-Fumble-,"For you guys it's with an A

For the metric people it's with an E"
-Butt-Fumble-,He missed like half the season
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; The majority of Pats fans

No we aren't. There's good fans and there's bad fans

If you see 20/100 Pats fans in a thread being dumb you keep seing it as just 20 bad fans

But that's because you're ignoring we just have big numbers

2/10 Titans fans might be total assholes too. But that's just 20%, the same for us

No single fan base is any worse or better than the others"
-Butt-Fumble-,But accept the EJ who was worse? Behind arguably the worst O-line in the league?
-Butt-Fumble-,"It's pretty good. Most teams would have like 5 options at the 1st round to think about

Each one might effect another teams pick. So that needs to be figured out

All in all 22% is damn impressive"
-Butt-Fumble-,That's it?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Rodgers played *awful* that game too remember. Luck had a horrible weekend too

Wilson can *absolutely* make the tough throws. His deep ball is one of the best in the league"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh well then to be fair that's a fair assessment 
-Butt-Fumble-,I'd actually argue for the Broncos but the Jets have a case for that too
-Butt-Fumble-,Can we have a race between Peyton and Tom to see who's slower?
-Butt-Fumble-,You mean Patriots SB Champion Revis? That Revis? Patriots legend
-Butt-Fumble-,What was the comment about 'Giving him watermelons' about then?
-Butt-Fumble-,My point is there's been 'cheating' for a lot of teams. Why does only one of them get an *
-Butt-Fumble-,"Your offence would become legendary levels if he played as well as he did before

Dez, Witten, Romo, AP and *the* O-line of the league"
-Butt-Fumble-,'FIND 20 EVERY PLAY' was written on his arm
-Butt-Fumble-,"I didn't come into this thread looking for upboats

This had flame war written all over it but I didn't want people thinking this shitty title/article combos was accurate"
-Butt-Fumble-,He is a great leader/captain for our defence. Hightower and even Collins both did great with the play calling so it'll be hard to say who's going to get those duties next season though. But Mayo &amp; Wilfork were the heart and soul of our defence. Hopefully Mayo can fill the space the big man left too
-Butt-Fumble-,I did if youd read my reply to the other guy
-Butt-Fumble-,"Why am I being downvoted for saying that now?

Like 95% of this subreddit puts Jamaal at #1

That's what a general consensus is

[e] The [/r/NFL survery for top RB's](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3293v1/survey_results_top_10_rbs/cq90oh3)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sounds fun, gotta hone your golf skills now if you wanna get into a big firm I guess"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I gotta take Julio

imo he's the best WR in the league when healthy"
-Butt-Fumble-,Will he be considered a LB or Edge Rusher? Or are they not counting those as different things?
-Butt-Fumble-,You actually have one! Didn't they only have it up for like half a day before it stopped letting you make it?
-Butt-Fumble-,Really? I think just based off how near identical their stat lines are and then the difference in the league from then to now being so big. I think Peyton's season is much more impressive
-Butt-Fumble-,"I mean I guess that most stuff in this thread will create flame wars

But this is one that's *really* out of place for something like this"
-Butt-Fumble-,I mean that's obviously not how the draft works (Chip Kelly hoped otherwise) but for a movie it was pretty entertaining
-Butt-Fumble-,"Shady is coming off a bad year behind the best run blocking line. Now he's going to have a great year behind the worst run blocking line? Sure.

It's because the Bills haven't been a threat for two decades so no one cares about them. So now instead of being bad they're just 'underrated' for the last ten years. But because people don't like the Jets they suck and will continue to suck forever"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya Big Ben isn't compared to either as much as they are to each other

Because everyone *needs* a winner in the trade, no one can just be happy that both QBs have been great for their teams"
-Butt-Fumble-,wut?
-Butt-Fumble-,"Dont'a Hightower

Jamie Collins

Derek Carr (Other than the AC/DC group nickname some have given him and ~~Mack~~ Cooper)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What?! No Hernandez had *a lot* of evidence against him!

That's so different. Brady's is *only* vague text messages. There's a massive difference in what you're comparing"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well keep in mind EJ is worse than Geno and Cassel is worse than Fitz

Marshall is arguably top 10 WR and Decker ain't no scrub either

Their O-line is the best in the divison and they have Ivory *and* Riddles to run behind it

The Bills have arguably the worst O-line in the league and a runningback who just had a bad year behind the best run blocking O-line in the league. I have **no** faith in the Bills offence next season"
-Butt-Fumble-,Nearly identical stats. There's certainly an argument for it
-Butt-Fumble-,"Totally relevant!

1. If she's dating someone she might call rape so it doesn't seem like she was cheating in hopes of keeping him

2. Her lawyer/aunt said it had to be raped because Jameis is black. But her boyfriend at the time was black. So she hid him from her family. Calling rape doesn't make it seem like she *wanted* to sleep with a black guy. At least not to her apparently racist family

I'm on your side man. But those are 100% relevant"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; was involved with it

Show me. Please I haven't noticed this amazing evidence you've seen. I know he lied about knowing the ball boys. But show me *any* evidence that says he knew something *illegal* was happening

And not giving over your phone isn't an admission to guilt. It's having rights"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh right how could I forget, the GSOT sure was something"
-Butt-Fumble-,I don't think he's a troll account though
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sheard has been proven though and we only lost a very past prime Big Vince, we improved our line plenty

Also getting back Mayo will be helpful too"
-Butt-Fumble-,Wouldn't even hit the top 100
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's fair, but if our offence is still on a roll think about how many games you would've won if you had Gronk/Brady on your team?

You *did* still go 10-6 after all"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; how players tie their shoes for six months

I mean we *kinda* talked about stuff like that leading up to the Super Bowl with Lynch

That being said I could never miss the season. I love football too much for that"
-Butt-Fumble-,We get 4 SB's and you get 2? Deal
-Butt-Fumble-,Well we also know they inflated them on their own to spite Brady right? I doubt Brady asked for what he was complaining about
-Butt-Fumble-,"So they claimed it was all in fun and has no merit

He claims they are about real events and breaking the rules"
-Butt-Fumble-,I guess Brady since Bill is already a deity ^/s
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. He, Peyton or Brees could easily have a '10 Favre year next season

When age hits, it hits damn hard"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Well the Falcons 2 years in a row would suck

The Saints would be boring

But yes there's so much more I'd want. Raiders, Browns, Texans &amp; Eagles would all be my top choices"

[edit] Personally I'd recommend the Browns or Favre one but these are just my top 4"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What he *allegedly* did

He lied about knowing people. There's still NO evidence he asked anyone to do anything illegal

He should be fined for lying in an investigation. But he shouldn't be suspended games (especially the rumored 4) for lying about knowing the ball boys"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No Mossport Speedway in Southern Ontario

Only one of us is into racing but he got 10 free tickets so we're all pumped to just get drunk and hangout while taking pictures with Ferraris and such"
-Butt-Fumble-,"There's been rumors/speculation the injury started before but just got worsened but no one's seemed to prove that

All in all I still expect Peyton to be fine next year. I don't think he has his '10 Favre year for a bit"
-Butt-Fumble-,I can't wait to watch the Raiders next year. So exciting
-Butt-Fumble-,"RemindMe! 7 months ""Awesome bet you made"""
-Butt-Fumble-,"He was still benched for Brady when Bledsoe could play

Didn't Bledsoe take almost all the snaps in the AFCCG that year? But Brady was still chosen for the SB"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ya I hear it literally all the time about Tom and Dan the Man

People don't mention Dalton because they can't look past the 'LOL DAE DALTON LINE?!' thing about him to recognize he does have talent"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The Jets aren't getting nearly enough attention imo

Marshall, Revis &amp; Cro is a huge score, plus picking up the best player in the draft"
-Butt-Fumble-,Tom doesn't owe the Patriots anything anymore
-Butt-Fumble-,They're good but your defence imo isn't too much better than ours
-Butt-Fumble-,"Or he wanted to have a voice... but yeah no I'm sure you're *totally* unbiased, I don't see you talking shit about Pats fans whoring for karma in like 90% of the threads

Seriously you comment in everything then complain about other people wanting karma?"

As a Ravens fan you should know how much it sucks to have a horribly injured secondary too"

We won a Super Bowl so we can't complain about everyone attacking our guy?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Chiefs? Easy.

Philip Terrence, Devin Ferold, Michael Johnson, Joeseph Lauzon and BJ Knighton"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He might be screwed like Big Vince

O-line and NT's don't get love. Being the best for a long time might not be enough

People talk about Wilfork like he's gonna get snubbed and he's been a huge part of two SB runs

But without a doubt Mangold *should* get in"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; That's only two more passing TD's than Wilson had in his second year

It's a *very* different time. '03 was the big shift towards modern day stats"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Here's my theory. In the report is says [Brady had asked before to have the balls just above the lowest allowed limit.](http://i.imgur.com/s7yn7DR.jpg) Presumably because apparently our balls earlier were on the top end or above the legal limits

The ball boy let out air and let out too much

Everyone freaked out and at the time the media was attacking *anything* they could. Brady clearly lied about knowing them not wanting to bring any more attention to the matter

There's clear evidence he lied about knowing them. But there is absolutely **no** evidence he tried to bribe them or asked them to do *anything* illegal. That's all just been speculation"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh in this thread or you mean a couple days ago? People have been making this joke since we lost Browner
-Butt-Fumble-,"15 years ago, Culpepper hadn't thrown a pass yet, we'd be in the offseason before his first year

Bledsoe would probably be #5 att"
-Butt-Fumble-,But seriously why is it okay that NFL officials gave us balls *way* over the legal limit. But slightly deflated requires a witch hunt
-Butt-Fumble-,"On paper they might be the best defence next year

Combine that with a good O-line, Decker &amp; Marshall and they have a decent shot for sure"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What why?

My opinion is my opinion but I'm wrong because I have stats? I didn't realize there were stats that were the end all be all for rankings. You should tell people so we can solve this thread"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Revis should have nothing to do with it. We went 12-4 in '13 &amp; '12 without him and 13-3 in '11 essentially no defence

We lost a secondary but we gained a D-line this offseason

I think we'll go anywhere between 10-6 and 13-3 this year depending on the Brady suspension and how Garoppolo looks"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Alright, I'll take over for Belichick. I got this, hold my beer"
-Butt-Fumble-,But there's guys who slip through even the UDFA's or just never really get a shot at a NFL camp and go to the CFL
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh I'm sorry, I thought you meant that in case you forgot them but you had still ordered them

Just a miscommunication on my part sorry"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt;I'd take Ryan over Newton and Ryan for sure

Damn. I didn't realize this subreddit loved Ryan so much they'd take him even over himself

I wouldn't even hesitate for Wilson or Flacco over Ryan. Newton I'd pick but it'd be closer"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He's not too bad, sometimes he gets homerish but we all do

He's cool in my books"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Those fans are retarded. The Colts have nothing to do with under inflated balls for the Pats

I think he might mean revenge against the league, more than the Colts"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Newton's character wasn't being questioned. No one cared about the laptop thing

People have been high on Winston"
-Butt-Fumble-,No but what's important is that I can *assume* he did
-Butt-Fumble-,Because Watt did more despite 1.5 less sacks
-Butt-Fumble-,"I quite like Sherman, one of my favourite players because he says what's on his mind"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The night courage wore orange? I wasn't embarrassed at all. We only lost by 1 and it was totally heart warming to see a team come together like that

We *did* still finish the season 14-2 and win the Super Bowl so that kinda helped with the loss too"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yup. People have been telling me Belichick should be banned and Brady shouldn't be allowed in the Hall of Fame over this or Brady can never be considered the GOAT now

And not just by casuals sadly

Lots of people think the report has *any* evidence that Brady asked someone to do something illegal. But there's *nothing* that even suggests that. The vague texts only make it seem like the ball boys would tamper with balls to piss off Tom and over inflate em and that on one day after the Baltimore game he signed footballs for them

How people have run with this is horrendous"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm not talking about quantity stats though

Wilson INT% is much lower. Just because he didn't *have* to carry his team doesn't mean he can't. It's exactly how people talked about Brady in the early/mid '00s and then we've seen him now be able to carry very shitty teams"
-Butt-Fumble-,Kraft whose side are you on?! We're supposed to be going to war!
-Butt-Fumble-,"It's possible, but I like to imagine it's better just to trust I was a fan in the Bledsoe era"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; As of the 2014-2015 season

Did you not read OPs question?

Revis will be inducted as a Jet but the last season he was a Patriot"
-Butt-Fumble-,We're becoming the first 'circle' defence in the league!
-Butt-Fumble-,"No you called him a jackass and saying ""it was a joke so calm down"" is very demeaning

There was no confusion in tone"

-Butt-Fumble-,"It's not a real one, it's a photoshop... thank god cause this is uuuuuggggglllly"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I just wanna say 95% of our fans know this website is garbage and useless. Please do not think he reflects us all

-Butt-Fumble-,"That's fair. I just don't think he was top 5 after his second season because

Warner just won a SB with the GSOT

Favre was looking great and had played many years

Bledsoe was having a bunch of success and had multiple seasons under his belt

McNair was highly thought of

Rich Gannon was easily top 5

Aikman was still playing at a decent level but I wouldn't call him top 5 either

Brunell was easily higher than Peyton att too

There were a fair amount of options at the time

Peyton was top 10 but I think it's a big stretch to say top 5. Even if he played top 5 he wasn't considered top 5"

She's super hot and way out of my league but she's a lot of fun to hangout with and one thing led to another. But there's this girl I'm crazy about and I gotta find a way to get into a relationship with her. So until then nothing serious with these other ladies.

Is Bradshaw close to Brady on the all-time rankings? Not even slightly"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I agree with you on the Bills at least

They're the least complete team in the division by a pretty good margin imo

If it's not the Pats I think the Jets take the division"
-Butt-Fumble-,"He most likely lied about knowing them and he didn't cooperate with the investigation

*But* neither did Favre with 'sextgate' and he only got a 50k fine. So why the fuck is Brady going to miss games"

-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah. I mean Brady threw 4TD's and 0INT's on your defence last year in a single game

Let's say Jimmy throws 3 against the Steelers and 2 against you guys. That'd still be a damn good first 2 games"

And the 9ers, Fish and Raiders having a better offence than the Colts &amp; Pats seems very *very* silly"
-Butt-Fumble-,Would you if 18 of the losses were also in a Super Bowl though?
-Butt-Fumble-,You know this isn't the first year they've all had amazing D-lines right?
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; Why would Brady lie about such an easy thing to disprove though? It just doesn't add up if he didn't ask him to do anything illegal. 

Okay see now this is what I hate. This is the mentality that so many people are stuck on and will not budge. So please I'm going to write  a lot but please read it all and just try reading it as a person, not as a fan of a division rival

He lied about knowing someone. We all have no idea why. But the *most likely* scenario is that he was doing something illegal?

Okay. Here's my huge issue with this. If you read the report you'll know that there's a section where it states Brady had previously asked for it to be at just above the lowest legal limit

So what we know is: During that week the media was trying to twist anything and everything and were trying to make every stupid scenario look awful for the Patriots

Let's say Brady knows he's asked the ball boys for softer balls. If he said ""Yeah I know the ball boys, talk to them every week about how I want the balls prepared for the game"" you don't think they're going to scrutinize him beyond belief for that?

Maybe he thought just saying no he doesn't affiliate with them would be easier because no one would really care

'B-but he didn't give over his personal phone records!' That's what I hate to a *huge* degree. [Staying within your rights, FOR WHATEVER REASON, is not an admittance of guilt and should not and can not be used as 'evidence'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyW48QlB2s)

The truth is they got nothing. They have absolutely *no* real evidence. Every single thing in the report is speculation and assumptions but people are looking at this 'scandal' like it's black and white when the entire thing is grey. If they had real evidence that proved anything they wouldn't be saying 'probable'

The Colts balls were also under deflated and yes it was less of a drop than ours but it was still a very tiny difference between ours

A ball boy going to the ballroom is not evidence that the star QB was orchestrating an illegal operation. It's probably just evidence he had to pee at halftime. That's not really hard evidence that should be used to suspend a player for 1/4th of the season and take away a first round pick

The integrity of the game was never an issue. This subreddit kills me with this crap. Someone posted the thread about both the Panthers/Vikings tampering with balls midway during the game and the top comment was 'if it has essentially no effect and everyone's doing it who cares?' and I agree comparing off the field and on the field stuff is dumb. But the Falcons pumping noise is on the field. 'Cooperating' wasn't the different for them getting a slap on the wrist. The Patriots and Broncos both cooperated fully with Spygate and Spygate II but the Patriots lost a 1st rounder and the Broncos got told 'please don't do it'

It's super easy to just go with what First Take is saying, but it's not always going to be what's the best way of judging everything

This whole dumb report and investigation was a witch hunt. They couldn't find good evidence so they speculated about everything they could possibly find. A star signs some stuff for employees? Obviously he did it to get them to slightly deflate the footballs just bellow legal limits! Or maybe they just wanted signed gear? If Brady wanted to bribe people wouldn't he just use money?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sorry man :( can't post First Take and expect upvotes though

It make as well be a dank meme"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I have no idea what he said but your comment intrigues the hell out of me

Also sex with socks on &gt; Sex with bare feet"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yeah I'd want Flacco, Newton or Eli above Smith easily

Eli gets shit on by the sub but he had a great year last year"
-Butt-Fumble-,"But that's all anyone talks about!

I know he was Peyton's super kryptonite but he's much better than just that

He was an amazing corner for so many years"
-Butt-Fumble-,"The thing is though, everyone has the Bills doing great and the Jets sucking cock but if you compare them

The Jets have a better run defence, better secondary, *much* much better O-line, better QB options (not by much but still), great runningback depth &amp; better receivers

They aren't going 4-12 again, they're at least 8 wins imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'm one of the highest speakers of OBJ but I can't believe a rookie beat out Gronk for the cover vote :(
-Butt-Fumble-,Did Luck have a higher ranking than Brady? I think Brady makes tomorrows lists
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm glad Bountygate was handled well and fairly then

Oh wait.."
-Butt-Fumble-,"For real though does he have a shot at the NFL Top 100?

Or does that always go to the MVP?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Yes he's played snaps but mostly in garbage time

*But* what my lovely Bills fan is over looking is

Garoppolo played against the Bills starters in week 17. *With our backups*

Interesting to note that he out performed both Rodgers' &amp; Peyton's performance against the Bills just weeks before. Without our starting cast to help him out

Pats fans know to take that with a grain of salt. But we also know it means our guy is showing promise. He's got a lot going for him

This guy literally said it's silly to think Winston *or* Mariota will be better than EJ Manuel next season. He's maybe just a little extremely biased lol"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think the Redskins will only end up with RG3 getting ripped by the media and Dan Snyder being a cock on TV

The only good thing that could come out of it is putting the name 'Redskins' in the spotlight and maybe helping get them to change it"
-Butt-Fumble-,Fitzmagic would be my guess
-Butt-Fumble-,"Moss didn't exactly have stars throwing to him most of his career. He made Culpepper

Josh Gordon got 1600 yards in 14 games with 3 difference scrubby Cleveland QBs throwing to him

I don't think there is much of a correlation that the QB necessarily makes the WR, at least certainly not at the elite level"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I'm saying compare Luck right now after 3 years and he's laughed about being #5

Peyton was only at 2 years and only really had one good year, that doesn't make him top 5

Warner just won a SB with the GSOT

Favre was looking great

Bledsoe was having a bunch of success and had multiple seasons under his belt

McNair was highly thought of

Rich Gannon was easily top 5

Aikman was still playing at a decent level but I wouldn't call him top 5 either

Brunell was higher than Peyton att too

-Butt-Fumble-,"No one thinks he's the GOAT, that's not even an option. He doesn't crack top 50 all time yet

The game manager thing is silly but yeah it exists unfortunately "
-Butt-Fumble-,"Because the Bills have sucked for so long they aren't a threat so now instead of being bad they're just 'underrated'

It's the same with the Browns and Rams. Used to apply to the Texans too"
-Butt-Fumble-,I'll hold it but I might drink it
-Butt-Fumble-,"That's the thing though. Bill wasn't involved nor was Kraft

Payton is a *very* different case. There's evidence of him going out of his way to cover it up and lying about it

There's literally nothing to suggest any of the FO knew this was going on for the Patriots"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It bothers the hell out of me when people throw stats to say they're the same when the eye test shows there's a reason Peyton has failed so many times in the playoffs (and it's not his damn defence)

He's amazing in the regular season, probably best ever, but he just isn't as good in the playoffs

Midway last season there was a top 5 playoff QBs and the top 6 answers had left Brady out and 4 of them had Peyton in.. I just don't understand sometimes"
-Butt-Fumble-,I really hope he makes the Hall one year

-Butt-Fumble-,"A *surprising* amount don't

I know a lot of reddit is younger and didn't watch prime Favre, they only know the INT circlejerk (which % wise isn't even much worse than Peyton's and he played in a harder time so idk why people think that) but I've seen *Packers* fans who say Rodgers has passed Favre all time already

I think the Jets go 11-5

And sure, I think the Pats win the division, but there's also people predicting the Pats to go from SB champs to worst in the division with little reason for why

I don't label all Bills fans, and you shouldn't do the same with us. Maybe you're being downvoted because you're being to biased towards your own team, or to biased *against* another

But that's a damn huge risk. You'd have to be *certain* Brady's phone has something that for some reason he talked about with someone not one of the two ball boys Maybe he asked Siri about ball pressure who knows. But if they go to court and there isn't real evidence on Brady's phone...

I'm normally last on the 'fire Goodell' train but man he'd not only shoot himself in the foot, the bullet would've bounced off and hit him between the eyes. Because there's 0 chance they could win in court with what they have now"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Either Brady or Peyton

*Way* more Bronco Peyton jerseys than Colt ones though but then again the NFL is the fastest growing sport in my country so the newer fans will probably remember him a Bronco"
-Butt-Fumble-,Classy username
-Butt-Fumble-,"*boooooooo* for your 1a-d

How am I supposed to flame you if you don't give me solid numbers?!

But ya I like the list. Marshall/DeSean is my other option for 10 instead of Tate"
-Butt-Fumble-,"It's ok

Sorry if I was snarky friend"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I essentially had the Titans logo but just a pink circle on fire

I wanted a logo to go with my dumb team name

I also would make a runningback called Jun Juners'un and make him tiny as fuck with huge arms/feet and max every stat for him"

Evil League of Evil and what not"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I hope so too, but I think the FO knows Fitz can't be long term solution and Geno has a shot because he's young still

They'll try him out at least once more I'm sure of it"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Dany isn't supposed to be a good leader or a smart person. That's what not a lot of people have missed

She's supposed to be the *obvious* good character. With a noble heart. In season 1 you're supposed to think 'Oh clearly she's the best for the throne' but the reality is that doesn't make a good leader at all. You're supposed to recognize how much she fails throughout the series. She forces her ideals because she believes she's always right. It's why the two cities she's conquered before completely fell to shambles after she left and are worse off than ever

She's marrying this guy because she's realizing she doesn't have any control over Meereen's people/rebellions and this guy might. She would never dare burn him alive or else she would start an all out war killing 3/4ths of the cities population easily

Daario is completely 100% done *wrong* than in the books. I'm not normally one to complain about that. She loves him because he's so unique and his own person. He's not supposed to be generic warrior/heart throb #1. He's supposed to be chubby, with long *bright* blue hair, mustache and beard, as well as a gold tooth. She also sends him away to go fix her mess in her last city (she does this in the show but apparently it only took like 2 episodes for him to go back to the old city and fix everything, he's not returned yet in the books)

Arya is cool, she has a lot going for her character just you wait

Jon is the ultimate guy right now but hopefully they'll introduce who *I* want to get on the iron throne next episode"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Sorry just saw now

I actually love Favre, he's my favourite non-Patriot player ever. He was a staple to my childhood. I'm only saying I know more about him than the 16 year old Packers fans who've really only seen ARod or the last years of Favre, not prime Favre

And the 'DAE Pats' stuff wasn't brought up by me, OP edited his post and threw that in there blaming us for the fact that very few people agreed with him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"This is literally what we're talking about though

He's good enough they'll make the playoffs but because of that they'll be scared to get a new QB or a new HC whereas if they had one less win and missed the playoffs then it'd be pretty obvious to axe him off

Not bad enough to replace, not good enough to win the big one. The Bengals"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; false rape accusations are not very common

Really? They're pretty common up where I'm from. In highschool we used to have assemblies on why it's not okay for women to do this it's become such a problem

Now I pretty much wanna get it written out on a contract before I touch a woman because of how terrifying the idea of getting accused of rape is. You're totally fucked if you're a guy 99% of the time, even if you aren't found guilty the time and money you'll have to spend hurts deep"

-Butt-Fumble-,Did you read the counter Wells report?
-Butt-Fumble-,"No but it's so likely I don't mind him being fined. He's clearly talked with them. According to Tedy he doesn't know their names but instantly knew their faces. So who knows. He should've said he had talked with ball boys about pressure before

But there's absolutely no evidence he asked anyone to do anything illegal"
-Butt-Fumble-,Oh well then never mind
-Butt-Fumble-,Fuck you so hard
-Butt-Fumble-,"Text messages?!

The guys say those texts were 100% joking in fun and they have no relation to any illegal activities. But the report just assumes that they're lying about that

It's far from 'proof' of Brady asking them to do something illegal. They're extremely vague and being portrayed in a bad light

Lying about knowing someone is not an admission of guilt"
-Butt-Fumble-,"[](/HOU)Texans go 10-6

3800 yards 
64% completion
30 TDs 
18 INTs

He'll look very similar to Stafford imo"
-Butt-Fumble-,"No I genuinely thought there's supposed to be 3 owners who have the most say with the commission aren't there?

I thought it was Jerry who picked Goodell as commissioner even

I'm sure Irsay &amp; Woody are thrilled with the punishment right now but if this goes to court (which it's looking *very* likely) they aren't going to have any sort of say"
-Butt-Fumble-,"If accusations were always the truth I'd be gay

Reality: Am Straight"
-Butt-Fumble-,Ouch :l
-Butt-Fumble-,"Favre lied and failed to cooperate with his scandal too

So they gave him a 50k fine. Why is Brady so much worse?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"**Offence**

1. [](/PIT)Steelers
2. [](/GB)Packers
3. [](/IND)Colts

**Defence**

1. [](/NYJ)Jets
2. [](/CAR)Panthers
3. [](/SEA)Seahawks"
-Butt-Fumble-,"You can say that but idgaf about the Bills or Fish, the Jets scare the shit out of me

Pats went from 5-11 to a Super Bowl before so last seasons record doesn't mean squat"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Luck has a shit ton of potential though, I think he'll end up being just as good or higher than Rodgers in the all time when it's all said and done, maybe around ~15 or so

He just needs to fix the turnovers and then he'll be godly"
-Butt-Fumble-,Gronk doesn't seem smart but he certainly seems fun
-Butt-Fumble-,"Brady knew the guy, they reference Brady talking about him. I think he lied about that

But he didn't ask them to do anything illegal that we know of. Which is what's being spread around"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I haven't seen it before mate, you're fine"
-Butt-Fumble-,Greg Hardy even with the 'issues'
-Butt-Fumble-,What if they're a Packers fan? Not everything needs to be a homer pick
-Butt-Fumble-,No fuck this whole offseason
-Butt-Fumble-,"Ryan is a talented dude, but that doesn't mean I'm going to just give him more credit because he doesn't have the best line

There's plenty of QBs with worse lines (Russell Wilson for sure) and having Julio and Roddy is a pretty huge fucking help. He used to have Gonzales recently too

Poor defence is for sure there but I'm not considering defences a factor in best QB"
-Butt-Fumble-,"What when?

The '85 Bears went 15-1

I could be wrong about the 9ers though

[e] Oh the '84 49ers"
-Butt-Fumble-,This is about one of the newest stars in the league. And you don't want us to talk about it?

-Butt-Fumble-,"I must have been the only toddler plumped down in front of football rather than Hockey as a kid

Well in Canada"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Right?

Reddit loves arguing 'cops shouldn't be able to search your car or phone'

Oh but this PI wants Brady's personal phone records and he won't hand em over? *Clearly* he's murdered six children. We can't say he hasn't but it's 'probable' since we can't disprove it either"
-Butt-Fumble-,But May 7th is tomorrow!
-Butt-Fumble-,Why is that? Just wondering
-Butt-Fumble-,Amazon
-Butt-Fumble-,"Oh I see, I understand his comment now

I just feel so bad for Mett :( They won't trade him because they know he's shown promise but now he won't get to play even though it seems the players like him"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I think you're arguing in circles with people because you don't seem to have a clear grasp of what's going on, more just want to make Brady look bad and repeating stuff you've heard other people spew"

2. He's already the star of the Bucs"
-Butt-Fumble-,"[Not giving over your personal phone records is not the same as not cooperating with an investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyW48QlB2s)

It just means he stayed within his rights"
-Butt-Fumble-,"I mean your secondary really came together at the end, the line is amazing, Newton is love, good receiver &amp; star TE

I know the O-line needs work but y'all don't have many holes. Remind me a lot of the '13 Bengals (but with a better QB &amp; worse O-line)"
-Butt-Fumble-,"&gt; If he had nothing to gain by telling the truth why would he lie and risk suspension?

Did you not turn on any sports outlet during that week? It was a witch hunt for the Pats. Saying he had any relation with the ball boys would've gotten him ripped apart by the media at the time

I'm not arguing it's okay. He lied. And the punishment for lying during an investigation is a 25k fine, that's already a standard in the NFL. But he's going to get suspended? Explain to me why he's getting extra punishment?"
-Butt-Fumble-,"Everyone's saying he doesn't do punishments anymore?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE!?!

But seriously even if he did it wouldn't change my view of him, he's done good elsewhere "
-Butt-Fumble-,"I picked up the banjo in like a day after playing guitar for just under a decade att

-Butt-Fumble-,"No

BAH_GAWD_KING_,YOU GUYS ITS HAPPENING ITS REALLY HAPPENING
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"For real, unbiased facts directly from the report, look at my most recent post. I took a lot of important facts and quotes from the report and posted them somewhere you won't get down voted into oblivion"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah haha i miss it, i wanted to start it up again after i finish up these PFF grades are all done. 

i just like staying productive during offseason and making it easier for everyone.

I was going to release the WR grades but I haven't had time. Ill be working on it all night tonight and have them out hopefully tomorrow."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm not saying he can't let off steam. Sure, go for it. But to yell at your coach is a pretty bad thing. If you've ever played on a team you'd know that. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Just wait till the cumulative scores tomorrow it'll be much more accurate! :D
BAH_GAWD_KING_,[Ronnie brown I miss you](https://youtu.be/x1NMm38th7o)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I believe the only way is if he steps down as commish, or gets voted out with like 2/3+ majority vote from owners. I doubt it'll happen though to be honest "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,its Very possible 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I just don't understand that logic. Only through trying extremely hard to find context other than actual deflation would someone say that for weight loss. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You know the thing about some homeless people is they have a good sense of self. I remember I delivered a pizza downtown and I was walking back to the car and dropped my wallet full of cash. Homeless man picked it up and returned it to me. I was so shocked. I offered him money but he wouldn't take it. He just asked for a few cigarettes. I bought him a pack and still gave him a 20. Talk to him all the time. He has the best stories. You're right it'd be insulting, I couldn't do it"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,MY EYES!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Brady is 38 when the season starts. I don't see him being in the NFL past 2017 or 2018 at most honestly 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lemuel jeanpierre. Timber creek highschool 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,[PFF](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Damn I'm usually good at catching the references, as you can imagine i get them a lot haha "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah and I'm sure you read deflate as losing weight too huh? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No way that's true. The pats are way more hated. In every single thread about most hated teams or which team people want to fail, pats outweigh every team by a margin. victim complex growing stronger"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fair enough 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm giving you facts, I'm giving you exactly what's in the report how am I not discussing it? Lmao wtf

And he actually did meet jastremski because he specifically said ""we don't talk about game preparation unless it's in person"" soooo yeah, there's that. Anything else you want me to refute?

And if there's no tone then you're just speculating that's what brady meant. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damn Jags Showin em how to pick! That pick was in almost instantly! They have to grab Williams at this point! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Center- Pouncey 
LT - Albert

BAH_GAWD_KING_,There really weren't any first round Busts after Manziel was picked...
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I get the counter argument thing. But that comment is made to bring stupidity and arguments
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yup. Live in orlando, can confirm. All it does is bring tourists and traffic to my fucking neighborhood. Not to mention UCF and valencia sucking up every job in the world and adding more traffic"

BAH_GAWD_KING_,Second* but 3rd is fine with me at least we aren't the jets and last

BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's cool let the victim complex in this sub go nuts.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah it's gonna be annoying, not just that but just commenting any opinion you have that's against pats fans opinions isn't going to go well for the rest of us"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tannehill. He'd have manning and Marino there for any advice needed. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"That's probably the worst thing I've heard, nobody uses deflate as weight loss. Even if you put that context into the texts, it only makes sense for the jacket one. Other than that it doesn't at all. Seems like the worst explanation someone could come up with for the word"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because he won't do it. His account is only 4 hours old
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Is finesse the word you're looking for? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What team was worse than the roster YALL have now? I can't think of any
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Doesn't hurt that jimmy has a +3.1 grade in Run blocking
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Then why lie in the first place? I'm not saying he did anything I'm just saying it looks bad to lie about something as small as that
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What's your Twitter name
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I agree it is just a nickname. But I have been calling Josh Gordon, flash for a few years. I thought it was well known. Again, not a big deal. Just a nickname"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Or you know do the moral thing and say something. A lot of coaches like a person with character. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jets got us all destroyed i hate it 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I don't expect it but I can see it happening 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Honestly just too much to keep up with. I don't know the divisions or what rules are different. I also feel like the only games I've watched were just good offenses against bad defenses or vice versa. Felt like I was watching arena football. I really really wish I could get into it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Does it even matter anymore? I'm sick of justifying the fact that he's been found guilty of breaking the rules by the NFL and is now going to be suspended. Nothing any of us say will change that. It's done. No point to try to convince me why he didn't do anything wrong because in the end brady is still suspended. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I wouldn't call that line stacked
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i figured, you were like my favorite pats fan on this sub. Back on my old account we had a few decent discussions. I remember you being in like every thread just like I was too "

BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeldon?? Surprised the fuck out me? I like Abdullah way more
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Chargers got fined, and also there was no rule against the towel scandal. They also owned up to it with no prior incidents.

The panthers, also owned up to it, also with no prior incidents. They said they didn't know it wasn't allowed and its clear since they did it on the fucking sideline in front of 70k people"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Please don't bring this conversation in here I need a break from it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Still working on it. I added tons of stats so it's taking a while to get used to. And I added TEs so it's take even longer. Lol I only have about 3 Divisions fully done. I want to say it'll be ready by Sunday. Dude fuckin steve smith had the most broken/avoided tackles last season. How the hell? lol dude is still a beast even at like 37 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We don't even know how bad the injury is. It literally could be a sprain and they told him not to put weight on it as a precaution. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why would the jets move up 1 spot for petty lol they have Bortles.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Please let trae Waynes fall to us! Please God! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Its cool, we've all been there"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Who we gonna beat? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damn looks like Derek rose's dream of being the Eagles QB is over 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Fact is the wells report concluded that he more than likely had something to do with it. All you can do is wait for the punishment. Salt or not, there's nothing that can be done "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ugh I hate the stache. Love Rodgers but the stache is ugly. Reminds me of Kyle ortons stache. Made me me want to punch him in the mouth

BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Fair, i could see that"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The cumulative more accurate OL positional table is coming tomorrow, this is more of individual player, the total is almost irrelevant without adding in depth play"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He could have given them to his lawyer though. Even if he gave them the texts and there was the same outcome, he could still take it to court and have a less bias opinion. I honestly, in my opinion so no reason for him to not have done this. My view is if you have nothing to hide then we should be all good. Because in the end, those texts, damning or not, will come out. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You mean the one player that admitted to not knowing that games end in ties? Brady didn't read the rule he was pushing to be amended? Take off the homer glasses 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"In the offseason, yes"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"because there is no context to it? How come every pats fan can say we can't talk about the texts because theres no context, but when some pats fan acts like they were in the room with brady when he talked to mcnally, its fine even with no context besides 2 people saying brady did know. 

 I said in my OP that ""Honestly, there is nothing definitive in the entire report, but there are a lot of damning things in it.""

&gt;Rule 2

 The Ball

**Section 1**
BALL DIMENSIONS


The Ball must be a “Wilson,” hand selected, bearing the signature of the Commissioner of the League, Roger Goodell.
**The ball shall be made up of an inflated (12 1/2 to 13 1/2 pounds)** urethane bladder enclosed in a pebble grained, leather case (natural tan color) without corrugations of any kind. It shall have the form of a prolate spheroid and the size and weight shall be: long axis, 11 to 11 1/4 inches; long circumference, 28 to 28 1/2 inches; short circumference, 21 to 21 1/4 inches; weight, 14 to 15 ounces.
The Referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game.


**Section 2**


BALL SUPPLY

Each team will make 12 primary balls available for testing by the Referee two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game to meet League requirements. The home team will also make 12 backup balls available for testing in all stadiums. In addition, the visitors, at their discretion, may bring 12 backup balls to be tested by the Referee for games held in outdoor stadiums. For all games, eight new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer to the Referee, will be opened in the officials’ locker room two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game. These balls are to be specially marked by the Referee and used exclusively for the kicking game.
In the event a home team ball does not conform to specifications, or its supply is exhausted, the Referee shall secure a proper ball from the visitors and, failing that, use the best available ball. Any such circumstances must be reported to the Commissioner.
In case of rain or a wet, muddy, or slippery field, a playable ball shall be used at the request of the offensive team’s center. The Game Clock shall not stop for such action (unless undue delay occurs).
"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah well no crap lol who was captain? He said ""thanks captain for the crab legs"" or something like that "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yanda is by far the best G in the league 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Funny how this gets upvoted and other people saying they like this happening are getting downvoted. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,BAH GAWD KING AS GOD AS MY WITNESS THAT MAN HAS BEEN TORN IN HALF
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The year before grimes had given up 0. This year our entire secondary was injured after week 6. Can't blame grimes for holding it down
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Crazy how even a pats fan can't talk bad about the pats without being downvoted. I got hack your back buddy. Not even talking bad. Just speaking the truth, I can dig it"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Or how irrelevant the seahawks have been in history. We can talk about history. Cause that's part of the NFL. And the 49ers have the second most SUPERBOWL wins in the NFL.  At 5. Seahawks have one. 

You make fun of a injured Wr but watch sherman or wilson get hurt and you won't think it's funny when he isn't himself anymore "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's not only Byron that included your depth at LT. But Byron bell I believe was a -33ish 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,DL*
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I answered this is a previous thread, he used to play a lot of soccer and told the coach if they needed him to he would be their emergency kicker. Suh played soccer up til highschool because his mom said football was too dangerous. Oh the irony."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Had a pats fan tell me the other day that the patriots are the only dynasty ever. So there's that. I have respect for most fans on here cause they own up to the negatives. But that was just bad. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,nope! Sorry man!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Just happened. Lol 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And he's passed for 2000 more yards than RW has in his career. What's your point? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Good point. Great line last year to protect him but it wasn't even the full healthy line. And sanchez did pretty well. It'll be cool to see what happens 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"To me it never matters how the person cheated. If they cheated, they cheated. Shouldn't matter to what degree unless we are talking punishment"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Good idea. I'll think about it. I most likely not remember by next time hah. I'm always so drained by the time I'm done making them because I work on them so late 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"nah you're right hah, just a change, see how it goes. Didn't think people would realize. also if you're a long time /r/nfl user, you might remember my old more ""reddit famous"" account /u/DollfinJesus. I did all those 'Daily Schedule Threads last offseason"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,BAH GAWD KING IS THAT THE COWBOYS OL MUSIC?! THEY WERENT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Definitely agree. I haven't been this hyped about having a QB in...15 years...fuck me....
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ah ok thanks! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I definitely see that. If Geoff Schwartz comes back healthy, your OLine will be impacted immediately. Also cruz coming back, and randle not being forced into wr1 all season will help loads. Really like the Giants recently. If I'm not mistaken, was JPP injured last season? I can't remember but I feel like it was towards the end of the season. I hope he comes back like a boss. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Which were tested then deflated after the fact
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I like edelman but Jarvis is so fresh and i fuckin love the guy and how played last year. If you haven't yet [watch his highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNw7j9yef0) skip about a minute in to get through the college ones and you'll see how athletic this kid is. Haven't see hands like that in a long time. But honestly, edelman would be just as sexy in that spot"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I made a mistake on the colts' right tackle. They should be way lower on this list. The RT position cumulative grade isn't positive, it's actually -36. It wasn't brought forth to me until a few hours after I made the post. "

but seriously, thanks"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""its possible they go 1-4 but not likely.""

exactly my point. 

Still very possible, i understand you wanna be optimistic but most of your wrs have only done good with brady. Also, wilfork is old but still contributed a ton last season for you guys. Just because easiely was wanted, doesn't mean hell do good or stay healthy. Its a question mark when most of your DL are rookies"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Im so sick of the blind eye and excuses you guys keep making:


McNally forgot the restroom he used ""many times while taking the balls to the field""? not likely. ""

YES! i do believe brady remembers mcnally, seeing as mcnally is the person that handles the balls, and brady was a huge voice in making it so teams can use their own balls and prep them how they want. It doesn't matter how many people he meets, the person that handles his balls is someone he would remember. 


AND YES! Its conduct detrimental to not cooperate with the investigation. you guys want this to go to court so bad? ALL HIS TEXTS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE MAKING HIS LACK OF COOPERATION POINTLESS. 

What does it matter if mcnally had a nickname? SO you're assuming that when asked about mcnally they just said ""Do you know mcnally?"" or ""Do you know mcnally, the person that handles and prepares your game balls"" 

Literally every logical thing in the report you pats fans are just saying ""NOPE HES NOT SAYING THAT HE DID ANYTHING, WHO SAYS THESE SCIENTISTS ARENT BIAS LIKE TED WELLS LOL GOODELL PROBABLY SET THIS UP""

You aren't giving a proper rebuttal because you're regurgitating the same thing that are in the comments below my OP. and the same crap I've been hearing. I also said ""honestly nothing definitive"" at the begining of my post but everyone wants to still jump in and scream that theres nothing concrete. OBVIOUSLY NOTHING IS SAYING BRADY SPECIFICALLY DID THIS. Its hard to have more concrete facts when  brady refuses to cooperate fully. 

Also, mcnally isn't giving wells a follow up interview. why not? wells even said himself that he would fly to massachusetts any day or time, it didn't matter to him he just wanted the follow up interview. But there more lack of cooperation? 

There are so many things that are damning in here, and you guys dig for the smallest things that barely refute any actual points."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Way to continue the discussion by insulting me instead of giving me FACTS, go read the report. You must be really uninformed about the whole situation, your Homer is showing. No facts given just an insult. Gotcha. 

I have the citations if you'd like to check for yourself, then again you probably won't read it and pound your fists screaming brady is innocent"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jet great David Gerard? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I know I'm too hopeful here but tanny had a statistically better season what do you think his chances of being in the next 5-10 spots would be? Man I'm just dreaming too much arent i? :/
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Just like my girlfriend 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Brady takes this to court and he has to give up his phone records that he refused to give up. His legal team poked through his phone records and advised him to still not give it up. There could be incriminating evidence as well. 

Also him lying a few times after this whole thing came about will look horrible on him in a court of law. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"What? Even if he turns them in to be inspected? That's not cheating, they were inspected and not deflated/inflated after inspection. Completely different"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What do we call an even 1:1? Void? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Don't sleep on Olivier Vernon! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"DRAFT TOWN BABY

Ya idk either "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I went over it after someone pointed it out. I noticed, just messed up. Can't blame me after hundreds of inputs lol "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah thats what it says, thats what the rule says. Cant deny factual evidence"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's why all my relevant comments are extremely in the negatives right now? This is actually a joke
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah this is for last year. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why are these threads getting deleted? This is the 4th that I've seen and the others have been deleted. Really mods? Again? Is it just cause it's bill Simmons? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The mods were right to leave this in the megathread.

I can't even get a valid relevant comment without being downvoted. It's reserved for irrelevant comments guys. Not because someone disagrees with you. Some people think this is something good.

While there are guys who are commenting ""fuckin asshole"" are at the top there are people saying ""wow this should be interesting I like this"" are in the negatives. 

I'll just stick to my spreadsheets. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You're delusional, nothing will be changed "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Heard. Let's hope for a shoutout week 14 :)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think you mean 180, 369 would mean their secondary is where It started "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Also a weaker defense
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because when I don't have a Dolphins flair my opinion about the current situation wasn't downvoted 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Just let it go, i read this report from front to back with my own annotations in my notes, its extremely obvious when people, like this person you are responding to, haven't read anything except random quotes from other people in different threads. Its a lost cause trying to argue with some of these guys. Props to you for actually knowing what you're talking about"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah but he started most games at LG for us
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh what the fuck. If this is true, he is easily one of the biggest asshole dumbasses ever "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Didn't tre Jackson fail multiple physicals though?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Then read the report. Like I did. He quite literally lies to the NFL during an interview, if that doesn't make him look bad idk what does "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yup they'd be 2nd, just above the cowboys by less than a whole point. Mack graded out a +6.9 before his injury"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,His situation in at Louis is extremely close to what tannehill has. I'm really not sure where you're getting your facts. Mike Wallace doesn't make our offense much better. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I really hope so. He's such a beast. There's a reason Big Ben threw the ball to him over 170 times last season. Just fucking beast 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"His job should be able to punish him how they see fit. Wether or not it's fair, they themselves have found him breaking policy/rules. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm downvoting you because correcting someone's use of a word isn't adding to the discussion. Also complaining about downvoting. Now goodnight fella
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes they can suspend him. He works for them. THEY found he broke the rules. Nothing we say can fix that. So THEY can suspend or fine him if they want too. It sucks, but shit happens. It's his job and they can punish him how they see fit"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah he shouldn't have been at LT, Albert going down was bad for him. His rookie year, and he was never supposed to even sniff the position "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,THE PICK IS IN AND THE SHOE WILL DROP 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because I don't like to see my team fail. High draft pick doesn't always mean high play. Just a talented prospect that could still bust. And we are pretty damn close to the playoffs
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I know the bills got Rex, and the Falcons got Quinn, the jets got Bowles. I can't think of any others off  the top of my head"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Coke and sadness arent synonymous. So you lose that one. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Dolphins will win at least 8 and I'll take that bet. They have done absolutely nothing but improve. JARVIS was amazing last year I really don't know where you're getting your facts. 84 receptions 758 yds and 5tds is a damn good year for a rookie. Stills was the best deep receiver in the NFL last season. Train wreck is definitely nothing close to what we are and I question any knowledge you have about football just on what you're saying. I'll be excited to see the pats struggle with Jimmy g, and it's gonna be hilarious to see you guys all make excuses as to why your below average team without brady will fail after he leaves. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This has to be my favorite one
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh I was going off of what Yee said. He said that more probable than not, in legal terms meant at least 50.1% on the dan Patrick show"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yanda is not even human [Here is his game by game breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/6pR8eE6.png) including playoffs.

And for Monroe, he missed a few games last season so it hurt him a bit, but [Here](http://i.imgur.com/tWwzARe.png) is his game by game breakdown. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm excited. I can't wait to see him open up the 1v1 for Cam wake 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,GET UM BOYS
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He's alright, don't care much for him to be honest, but i don't hate him"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Best OL in the NFL before this signing isn't ""just ok"" though "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,/u/isreactionary_bot Dr_Irrelephant
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dolphins 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Usually most first time offenders get this option. I'm not sure about domestic violence, you'd probably know more than I do, but I know tons of people that have gone through this program. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I feel you. I wish there was a simpler way to put it. We should coin a new term 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Hey that kinda rhymed 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Dwayne Allen, coby fleener, andre Johnson, Frank gore, MATHIS, vontae Davis, and of course Boom Herron are not bad. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ameer Abdullah maybe?? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh you mean the season they literally had the easiest schedule of the decade and played against the worst division of the year? Yeah I remember that 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,IM CRYING PLEASE DONT GET LEO! PLEASE JETS ILL SAY GENO IS GOOD
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'll take the over. 9 games. More reasonably 8  though 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The draft is pretty much the biggest part of an offseason. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Someone Pm'd Me the grades, thanks again stranger! Ill report back when I'm finished guys!"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Dude I'm allowed to have my own opinion. You can too. Why I like tannehill and actually would put him up there. He's improved every season with the worst possible OL available to him. This past season he threw 4000+ yards 27tds and 12 ints. If you don't like him that's your opinion and I respect it. Why do people get salty when you have a differing opinion on things? You're like the 5-6th person to comment saying this. If you don't like it, then don't comment"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tannehill is actually a scrambling QB put into a different offense then he's used to. He's rushed for 700+ career rushing yards so far and 4tds  In 3 years. So I get RW has legs. But so does tanny. And if he was in the same offense as Russell he'd run quite a bit more
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Lol ok gotcha. Also, idk honestly, just a trial/change. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dolphins have a better offense then the bills. And the Bills have a better defense. Our DL is still pretty damn elite though. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I know I'm putting out a cumulative table tomorrow. It doesn't account for scheme or how fast the QB releases the ball. It's a bit tough to do so. This was meant more as an individual comparison and roughly adds up to the adjusted value of the OL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ha I lived in Monroeville! Do you know caseys pizza?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Eh, clabo isn't really good, we let him go after our 59 sack season in 2013. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I don't see it. But anything can happen I suppose 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Newhouse graded at overall -11.6. Run blocking: -3, Passblock: -8.5"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ask him if McNally is really a spazz
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's ok the pats got a 5th round LS 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Doubtful 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Probably being offered picks man! I'm hype too! Fuck! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nobody is giving 2 firsts for a 38 year old QB even if it is Tom Brady. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Cool man, I just don't care about the situation. If people ask me I just say no I don't think he cheated and move on. The discussion goes nowhere. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,WHY IS DUPREE FALLING SO FAR! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"This is last years lines, and I used who ever played the most snaps at the position. Which was ola"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Well that's the media for you. K
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jets fan would mess up the number. ITS 103 YA JABRONI. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Suhs contract seems pretty damn worth it considering how great our cap situation is over the next few years
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Soon my brother. THEN WE FLOURISH!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I mean tannehill did pretty damn good last year with a bad OL. 

4,059yds 27tds  11ints 66.4% completion percentage. And we had the 32nd ranked OL in the league the last few years"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's not even the same guy 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Shit I'm still salty about losing to you guys two years ago. That would've put us in the playoffs that year
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well if you don't mind, what was your username? I thought it was someone else but I searched his name and it's still active. No need to say if you don't want to.

Also you'd be surprised if the amount of Canadian pats fans on here. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"THats not true, the NFLPA didn't say anything to brady. 

""Per a source with knowledge of the situation, the NFLPA did not represent ir advise Brady in the Wells investigation, at the request of Brady and his representatives. It’s unclear why Brady didn’t want input or help from the union. It’s also unknown whether the NFLPA would have advised him to surrender his text messages and emails. Brady’s refusal to do so amounts to failure to cooperate with the investigation, which in turn automatically becomes conduct detrimental to the league.""



Source: [NBCSPORTS](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/07/nflpa-didnt-advise-or-represent-brady-in-wells-investigation/)"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Alright who let Stephen A. Smith in here?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Except brady is under investigation at his job, where its in his best interest to cooperate fully.
NSA is a completely different thing. Where everyone is being spied on whether guilty of anything or not"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's not the point. Downvotes are reserved for off topic comments. Not contributing opinions 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,-4.4
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"ill be posting WRs next, maybe tomorrow"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It doesn't seem to me that very many people have even read the report. So after reading i added my own annotations and am going to provide a few of my findings:

Honestly, there is nothing definitive in the entire report, but there are a lot of damning things in it. Most of the fact is refusal to cooperate, brady blatantly lying among other inconsistencies by patriots:


**PAGE 129:**
""Brady was likely to be (or become) familiar with the NFL rules regarding game balls, including the 12.5 psi minimum inflation level, although Brady denies having been aware of Rule 2 or the minimum inflation level until 2014 (despite approximately fourteen years as an NFL quarterback)""


**FOOTNOTE:** ""He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.""


**page 125**:
""When interviewed, McNally claimed, among other things, that he brings game balls to the field when he deems fit, that he generally does not receive permission from or inform the game officials before leaving the Officials Locker Room and taking game balls to the field and that he often has taken game balls into the tunnel bathroom near the entrance to the playing field. We do not find these claims plausible and they were contradicted by other evidence developed during the investigation.""


**ALSO**


**PAGE 59:**
""With respect to his decision to use the bathroom, McNally claimed that he has used the bathroom near the field entrance while in possession of the game balls many times. He said that on the day of the AFC Championship Game, he entered the bathroom, dropped the ball bags to his left, and used the urinal to his right. That bathroom, however, does not contain a urinal.""


**Conclusion**


as you can see, there are a ton of inconsistencies here."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's cumulative at the position. Not just your starter 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""He declared himself the one true Jedi"" lmfao wtf that's awesome "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm staying out of this thread from now on. You pats fans downvote anyone even when directly quoting shit from the report. Stay in denial. It won't change brady being suspended. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Guessing we trade back! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Fair, I feel our low could be 7-9 though, our division is getting harder and we tend to lose to teams that we should beat. But I love the optimism anyway "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Pushing it to say the DLine is good when Easley hasn't been healthy the last few years in his career and brown hasn't played a snap yet
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I'll take a look after im done with this chart 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I did it a few weeks ago. Just testing it out but I haven't been on a computer in a while and I can't change it back from my phone. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,NOT IN MY HOUSE
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh fuck off. Every game counts. 12-4 and if brady is suspended more than 2 games you guys aren't getting past 9-7 at best
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Wouldn't it be 3 in a row? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah it was pretty bad
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So why do the fans get to decide wether or not it should be a fine and not his job? They have rules and policies and can punish how they see fit. Whether you think it's fair or not
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Don't the pats always do better later in the season than in the beginning 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Raiders Cowboys and giants 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's amazing how I've gotten downvoted every time I've posted this, when its a direct citation from the report stating a fact that brady lied. But it's cool be in denial guys. 

I read the full report and made my own notes with cites for everything I found important. I know quite a bit about this report and it's very easy to see how little a lot of people know about this report and are just regurgitating the same crap they here in every thread without reading the report. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Seems like all of our front offices forget to do the OL :(

But:

LT: Albert, ferguson

LG: aboushi

C: mangold, Pouncey

RG: Wendell

RT: Vollemer, James 

EDIT: [I'm using my personal grading sheet for this](http://imgur.com/qmkXEQo) which i implemented PFF Grades and Grades as a unit as well "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Except in the words of Tom Brady's lawyer ""more probable than not in legal terms means 50.1%"" meaning the wells report believes there is at least that much of a chance of him knowing. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I think it was Mariota wouldn't be taken in the top 2 IIRC
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Do you not think we should? Lol he's played his ass off these last 3 years
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Relevant username
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Sweeeeet. See you around big guy 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dez bryant. Haven't seen anyone that passionate about the game in years
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No particular order:

Brady
Manning
Rodgers
Brees
Romo
Rivers
Ryan
Ben
Luck
Tannehill/stafford

"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Can we have a ban in the free talk friday threads on talking about the issues going on? It'd be nice to take a break and talk to all my boys in here
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I literally said in my OP ""there is nothing definitive"" 

But it hurts when you lie regardless of how big or small the lie is. Especially when the guy in question is the person under the microscope? The guy that refers to himself as the deflator? Questions needed answering. It just looks bad. Again, there is no definitive evidence and I didn't even say he cheated or anything. Just laying out facts. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Its easier with FA, but tougher with rookie OL because you never know how their going to do, you have no sample size to even estimate"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Regardless Id take staff over wilson. But I respect your opinion on that. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So lets just ignore:

""he did not know McNally‟s name or **anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities**""

he still lied. You guys are getting crazy about this when the facts are right in front of you"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah we're all terrible aren't we. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Are you just not going to address the secondary? or the big question mark at DL? 

The OL hasn't changed much, tre jackson failed multiple physicals before the draft, thats why he fell so far. And Jimmy G is unproven, going against one of the best Defenses in the NFL, and 2 of the best offenses. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If it's 6 games he comes back to play us, and I'd be excited for that "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We had so much hope. almost beat the broncos too smh
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He's known around the league as one of the most humble guys off the field, and one of the best work ethics people have ever seen "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"There's proof brady lied tho. I always get Downvoted for saying this but it's in the report that brady lied. That just looks really bad 

Edit: yup go ahead and downvote me. While you're at it go read page 129 of the wells report so you have proof that brady lied before acting like you did read the whole thing. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well yeah that could definitely help their case. But the margins are massive. They didn't pass much, and changed QB quite a bit. But D'Brickashaw, and especially nick mangold played phenomenally last season. Helped more than anything. Even if they passed a lot more, they'd still be very good compared to us. It also shows how bad Geno can be when he has that positive at least helping him. This season will be his real test. He has so many weapons now it's almost impossible for him to fail. If he does, Id bet the bank that GENO gets cut or traded.

To put it into perspective with 0 being average across the board. The jets avg. -0.46 as a unit. With the pats at -2.5, fins at -12.54 and bills at -12.6. Yeah the bills and fins OLs were very close. But still very terrible"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What first rounder? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Did you really just call him a pig?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Its clear homerism and crazy to say you would take an unproven QB(Hardest position to transition to) From a spread offense in college, over  Tannehill who is proven, coming off of a 4000 yard 27 td season. Also with a higher completion percentage and very similar stats to brady last season."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,To be fair if there was more cooperation the blanks would be filled pretty well 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And Miamis defense? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Super raw player for the pats. How's their OL coach?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It doesn't seem to me that very many people have even read the report. So after reading i added my own annotations and am going to provide a few of my findings:

Nothing definitive but There are a lot of damning things in it. Most of the fact is refusal to cooperate, brady blatantly lying among other inconsistencies by patriots:


**PAGE 131:**

""Based on the testing and analysis, however, Exponent concluded that, within the range of likely game conditions and circumstances studied, they could identify no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the Patriots halftime measurements or for the additional loss in air pressure exhibited by the Patriots game balls, as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the Colts game balls. Dr. Marlow agreed with this conclusion. This absence of a credible scientific explanation for the Patriots halftime measurements tends to support a finding that human intervention may account for the additional loss of pressure exhibited by the Patriots balls.""


**PAGE 130:**

""As discussed above, Brady‟s refusal to provide us with his own emails, text messages and phone records on relevant topics, in response to our narrowly tailored requests, limited the evidence available for our review and analysis. We believe that our findings are nevertheless supported by the evidence and information available to us during the course of our work.""

 

**PAGE 129:**

""The inflation level of game balls clearly is important to Brady as demonstrated by his reactions when he believed that game balls were inflated at an undesirable level. Brady personally was involved in the 2006 rule change that allowed each visiting team to supply its own game balls in accordance with the preferences of its quarterback, and it is reasonable to infer that during the process of advocating that rule change, Brady was likely to be (or become) familiar with the NFL rules regarding game balls, including the 12.5 psi minimum inflation level, although Brady denies having been aware of Rule 2 or the minimum inflation level until 2014 (despite approximately fourteen years as an NFL quarterback)""



**FOOTNOTE:** ""He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.""

We do not find these claims plausible and they were contradicted by other evidence developed during the investigation.""


**PAGE 106**

""Brady recalls requesting that Jastremski visit the “qb room” because he was busy preparing for the Super Bowl and wanted to discuss how the game balls would be prepared. He said that he “loved” the game balls Jastremski prepared for the AFC Championship Game""

**FOOTNOTE:**

""Jastremski acknowledged that in his twenty-year career with the Patriots he had never before met

with Brady in the “qb room,”""



**ALSO**


**PAGE 59:**
""With respect to his decision to use the bathroom, McNally claimed that he has used the bathroom near the field entrance while in possession of the game balls many times. He said that on the day of the AFC Championship Game, he entered the bathroom, dropped the ball bags to his left, and used the urinal to his right. That bathroom, however, does not contain a urinal.""


**PAGE 12**



""Based on a series of simulations, Exponent determined that the air pressure in thirteen footballs could be readily released using a needle in well under one minute and forty seconds.""


**Conclusion**


as you can see, there are a ton of inconsistencies and damning things here. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Now you're just being defensive and implying. Use facts to support your argument. You read the report you should know where to look right?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They signed Orlando Franklin so that would help A LOT
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"QB is by far one of the hardest positions to transition into the nfl. And I don't think that he can turn Jimmy into a starter on any team, personally. I know he's a great coach, but with QBs its different. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh hell yeah, Mack graded at +6.9 last season before being injured, which if consistent at JUST that, you guys would be 2nd best OL over the cowboys slightly"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Greg robinson was probably the most RAW OL player drafted in the last 3-4 years. He was never supposed to start on that line last year at all. The ceiling is high as hell though
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I thought they had their starters in for the first half? Maybe not, you'd know more than I would but that's what I'm remembering"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If a player gets like that with a coach, that's worse then with a player or barely even a ref."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Thanks brotha. I don't mind if you don't credit me, not a huge deal. I've actually been shown like 4-5 random forums across the web that it's been posted on. But i appreciate it i just wanna give people more to look at "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What QB had the balls deflated after the ref checked them besides brady? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Which manning? 

Edit: D is correct. The rest are wrong. Rodgers TD/int is 7.6 its crazy"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm watching this show right now, fuck yes"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Haha no problem. Keep an eye out tomorrow I should be releasing WRs. Also, the cumulative grades for each OL position. That should've been included here but it didn't cross my mind TIl it was too late"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"PAGE 129: 

He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials.

In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Or texts between brady and other members of the organization? Completely relevant in an investigation like this.  And no need to be rude about it. You're taking it too personally 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I used who ever played the most snaps at the position, if they didn't start the most. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,would you agree with that? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Please be orange, please be orange, please be orange!!"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Can't go wrong with D Smel 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Not in the last two years. I got way too bored way too fast. I rented it a few times 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Clueless? Lolol the pats are o lot better at the tight end position, the LB Position and the FS position. That's not enough To win without brady. So have fun with that one. The bills and fins and jets are all better all around teams outside of QB. Unless you wanna talk about Jimmy g is who is an unproven scrub, then you still lose in every position. Enjoy the losses without Brady :) "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Careful, even as a pats fan being logical, you'll get Downvoted into oblivion for saying brady could get suspended"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You are wrong. Pittsburgh doesn't suck. They're one of the best teams in the AFC
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Gregory was a top 10 prospect before some unknown info was revealed to certain teams. He's the best by far
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You're honesty the first pats fan I've heard say this. I think it could go either way. Coaching is great, but on paper, without brady, I see them as a 6 win team. But you never know with the pats. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Honestly, there is nothing definitive in the entire report, but there are  a lot of damning things in it. Most of the fact is refusal to cooperate, brady blatantly lying among other inconsistencies:

**PAGE 129**:

 ""Brady was likely to be (or become) familiar with the NFL rules regarding game balls, including the 12.5 psi minimum inflation level, although Brady denies having been aware of Rule 2 or the minimum inflation level until 2014 (despite approximately fourteen years as an NFL quarterback)""

**FOOTNOTE:**  ""He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.""


**page 125:**

""When interviewed, McNally claimed, among other things, that he brings game balls to the field when he deems fit, that he generally does not receive permission from or inform the game officials before leaving the Officials Locker Room and taking game balls to the field and that he often has taken game balls into the tunnel bathroom near the entrance to the playing field. We do not find these claims plausible and they were contradicted by other evidence developed during the investigation.""

**ALSO**

**PAGE 59:**

""With respect to his decision to use the bathroom, McNally claimed that he has used the bathroom near the field entrance while in possession of the game balls many times. He said that on the day of the AFC Championship Game, he entered the bathroom, dropped the ball bags to his left, and used the urinal to his right. That bathroom, however, does not contain a urinal.""

**Conclusion** 

as you can see, there are a ton of inconsistencies here. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I mean we're only really missing an OG and LB at this point. Everything else seems pretty damn solid if you ask me 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They went 12-4 last season. Every team in our division has gotten better. If the pats lose brady for even 4 games I see them maybe hitting a wildcard 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ah ok thanks for not being a prick about it. I retract my statement. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dare I say...jets fans??
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I have about 10 relevant comments in here all of them are downvoted to hell. I hate complaining about downvotes but this is ridiculous and I'm disappointed. I need a break from this sub. Don't think I'm gonna be posting those PFF grade sheets for a few days.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Soliai is a beast. Idk what you're talking about 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"But it says in the report that he personally told tom his game day duties, and jastremski also said he knew mcnally:

He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference."""
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah same here. We had Pouncey come off injury and move to guard (fuckin shit) Albert got injured so we had to start our rookie RT at LT. And...ugh dallas Thomas 😒. And satele. God dammit why did I do this to myself
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Get ready for salty fans telling you why the Dolphins won't do good.  
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man I'm seeing so many people post my spreadsheet! Hah! Woop!!!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Ohrnberger: 453 snaps

Watt: 331 snaps"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Idk about th secondary? I mean you guys don't even know who is starting at your CB spots. Mccourty is the only viable one. Good LBs but an unproven DL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ah my bad I misread. Sorry long night last night 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Pizza bets are awesome. Find me if you remember when the season starts I'll be down for that. It makes fantasy football so much more fun for me, why not add it to reddit too? :D"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lol close one 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh shit didn't know that,  good for him. Glad he's healing properly "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,OH IS IT GETTING OLD HAVING THE SAME PERSON IN THE CONFERENCE FINALS EVERY YEAR?! PLEASE TELL ME OF YOUR PAIN 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man I'm nervous! Anyone think we take Dupree if he falls to us? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You'd switch with the pats. And your OL will have some huge competition 6 times a year with all the monster DLs
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He grew up playing soccer and told coach, so he said fuck it why not. Literally Suhs mom wouldn't let him play football Til late highschool cause she thought it was dangerous"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Well I know who doesn't have the best guards :(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"actually picks can't be appealed. And trust me i read this thing front to back and posted all my annotations and direct quotes with citations showing all the damning proof and i get down voted into oblivion because /r/patriots2 is in full effect. i don't care anymore, wasted my time reading it because every pats fan is going to argue into the ground with delusion and stupid retorts like ""NO EVIDENCE LOL EVERYONE HATES US""  about all of it. Im Done have a good night.  "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm guessing trae Waynes here 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What about buqs?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We gotta be reading back no way we take this long to pick! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They did check the balls. This is because they were altered after they were inspected 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No it's not. This is relevant to the NFL. A first round pick last year that was injured for the most part is going to be healthy enough to start the season. Next you'll be saying Clowney ready to play shouldn't be here either 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I've literally read the entire report and have my own notes on them. Citations and all. Unlike most of this sub that actually is regurgitating 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Big Bens Completion Percentage is 67.1% 8.2 Y/A , 3.6 TD/int"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,lol do they rank you guys higher? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm sayin... :( it hurts to look at all that green in the NFCN 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,SONGATE
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damn I don't wish John jerry at guard for anyone. Sorry bud
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What lol 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hey man that's your opinion, and I respect it. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Alex mack graded at a +6.9 before his injury too
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""One schrute buck is 1/1000 of a dollar.""

"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'll give it a shot 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,In a court of law all necessary evidence needed will be asked for. A subpoena will be issued. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah those were accounted for. A cumulative table is coming tomorrow. 

Also the pats won with a bad OL because brady gets rid of the ball very fast. So it helps a lot"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If my boss said I can sit there and only show him what I needed to show him for the sake of investigation and I had absolutely nothing to hide, fuck yeah I would. Why the hell wouldn't i? I did nothing wrong right? I'm allowed to show you ONLY what you wanted me to show you and not give you my phone for an entire day for you to scan through every crevice of info? Then yes"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tsuhnami and earthwake incoming! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If he did In fact say that, he's a moron. Jesus that has to be top 5 dumbest thing a person could say "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah that's what I was thinking. Hopefully I'll start that tonight. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,If he has a career year I definitely see it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I'm tired of hearing how stupid it was. It's still an issue. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Man I love eddie Lacy, he makes me love watching running backs again. He just runs through defenders and keeps on truckin "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No problem. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,WINSTON! IM NOT SURPRISED BUT GOD DAMN I LOVE BEING THIS HYPE! SOMEONE HUG ME
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh I completely understand. And If my team had wilson I would still be happy as shit. Just personal opinion 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,SORRY CHIP I DIDNT MEAN IT
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's also quite literally in the report that brady lied.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nah 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,http://imgur.com/7Z3g6C7
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"thanks, but don't forget a lot of OLineman have been traded/moved to different teams"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"When your team has no QB and hasn't made the playoffs in over 15 years, you should be worried. Once we shore up the OL, we'll be fine. And our secondary was good last year before the injuries. Also, an elite DT does help the secondary. Giving cameron wake and Olivier Vernon a 1 on 1 matchup 90 percent of the time will make QBs have less time to throw the ball. Oh yeah, and I don't blame us not finishing over .500 on tanny, it's a team sport, and tanny over achieved last season. And our run game isn't underwhelming. Lamar miller had a 5.1 YPC last year. And Damian williams was a boss as well. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"haha that'd be sweet, but i doubt this would make espn, its mostly PFF Grades and i think they have better ways of grading than i do. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I can see where there are holes. But didn't brady also say after the AFCCG that he didn't even know the guy? When he was giving him signed shit up from last offseason? It sucks it really does and if brady had nothing to do with this or no knowledge then I feel bad. But in my head there isn't much of a scope for cheating. If you did it you did it. Not exactly suspension worthy that's for sure, but something.  "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Good thing we have a top DL, but then again...Dolphins :("
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Only pats fans are hyping him up, like they do with every back up QB Yall get. And yeah with the current players our teams have that's what we were last year. Suh is the best DT in the NFL, anything could happen, but there's no way he doesn't at least keep us at top 10. The jets kept their defense the same, but added Revis and cromartie. 2 guys that have flourished on that same defense in the past. The bills have a monster DL and a damm good secondary. We're talking defense now. And there's no way all 3 aren't top 10 again "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck! The pick is in! No trade :/
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"31 teams and you pick miami? Lol and who else did we lose? We lost wallace who was abysmal, hartline who is declining, and Clay but who isn't effective in our new system. That's it. Are you forgetting landry? Had a great season, we don't need to upgrade at Rb lamar is good enough and we did add Ajayi. Also, your team won the super bowl but lost literally all your CBs that make a difference. Your DLine is underwhelming, lbs are good but injury prone. Unproven backup QB, ok RBs. And no good receiving threats besides Gronk. Edelman is good but there's no reason to believe he isn't a product of brady. Also, brady has an extremely fast release which made your bad Ol look better even though they were still ranked in the bottom 3rd of the NFL. Sure, good coaching staff, but philbin isn't the only person we have lol coyle is a top DC and Lazor has shown how much he improved our offense. Add in that we have a proven backup QB, we definitely don't finish last in the NFL. Especially if we aren't even comparing just our division but you think they'll finish last in the NFL? Cmon dude, there are tons of worse teams in the NFL that if they lost their QB they'd be so much worse than both our teams. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I actually wanted to try something like this before. But I couldn't get the courage to do it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damm you just compared cutler to geno. SAVAGE
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah I'm with you on that. Something shady was going on, after reading the report, it was pretty easy to see that he did lie about a few things that shouldn't have been lied about:

PAGE 129 of the wells report:

""He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference."" "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Thats a good idea i might release the cumulative when i put out the WRs, since this is underway already and I'm tired"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes thats what he said, but this guy i replied to said ""There is no evidence of direct communication between brady and mcnally"" , to where i disproved him, using direct evidence "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tate is tied for most avoided/broken tackled by a wr this season with steve smith at 20 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If it's not licensed I won't buy it. takes a lot out of te game when you have no real team names, or players.  I might just wait and see how it is first "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Mostly the second thing, but not entirely. Im still a fin fan til i die though. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,DA FUCK?! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Sounds to me like she was covering up for him so he wouldnt get in trouble again. A little kid isn't going to lie about a guy beating his sister. A girl will, whether she's scared or loves him, it happens often. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm honestly sick of this response. Yes i do think brady would remember the guy that handles the balls, and inflates them to his preferences. Its perfectly plausible. Im also sick of people saying ""LOL i see the janitor at work but i don't know him LOL"". i get it, you guys want to have a lot of doubts, but some of these responses are ridiculous "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah only because he didn't play until a few weeks in. He was still recovering from offseason hip surgery. And at that point idk whose dumb idea it was to put Pouncey at guard instead of center. He hasn't played guard since college 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He was talking to just about every team, I'm assuming that's why, and also no they'd still owe him the guaranteed money. So it seems like a waste even if it is a small price"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No it's just a stupid name.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I always get shit for this but I would take 10 QBs over wilson. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I honestly now think that patriots fans need only video footage to believe anything. Nothing is good enough evidence to you. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Most of our defenses have been top 5-10 for the last few years. We've just all bolstered  them up. So we know the floor for jets and bills are top 5 and for miami top 10. Our defense weren't that good when brady went down.

And speaking of havent seeing people play, Jimmy g has barely thrown the damn ball and every pats fan is ready to throw him at the helm. It's just funny to me"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He just signed his new contract why would he be this upset already? I don't get it 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The madden curse...noooooooooo
BAH_GAWD_KING_,ಠ_ಠ
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Careful you might get a hate message or Two like I did when I did the PFF thing. 

Some people think it's fucked up to release paid content. Good job man"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah man i hate john jerry, I can't believe he started on another team after he left us. Hope y'all get better"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's what I said? I said the steelers and Cowboys have that one. Meaning the steelers and Cowboys have the most. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Care to take on another person for this bet? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"But like what about, idk, just a random number off the top of my head but 17? *crosses fingers*"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Man I just did, and it's not even fair. But the Giants and skins weigh the division down, the AFCN is nuts, green across the board.

I'll be posting all these tomorrow "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Holy shit I didn't realize it was the same guy til you pointed it out.  
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Because players don't generally play every snap, they are rotated quite often. Especially when on the field for long periods of time"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So has Mark Sanchez and Tim tebow 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lol what? I never said that. I'm saying it shows that he's had serious injury. That's why I asked. If tre Jackson failed physicals then he has high chance of injury is all I was saying. Not that they shouldn't have taken him. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He doesn't control how 53 guys think.
Some people like to win "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Agreed 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Philipe rios!?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You're my best thread too!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is for 2014 thats why
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I honestly am confused. I think I've maybe watched like one or two college football games in my life. Maybe someone with a similar name? Mind linking the thread? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"lmao! Its all good, its funny because the only other person to say something or misread it was a bengals fan earlier asking about zeitler hahahah thats awesome. But yeah he did pretty sweet last season. But Have a  good night man "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He's 100% a top 10 QB 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Not really, again if nobody else can use these texts out of context, then yall shouldn't be able to either. And sorry not to sound like a dick, but that's a really sorry interpretation of deflate. Especially seeing how he said something about going to espn, and also other texts about deflating where he talked about inflating as well "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,In the end none of this matters because brady will still be suspended. Maybe reduced but it stands. Also the picks can't be appealed. All this saltiness from fans is for no reason for the most part
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Rodgers fake spike last season to beat us with like 10 seconds left in the game. Stupid sexy rodgers
BAH_GAWD_KING_,THATS NOT FAIR FUCK YALL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Did you really comment this in two different threads? Like, literally the same exact thing? Again, quit the victim complex. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah but I called dibs
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"To be fair to you, you're not wrong. Everyone in this sub overrates their team. Every offseason in a ""predict your record"" thread there's a ton of fans screaming out ""10-6 we improved everywhere! Can't see is doing worse than 8-8!"" "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Sorry but i believe the scientists wells used rather than you who doesn't know all the facts 

Edit: downvote me all you want, brady is still suspended, and ill believe a scientist over some reddit user copy and pasting bull crap, any day of the week"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He had a pretty damn good season last year. 

4,762yds 40 TDs 16 ints 60.1% completion percentage 7.7 Y/A"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because he's proven he can be very solid at the position. It's not like injury held him back. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I never complain about downvotes. It's stupid. But when we try and have a discussion like this it gets frustrating.

The last 5 minutes I've simply asked questions and have gotten downvoted. There is seriously no way people are saying this isn't because of flair. Or not agreeing with views. There's a guy saying he likes Goodell hearing the appeal in the negatives while another guy with a pats flair saying """"fuckin asshole"" or something of that sort, is getting upvoted. And people say it's because it's off topic. I just want this to be over only because I'm sick of not being able to have my own opinion in this sub. I don't give a fuck if they just let brady play and give back the pick. I just want it to be back to normal "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Last year Dolphins against the packers. I wasn't even mad. Intense from beginning to end
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Guessing you just googled these then. And no i wasn't rounding this is what was listed.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lol and you're the only person I this sub that says this. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So you suspect the refs of inflating them? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Idk about best ever. He's athletic as fuck but he doesn't even play football. Who's to say he could block, or take a big hit? How do we know how his hands are? He wouldn't be the best ever"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I only Downvoted his second comment where he was being an ass to be honest and I believe that's why he was by others 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Get this shit out of this sub. Go back to /r/seahawks 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That sounds pretty boring 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The Suh thing is different, an elite player in his prime will play at a high level anywhere. But i agree, good set of LBs. Also can't count out D-mac"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"That's preparing the footballs, like before the game. The refs still used to hand the balls to the ball boy"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Honestly if I was brady I would've at least came out and said ""I never cheated, nor do I consider myself a cheater"" at least show some confidence about it. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He just plows through defenders it's crazy 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Probably not though since his account is less than a day old :p 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Man I gotta give a lot of credit to bill Lazor. He was QB coach for the Eagles when nick Foles had his crazy season, brought that offense to miami and has definitely helped tanny. But I don't hate on philbin as much as a lot of people do. Philbins worst flaw is his time management in game. As you can clearly see during our packers game early in the season "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I'm going to release a cumulative grade for each team tomorrow when i release the wrs grades. These are just the guys that played the most starts/snaps
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"We signed Brandon Albert, drafted Ju'Wuan James and extended pouncey. That's not nothing "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Barnes played more snaps at RT
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Kouandjo! kouandjo!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Id put Reshad jones over Pryor. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You should probably start remembering how shitty the pats were before brady and get used to it
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh god brady to landry would be deadly 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You didn't prove anyone wrong.  DGBs case is closed. Clarks isn't. Nobody would talk much about it like Clark on that alone
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Except this isn't the police. And if you truly have nothing to hide then giving them your phone wouldn't hurt anything. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It was a joke. It's not an excuse. What, just because they're the patriots they'll always have a good QB? Lmao get over yourself. You keep name calling without explaining how they'll be good. Classic know nothing fan. Come back when you actually have facts "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You forgot Brees in that list but yeah pretty much 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup! It was a great game 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The only real damning thing from that audio was the specific talk about getting crabtree's ACL. There's no other context for saying that imo. Everything else seemed pretty normal 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jarvis Landry. He was such a beast last year I can't wait to see what he can do 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Wait so you can AND can't determine the tone? If you can't determine the tones in the text message then you have no idea if it was a joke or not? What about the fact that Tom supposedly never talked to jastremski? But then there's literally back to back phone calls after the AFCCG between them. And brady called him into his QB room when he said nobody ever goes in there or gets invited in? And this is after they are informed of an investigation. So what, now they're talking to eachother? NOW he invites someone in? And besides the fact that brady said told jastremski that he ""loves the balls prepared for the affccg"" so he loved how they were under regulation? Please go read the report before you get schooled. I got a notepad full of notes from actually reading this report"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Well I read the report and think the punishment is fair. Read it front to back. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,My grandpa(RIP) used to do this in his basement. He's old school AF. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Let's not get carried away here 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Wells only interviewed him one time. NFL security interviewed him 3. So its only logical that wells would want a  follow up interview
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We've only had Lazor for a year and he's amazing. Thanks Eagles!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"And still nobody cares, not everything is about the patriots, yall always try to make a thread about them. Oh and it wasn't funny "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah but that was fun cause you could make crazy plays happen consistently imo. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah this one is the best imo. Calvin is a monster and the best WR in the NFL, and golden is just a younger steve smith 

Edit: younger "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Notice how the top comments  in the thread are praising him? Lol I don't buy it
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's not
Mostly luck based. A lot guys are just more durable. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes he was, I see him on the rise honestly.  "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,2nd highest rated safety last year according to PFF. Or are you just used to being a douchebag? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Heath Evans is so annoying. He looks angry as hell and all his answers are ""my friend wouldn't do this blah blah blah"" 


Lol get this guy off the air"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Idk I think it's nice to see how good or bad our OLs were last year. I searched for it before I started and there are no grades. Also it very tough to give a rookie who hasn't played a snap a grade. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You mean when his employer said he can go through his lawyer and give him only what was relevant to the investigation? Like texts with Jastremski and McNally? 

They aren't literally going to have his phone and go through pictures and irrelevant texts "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm sure they didn't take it very seriously until it was brought up again in the AFCCG. And now all of the sudden when brady says ""probably more often then not"" it means that it happened? You can make a case for both but it seems like he's just doing due diligence and covering his ass"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I honestly just hope we don't have to wait a few months to hear what happens. The circle jerking in this sub is about to be over 9000 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He didn't issue the punishment to brady though, he is considered neutral. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So underwhelming receivers? You already have that. Deion, OchoCinco and carter are better than what YALL have now. And this probably the worst defense the pats have had in over a decade. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yes because my team didn't dominate yours week 1 last season I forgot 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah lol but not induvidual WRS, more of WRS as a corps"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You're right I just checked, my bad"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,:(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No the odds of succeeding are low. Or else the Browns and bills collectively would've drafted 30 QBs who succeeded. It's the hardest position to succeed in. I don't justify sitting behind brady and having bb as a coach as being good. Or else, rivers, manning, Brees and all of Brady's backups would be starters right now. But they aren't. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,To remember the good old days when Yall had a QB?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You guys went through 4 centers, and the center I used played more snaps

http://imgur.com/zlQHAL4"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Both, but I'm going to make another one just for us, because we had so many guys switch to positions they weren't ready to play. Ex: pouncey, thomas, james"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nope. You're generalizing fan bases. I don't think he cheated.   
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"After grading the fins and bills, i was almost certain no team would be worse. And the funniest part is i graded the rams last, so i was like ""oh of course i had to wait this long to find someone worse than us"" "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,There are like 25 off topic comments that are among the top ones already. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"That's your opinion man, I say let's wait and see I'm tired of not being able to have my own on this topic. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They won't be available til July 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Very true
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Seriously dude. Read the report. Page 129, it shows that he lied about knowing McNally or even his game day duties. Then in an interview with McNally AND Jastremski they both said that McNally personally told TOM his game day duties and jastremski said that TOM did know him. 

So you were saying? I know you didn't read the report now so whatever you say is pretty much invalid "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,CALVIN JOHNSON 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Then don't come back to the sub. We already have enough negative people complaining all the time. 

Also, 2 of the top answers are packer and steelers fan saying their team will regress. So you're wring"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Isn't wilson the same height as Brees? Id take him over wilson 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He's fucking gorgeous 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Honestly the cap hit is huge but it won't put us in cap hell. His biggest hit is next season and that's when we were set to have 75 mil in cap space. Then we freed up 30 mil trading wallace and Ellerbe. It's not as bad as people make it seem. His 60 mil Gtd will be fully paid off in 3 years. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"lmfao!!! Wrs?? hahahaha You guys don't have anyone worth a damn besides Edelman and he's a slot wr at best. 
and no hahahahah Mike Pouncey is a top 5 Center you fucking bafoon.
Branden albert is also a top 5 LT, you fucking retard. You guys have better guards but thats it for OL. Linebackers sure, but not WR. QB, LB and TE are all you have on us you ignorant bitch. 

and good thing tannehill hasnt had a bad season yet! keep dreaming on that one

and Maybe you were 5 years old when you became a fan of the pats, but they were complete ass before brady. And if ""glass knee/back/elbow"" ground even stay healthy another 2 years you'll be lucky. Fuck off you know nothing retard"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah but don't expect this to get any attention. Everyone here is up voting the ""this is stupid and shouldn't be a big deal"" comments"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah, less than two games "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's hilarious how salty all of you are. All of the sudden you guys are master lawyers. When in fact 90 percent of you haven't even read the whole damn thing. Stop being butthurt. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I guess we beat you guys last season with a pretty meh team then huh?  
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's not 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He does this every year and comes back even better and stronger than the year before. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"This whole thing wouldn't have been as harsh if brady just gave up the phone records. Taking it to court will make him give those up. He literally cost himself all the stress and time when it's inevitable. He could've shown the NFL the records, and if he still didn't like his punishment post appeal he could've taken it to court. It's literally going full circle. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I watched his E:60, apparently they used him because he grew up playing soccer. His mom wouldn't let him play football because it was too dangerous"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""....McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference."""
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I think it's trying to tell us something guys
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well fuck, I'm irrelevant :("
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah kinda like tim Duncan. The guy will win his 7th nba ring and have a straight face on. Maybe a slight smile, robotic tone, seems genuinely boring "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Carr needs some weapons! Can't blame em!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah and he's 33 :( not much time for the guy 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If he's always obnoxious, the mods most likely delete them "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"There were 11 and all of them were under the limit.

Edit: uh am i the only one that read the report? This is exactly the truth. And I'm getting downvoted. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So because a cigarette company hired a CORPORATE LAWYER, to defend them those lawyers aren't supposed to do their job? Sorry but any firm would gladly take a multi billion dollar case. 

And not just that, but the NFL has basically said that it's done, seeing as what was said in the wells report. literally nothing anyone says can change it. Just wait for the punishment. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"God this is getting ridiculous with you guys. We get it. You guys are better lawyers and investigators than the NFL and Ted wells. It's insane how mad you all are about this when 90 percent of you haven't even read the damn report. Fuck, this sub will be in the shit hole if brady gets suspended"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Lmao nobody is mad, you're in denial. I'm sure you'll get far socially with that victim complex though 😉"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,NOOOOOO!!!!!!!! GOD NO PLEASE FUCK NO FUCK FUCK FUCK! GOD FUCKING SHIT FUCKING JETS FUCK YALL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Better than Chillie poon?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Doesn't sound like you know what you're talking about. Nobody can notice that within inches going that fast and stop or change direction like that. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yo make a Larry csonka one for me, that'd be dope "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And goaty McGoat brady didn't know about 75 year old rule? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I played destiny non stop until like 2-3 months ago. I got super bored when I basically got every exotic in the game. Hope this DLC is good enough to bring me back in 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well every pats fan wants them to take this to court where he WILL HAVE TO give up his phone. and the facts about that are:

Wells told brady he only wanted a few what was necessary and he could even give him this information THROUGH HIS LAWYER. 

again I'm not saying brady did it, it just looks really bad. I understand, being a pats fan you are going to have your doubts, but looking at it from an unbiased view, its more damning than helpful, ya know? "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I also graded the unit as a whole together, Used PFF as a base, and used players that started the most games at that position. as you can see Pouncey isn't at center. 

EDIT: i can do this for any other divisions if you guys would like. Or positional groups (Although defense is harder to compare because of the 3-4, 4-3 differences) "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I believe he has til the 14th
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Thanks :D i worked kinda hard on this its awesome to see the appreciation
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"An appeal and in court are two different things. He'd appeal in front of the NFL, court would be against the NFL "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,GREGORYYYYYY NOOOOOOOO. I wanted him man. But shit Cowboys building a team 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Brady gets the ball off pretty fast so he doesn't exactly need an elite OL. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I just finished doing the AFCS seems like it lol 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"That's what I said, but it still stands that you can't compare two different infractions."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why are you in every thread being a dingleberry 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,yup!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I don't believe that at all. But my relevant opinion will get buried like the rest. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""I'm sorry teacher I was only cheating a little bit"" 

I'm sure she'd let you go because it was one question out of 100? Or if you get pulled over going 1 mile over? It's bullshit but it's still against the rules. People can call it stupid all they want but cheating is cheating"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,ah ok thanks
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man atleast Yall have been to the playoffs consistently :/
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damn I was just working on these. Good job. I'm still going to release them with more stats and grades for other things as well. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Well you said it could get ugly so surely you have some idea of what they could be hiding? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lmao rebel
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You named bad players not a 100 million dollar loser on a pointless franchise 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's cause we know the reasons why teams in our division do the way they do. The jets are underrated for sure. This is the first time in forever though, that for the life of me, I have no idea what the division ranking will be at the end of the season. It could go to anyone "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Those positions are still kinda holes Til the players prove themselves 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Mammal. Dolphin=/=fish 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He traded a fucking empty keg and Budweiser sign for a snowmobile.....
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Play TOM for another year or two then unleash Jimmy after brady is too old to start. Trade TOM for a 3-4th rounder at that point. Profit
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You're right I went over it. I must've added when I needed to subtract. Or Accidently left out a negative and when I clicked the sum function it happened. I work on these pretty late and as you can imagine after hundreds of inputs I could make a mistake. Thanks for binging it up though 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I don't think wake will make the HOF. He has played at a high level the last few years, but he spent some time in the cfl. He's 33 and needs to accomplish much more. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Who the hell are you a fan of? Enlighten me
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Take off the homer glasses bud, they have a good DL but not the best in history "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah that's why I said it isn't the end all be all. But I appreciate the post and understand it
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He was on the fins last offseason but after that I don't remember where he went
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Or bills? Do people forget the bills are in New York? Lol 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nice joke Albert haynesworth 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I didn't include those because its all people talk about. These listed in my OP are things i almost never hear anyone talk about or address
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Very very true. Fuck all the Tom Brady one of the GOAT QBs. Nothing in his career is tarnished imo, people can be salty all they want. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"well it was 4 centers through the year, but yeah i mean it wouldn't help much tbh, you guys would at center would be  -27.9, it wouldn't make too much a difference in this case"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's a mistake I think. Lots of players don't like to be tagged 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You're still comparing two very different infractions. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This was supposed to be 2014 not 2015. As you can see Max Unger is still on the seahawks
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And a linebacker!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Fitzpatrick hurt with his broken leg still? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Colon had more snaps at RG
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Eagles have a higher rates run block than the Cowboys, I saw your /s but still wanted to make that clear "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i know what you mean, so happy all the bully crap died down as well. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah brady is going to go to court against a multibillion dollar organization because they found he went against the rules. Doubt he'd win, NFL is allowed to have its policies "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Good LBs, Jones is ok, everyone else s a question mark. especially, like i said, easley has had tons of injury issues, sheard hasn't played a snap with the pats yet, and neither has brown. id call it average"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,DGB??!? OH LAWWWWDDD
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because we don't need to agree with eachother. That doesn't make me irrational 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Homes graded at a -4.6 at center last year. so do with that what you will 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lions
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He won't evolve
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Come on day 2! Hope we grab marpet!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,THE 4th MANNING BROTHER 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dorito dink is an obvious insult. You're taking something out of context while simultaneously telling people not to take the texts out of context. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He isn't even the one that issued the punishment. He just authorized it. It happens in almost every punishment that gets dealt. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes, let's anger the man that's deciding our punishment.  "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Not if our run defense has anything to say about it! Hah! See Ya then
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Thanks ;)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I bought a Xbox one not too long ago so I don't find it reasonable to spend any more money on another computer for gaming. When I already have one I work on. It's just lots of money right now 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lauren tannehill doe 😁
BAH_GAWD_KING_,WOW!!! Surprising!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,How smart is this when you just signed Byron bell at Tackle? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well we don't have a 3rd. So I feel no need to watch anymore, but I can't stop "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Except if you read the report literally within the first 7 pages it shows that all 11 balls were under 12.5 psi
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think that mostly has to do with brady lying and it making it look bad on him. Like its very improbable he did anything and even if he did it wouldn't warrant a severe punishment but he lied regardless.


He said he didn't know his name or game day responsibilities which was wrong:

PAGE 129:

He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.

 "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Long snappers aren't really that hard to come by. I get he's good, but the 5th? "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,If he worked on it so long he would have some evidence. Which he doesn't. It's non existent
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I think it's ridiculous to assume that a full roster would cooperate with that. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm working on every division right now. Closing in on the AFC bout to move onto the NFC

Edit: now only the NFCW and NFCS left and I'm done. Gonna finish up in the morning and post it tomorrow afternoon "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Please take Malcolm brown bengals! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yall are the best, pack are the close second "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No I didn't. I brought up stuff that's barely or has never been talked about. Not information that's been beaten to death 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It doesn't take into account stuff like playing ridiculous defenses 6 times a year, or how fast the qb gets rid of the ball. its not entirely accurate but its something nice to look at of individual starters at least"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,yes but your offense AND front 7 were much better.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Isn't devante Parker tall? Hopefully he fills that void. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yaaayynooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,[...](http://imgur.com/4wHbP3e)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Idk why you guys want him he's not good 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He failed tons of physicals tho. Id be so upset honestly 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I guess I explained wrong. I went by most snaps played for the season at that position 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But it'll be better suited there where people care about it and it wouldn't get deleted
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Theres only hype behind him because a huge majority of this sub is patriots fans. And sorry but preseason means almost nothing, also Jimmy came from a spread offense in college, one of the most difficult to transition to when coming to the NFL because its pretty much non existent and shows nothing when comparing to a pro style offense "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And 2 dolphins! Yay us!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,haha your line is ass? BRUH -62! :(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Indeed, id give my left nut to have that man play guard for my team "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"PFF had us ranked the worst, but after my grades it shows the bills just slightly worse than us, you may be right but ill definitely do it for you guys. Im actually enjoying it"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I've seen like 10 people say an intern so I was seriously asking if it was an intern. That's why I said ""serious question"" but i guess you're too sensitive to handle a simple question "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Wait....I think I know what your old username was. COULD IT BE??!! FN???
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup with the Texans 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I wouldn't say detroit is tied for second here that's crazy. Ok detroit isn't that good on defense guys. Can we stop exaggerating here? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm so excited for him. definitely one of
My new favorite players"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,40 years of failure? Oh you mean having one of the GOAT QBs play and constant winning seasons? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Revis, Browner, dennard, arrington"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Correct on A and D!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lmao 1st and pimp
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So they didn't read the rule that was being changed? Just google rule 2 NFL. It's the first link. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Mega-watt? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I saw a bear once. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah seriously, and this isn't even the worst OL we've had in the last 3 years. in 2013 he was sacked 59 times. good lord am i happy he's durable"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Hahahah this is awesome. I'm going to use this all the time now thanks 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Here here, love me a top WR in the draft! "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I doubt it'll be that hard to find a better matchup than steelers v Pats. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Not all or many court trials get ugly. The only thing I can think of that will get ugly is Goodell and krafts friendship 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So..a little fat dick? Like a chode? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Why can't weeee be friends, why can't weeee bee frieeeends"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Don't really need to be subbed to post it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD682](http://imgur.com/tTHDqpD)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"And suspended the brady for longer. 4 games against teams that actually could beat them, except the jags(sorry guys)? If it were 6? That would be crippling for the team for sure "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I honestly would love for us to get a good healthy OL for him. He's improved every year, with the 30th, 32nd and 32nd worst OLs respectively in each of his seasons. I just hope his 4k+ yards 27tds and 12 ints last season wasn't his ceiling. Im assuming if Brandon Albert is healthy and we have Pouncey back at center instead of guard(why the fuck would we do this last season) and not force our rookie RT into LT for half the games last season we would improve this season again. But our glaring turnstile of a guard dallas Thomas won't help that one bit. Especially with the DLs in the AFC east"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh I know you weren't criticizing it, just thought you assumed it was updated, have gotten tons of those comments alread "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,i believe they only have like 2 of those guys on their line next season 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No because a gif Is a file format. So by saying JPEG in this comment, you're contradicting the gif portion of the comment. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I didn't know what a high grade was until I saw marshal yanda's Holy hell 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well it's 2, up until this offseason "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man I love Dez so much. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Anyone else to argue with his OC like that he would've been benched. Nothing great about that. Just whining 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He's been suspended once in 5 years. So Id take 2 to 1 on not at all 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"**PAGE 12**


""Based on a series of simulations, Exponent determined that the air pressure in thirteen footballs could be readily released using a needle in well under one minute and forty seconds.""


**EDIT**:

also judging by your recent comment history, looks like you are a pats fan.

and i absolutely went into this with an unbiased state of mind I'm just sick of the brigading by every pats fan. can't point out facts without getting down voted. The top 15 comments in this thread are ""fuck goodell"" and other pats fans saying ""TOO HARSH OMG"""
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Graham is rated at -0.2 in Pass Blocking and +3.1 in Run blocking.

Unger is -0.7 in pass blocking and +14.0 in Run Blocking"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They are
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Pouncey didn't play at his natural center position. He played at guard last year. Which he hasn't played since college. At center he's a sure fire pro bowler
BAH_GAWD_KING_,thanks!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes, manny Ramirez, OL from the broncos got traded to the lions last night so they could move up 5 spots"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I love jarvis but let's give him another year to prove his consistency. Easily my second favorite Dolphin though 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Speak for yourself. Tons of people like differing on topic opinions. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Compare the Dolphins and patriots without starting QBs. We have Yall beat in almost every position except LB S and TE. So I don't see how we would even be close to last 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm more excited for AFCE front 7s against your and the Cowboys OLs. Man talk about battle of the trenches 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Love me some cobb. I can't believe he isn't higher 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Oh crap, yeah thats negative i worked on this at about 3-4 this morning. ill replace it give me a few minutes.

Edit: ok fixed thanks man
"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,~ every AFCE defense 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Texans also had a Top 10 OL last season.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I got downvoted into oblivion for this because angry pats fans said that they have the best Lb corps. I fully believe that the panthers do. An the pats are right behind them 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No I think you should. The only thing DGB got in trouble for was possession of marijuana. [you can look it up here if you want :D](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorial_Green-Beckham)
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nope nope nope
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jordan Phillips was a Wr in highschoo lmfaooooo what????
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I don't know why people don't want to be informed on it but instead just pull quotes from other people in other threads and regurgitate them. But it is what it is 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No doubt in my mind that those DLines skewed these grades, but Id find it interesting I'll check it out and get back to you "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Lost arguable best DT in the NFL, lost starting LB, and DE, also remaining best LB is coming off an ACL tear. They haven't improved at all this offseason besides drafting Laken. And before you say anything, lions are my second favorite team, and I watch a lot of their games, and have been for years. They won't take the division. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup. The only TD grimey gave up all year was after the season in the pro bowl....to Jimmy Graham. So I ain't even mad 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,kraft is a billionaire why would this matter? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Holy shit why do I feel like I haven't seen you around this sub very much anymore
BAH_GAWD_KING_,All of them 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I thought he was on the raiders. But I'm not sure if he still is 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh yeah for sure the Cowboys got a fuckin steal. Best draft imo. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why the fuck are they skipping broadcasting these picks?? I'm not watching just to look on reddit to see who was picked. Fuck man
BAH_GAWD_KING_,YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE THIS TO YOU 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I never said that, I said he has a lot against him. The odds of him succeeding are low. And every pats fan I talk to seems to legitimately think he'll be able to step and perform well. If you haven't noticed, it's hard as fuck to find even a serviceable QB. Look at the Browns, and the bills, or the jets for fuck sake, or The raiders? Pats fans act like because you have bb any QB will be jesus. I remember all the hype about ryan mallet being the second brady and he isn't even close to that. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck you're making me nervous. But excited. Fuck. Shit. Man it's been so long...
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"But he still lied about it. Just because what something's are based off of doesn't make the difference. Why lie if you have nothing o cover up.

He said he didn't know his name or game day responsibilities which was wrong:

"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Hey man just be happy he brought us two championships! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He has by far the fastest offense. They way he conditions his players in practice is intense as hell. He doesn't let them slip up 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Oh I'm sure the other teams are just ecstatic that he'll be returning punts. I'm guessing They'll be rooting for the Cowboys too?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Grew up in Detroit actually
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Hey TD the dolphin wears a helmet dammit I saw him last season 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Ah poop, well jokes lately have been going way over my head lmao but AB is def my favorite player to watch. Can't wait to see what he does next year "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Or he can play it out, make 50 mil in 2 years then go to another team where he'll make more than he would now because of bigger signings and the cap rising. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Shh don't bring your logic here
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's sooooo fucking useful. I literally never clicked on those because it took so long to load, plus ads and slow speed. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"irrational hate? this has nothing to do with me not liking the pats, I've always been a brady fan. Quit the victim complex. 

and yes if you lie about something as small as that regarding an investigation it looks really bad"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's 1on1 he's not gonna look all around the field like an idiot when there's nobody else to look at. He'll most likely not stare down his receiver when they do 11on11s
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I heard someone say RT17 once. Gtfo. This ain't Star Wars 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nope only players who played the most snaps on the line. I was thinking of doing a cumulative OL chart for tomorrow when i release the WRs. So stay tuned
BAH_GAWD_KING_,DAMMIT! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The only people getting downvoted are the ones saying they think he should get in trouble. Literally first 6-7 top posts in the thread are ""I don't think brady should get in trouble"". The point of the post is our opinion on whether or not we think he should/would get in trouble. This sub can be ridiculous "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I see us taking 1 more in the 5th. We also need a LB. Hopefully we grab someone
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is cumulative not just starters. Your depth brings the position down 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Download the NFL app, it has a live stream. Pretty sweet"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's all good man, It was an exciting night"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,TRADE BACK CALLED IT! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This was for 2014
BAH_GAWD_KING_,im gonna once i finish up offense 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Wow they are milking these ads for all they got. They're like 3 picks back now wtf
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Cumulative, including depth, yes "

BAH_GAWD_KING_,FUCK YOU GUYS LMAOO 
BAH_GAWD_KING_," ""...Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant""

Edit: seriously i summarized it and y'all can't even read that? its a few paragraphs."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,man imagine Leonard Williams AND Mack! They would've breasted on D! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Month of gold says Jimmy G throws more picks than touchdowns while he is filling in for brady 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We also beat the chargers last season 37-0 but I respect your opinion I never get too hyped up about us going to the playoffs. It feels like a dream these days
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm not here to discuss the report im honestly sick of it. I've talked it to hell and it's not something I want to talk about anymore. 

Short answer: Anderson also has been said to have a shotty memory. And the other gauge used would still put a lot of the balls under the psi limit. Not by much but still under the limit "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah wtf. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So give lawyers your phone, but not your job when it could easily end all of this? "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It doesn't have to be 12.5, just between 12.5-13.5 "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Id definitely put Pouncey as a top 5 center
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Did you watch the fins vs packers game? It was extremely intense. Literally up until the final 6 seconds. God damn stupid sexy rodgers
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Gotcha i can have them either tonight or tomorrow noonish
BAH_GAWD_KING_,[Here are all his PFF grades by game](http://imgur.com/zueKWdQ) including the playoffs and SB
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You're such a fuckin great sport dude haha love this!! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's something we understand now. He want healthy last season 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lmao I'm not living in the past. But you clearly don't remember how the rest of the AFC dominated the pats before brady. Bills. And fins will take over again. It's ok to cry man. Just go light on the salt
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Just give us the W and we'll make sure suh and CAMERON wake dont kill him 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Lol you think the pats are the only dynasty ever? Ok man, keep thinking that, I know you're only like 13 and haven't watched any other team besides your beloved pats, but the steelers, dolphins, Cowboys, bills, 49ers all had massive dynasties in the 70s-00. But you're right no other team has been as good. Even the Cowboys who were way better in 90s than the pats ever have been. Save your breath you're ignorant to football cause all you say is ""my team is better than yours, brady is my fantasy man and no other team has ever been this good before"" fuck off in done here"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Bills, they deserve it after such a ridiculous history and getting so close"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,damn who the hell takes this that seriously? wtf. sorry you had to go through that dude 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,can you explain how his report is shit? You obviously didn't read even half of it if you say it's shit. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Also I left out playoffs. Just to make it even but thanks for the correction. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Mack was +6.9 before his injury if that was consistent you guys would be 2nd on the list 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,KING AS GAWD AS MAH WITNESS THAT MAN IS BROKEN IN HALF
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Thanks. I'll be releasing a cumulative list so it's a bit more accurate tomorrow. This is based off of who started the most
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah because saying Rodger is equivalent to what brady is being investigated for is completely different. You don't know your facts. Read the report if you want to know why. It's already decided that brady is going to get in trouble just stop getting salty about it. It's actually hilarious. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck yeah he is
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Damn DGB get better man
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Get your relevant opinion out of here
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Stop being salty. If you abandoned your team and fan base then just move on. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Who the hell is unproven? All of those guys have definitely proven themselves
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yup that's correct! And tell me about it, I'm jealous of all YALL "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Also his first ever TD in the NFL was a punt return. So you're just splitting hairs
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Nobody said Tom ordered them to do it, just that he knew about it. It's on the first 3 pages of the fucking report. Idk about you, but I'll trust the lawyer that spent 4 fucking months investigating this. So if you wanna be butthurt about it you can. Like I said shit happens. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah I feel you, I'm sure I'll find out your true identity soon enough batman"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,A DT getting 10 sacks is pretty impressive 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I'm with Ya man. Unemployed for a few months. Got myself clean though. So I feel better about myself going into better jobs then before. (Call centers, metro pcs, publix) I want to finally have a job I feel like is worth having. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"As much as it blows, there doesn't need to be definitive proof. The standard is believing that there's more of a chance that it actually happened"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,If there were that many that could make a difference the Jets would be one of the best teams in the league. Cause that's all they really need right now is a decent QB. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why would they? He's potentially gonna come back and play lights out on a cheap deal. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I believe in yall!! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,These need their own sub that's awesome lmfao 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You sound a little mad bro. Take a chill pill and maybe get a life and stop looking at another persons reddit comments lmfao really? you seem to have a very productive life. Enjoy your Friday night
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Didn't Kraft already say he would take those penalties? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"His run blocking is graded at +11.5 too, he's definitely going to give CJ, and Mark a big advantage "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Keeping what?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah that's crazy and I'm jealous. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,McDonald played a lot more actually that's the only reason I used him over Mack. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He wasn't freed from any punishment. He was suspended for a whole season, and 10 games the next. And now a whole season again"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Same here :/  Here's to both our teams succeeding. LOVE ME SOME LEVION AND ANTONIO
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Miami. We were ranked worst OL last season 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No I see Rishard Matthews hitting the slot instead of Jennings. OL greg isn't a slot receiver, he's more of a wr2 on our offense "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,As if there were discussion before lol 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So when is the appeal supposed to take place? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah sadly he's pretty old and injury prone at this point but i hope he stays healthy lord knows we need all the help we can get 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"PAGE 129 of the wells report: 

""He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.""


READ THE REPORT. You clearly know nothing and are just complaining without even reading the whole thing. Bias and invalid comments are all you're spouting at this point"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So you can get fucked when your team shells out a high draft pick and/or contract and lose all of it like the pats did with Hernandez? It's more than just morals, it hurts the team a lot more then you think. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,NO SHUT UP
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i know, i was bored as hell and decided to do this for each Position group for AFCE and then work my way around the league. This is my offseason fun lol  I also just finished up the WR Group for the AFCE if anyone wants to take a look "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And one measured all of them at the limit. When both officials measured every pats ball under deflated. That's a big difference
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Aaron Rodgers inflated the balls then submitted them to the refs to be inspected. That's completely different
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i didn't think of it until after i posted but i should've added up each person that played at that positions grade, and used a cumulative one so it would show TOTAL line output. Im gonna release that with the WR one I'm doing tomorrow"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"For the most part im only adding a few signature stats. Most of this stuff can be found with a Google search. I only added YPRR and WR Rating and missed tackles from sig stats. The rest are common like drop rate, snap count, drops. Would you say that's fine? I'm not adding the other 20+ categories "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,STOP HAVING DESTINY ON YOUR MIND BRUH 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well I doubt the refs are fixing the game by inflating the patriots ball. Maybe ""the refs fucked us they found out about the balls"" "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I really hope so. I don't follow college ball, you mind telling me why? "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Incognito didn't play last year
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think all of our DLs are sitting somewhere grinning about this. This division has both the worst OLs and best DLs, it's insane"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Let's hope he doesn't bring his brother. Those two together will ruin any chance 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Sheard was extremely mediocre on the browns. You also lost your top 4 CBs from last year. that secondary is almost a joke honestly
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"What would wells possibly have to hide? he publicly told Yee to release anything that he hadn't yet. Because he had nothing to hide. To say that brady literally refused to cooperate in this aspect, its easy to say that bradys camp has more to hide"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Just don't forget the last QB that only played in a spread offense that YALL had. Tim tebow. And we all know how that worked out. Cut after the preseason. There are limited things a spread offense QB can do in the pros. But I guess we'll have to see 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And he's had injury issues right? Or was that from something else? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Um. Inflating them and turning them into the refs to be inspected isn't the same as telling a fucking ball boy to secretly deflate them AFTER they were tested. Get your head out of your ass. We get it, you're salty"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Considering we've also had the worst ranked OL the last two seasons(one of which was historically the worst in history)  it's way more impressive for tannehill to pull off what he has. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"But he most likely won't win. NFL has more of a right to do what they feel is best than Tom has to play. It's a job, that's how it works. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I know lol I'm scared he doesn't have much time left at this level. He's been fantastic. But 33 years old yeesh
BAH_GAWD_KING_,WOW!! FUCK YEAH! Rams won't be disappointed imo!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,How is it baseless? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No problem. And yeah that's seems good to me! I'll be posting every divisions OL chart tomorrow if you'd be interested in that as well.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But you're saying best ever. That'sa stretch 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Brady also has one of, if not, the fastest release in the game. So it's likely that he got the ball off before his line screwed him over"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I got my gold thanks again strange Broncos fan! We bet that mariota would be taken by the Eagles. I said he wouldn't. WOOP!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He played better than a 5th rounder so i agreed with the trade for sure. Just hope Ellerbe isn't as bad for you guys as he was for us
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Not even going to read this. You're taking it too seriously. Congrats! If it makes your ego bigger, the steelers are the best at super bowl. They can football very good. Done here"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You know not all cap space rolls over right? Like it depends on what contract cap hits you have for that year. That's why one year the team could be fucked and the next be perfectly fine. And you're right it's not bad for the fins. Pay our QB, pro bowl center, pro bowl left tackle AND the best DT in the NFL, sounds good to me. Rest of our offense is extremely young "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yup, one of my best friends got pulled over, she was stupidly smoking weed in the car, had weed, grinder and a bubbler(paraphernalia  and intent to distribute as well as DUI) got offered pre trial an when she's done in 9 months it's all off her record and also her bail money is returned to her. It's common "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And one of philbin a seasons was a 7-9. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think it has a lot to do with how bad the rest of the line was honestly, riddled with injuries and what not"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"mcnally and jastremski both said that brady knew him and his duties, including mcnally hearing personally from brady of his ball inflation preferences. 2 people against 1. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Only for WRs, because there are so many different stats. I won't be adding this much with any other position. I'll do a ton of them and remove which ones I think aren't necessary. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Uh...ok? I still said steelers have that one. And Cowboys are an extremely close second. Chill out I'm sorry you can't handle another team being mentioned when talking about lots of Super Bowls. My point stands and you're being very picky and defensive because I named the Cowboys lmao 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah i only did because Mcdonald played most snaps at C
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You're crazy if you don't think tannehill is a franchise QB. 32nd ranked OL 3 years running and he's improved every year. Last season:

4059yds 27tds 12ints 66.4% completion percentage. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think if they go 0-4 or 1-3 it'd hurt, otherwise I don't see it making a difference honestly. The pats are still serious contenders if 2-2 or higher without Brady. Also it's week 6 because of your early bye week "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No problem it was fun
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah i know this was based off of who played more snaps at the position last year 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,AMARI COOPER!! MAYOCK IS 4 for 4 so far on his mock draft holy shit
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm fine with this 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And Reshad jones opposite of mccourty 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It's boring. I'm about 100 pages in, but I like to be as informed as possible"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lmao damn i should've put more into this before posting.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I don't blame greg and Jake, both thrown into the position way earlier than needed because of injuries "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yes because me misreading something is going to be used in a court of law. You could've not been a douchebag about it. Mistakes happen 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"That's very doubtful. I feel like using that context is a huge stretch. ""You should deflate a little bro"" that doesn't even right when you say it. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think if Pouncey plays healthy and stays at center, also if Albert just stays healthy, and we don't throw Ju'Wuan at LT when he isn't ready, we should be ok "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He'll probably do that at 11on11 drills not a 1 on 1 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,All we got left is a 4th and 3 5ths. So I hope we make em count
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He never said he wanted to sneak them on the field. He said he over inflated them THEN TURNED THEM INTO THE REFS TO BE INSPECTED. Completely different. This has been talked to death. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"LB, LG and RG. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah it's the season totals. If you'd like when I get home I can comment again with his game by game grade? Up to you I should be home in a few hours
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Aaron Rodgers is completely different. He inflated the balls and then turned them into the Refs to be inspected. This whole thing with brady is that they were tampered with AFTER inspection. Don't compare the two without knowing facts 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I would've loved an orange alt
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"If you won Super Bowls better, then you guys would have the most Super Bowls. That'd be the steelers and Cowboys. But I'll give you gronk "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,:D I can't wait for the season to start 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Homer glasses off I think we have better WRs then the bills but the rest of this is correct
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah about to start working on the rest now 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Go for it be weary of injury issues. The ACL and elbow last year were brutal. He'd be awesome behind your line tho 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ertz is a TE though. I wanted to do 4 WRs and 1 TE
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I mean they did last offseason.

Signed franchise LT Albert
Drafted First Round OT  Juwuan James 
Extended Pro Bowl/Franchise Center Mike Pouncey

Albert got injured Week 9 and graded out positive while he he did play. 

JuWuan Played just fine at RT but was forced into LT becasue of Alberts injury.

Pouncey had hip surgery before  the season and was starting at Guard instead of his natural Center position. We would've probably had at least an average line if all these shitty things didn't happen"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It wasn't fair and certain during Bullygate, and also they're corporate lawyers, so it only makes sense"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's not true. Your opinion is different and you have no factual basis you're just bashing and I don't agree with it. Now take your God complex somewhere else I'm done with this entire topic. Made me realize what a joke this sub can be. Woke up -85 in this sub because people can't take a differing opinion. In the end brady will still be suspended. I'm done here and staying far away from these bullshit thread
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But Lebron tho. Too clutch 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I just posted my analysis on the report in here, with direct quotes and cites, and I'm getting down voted.

 I used to down vote people that said ""/r/patriots2"" but it really is becoming just that. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He also said he didn't know his name or game day responsibilities which was wrong:

PAGE 129:

He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference.

anything else? please read the report"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Switch Rams and Broncos and you have my opinion 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That was my first thought as well. Clearly just cost him millions of guaranteed money. I would look into it if I were him 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Swapping them out makes you guys number two on the list. Then again Mack barely played and had a grade of +6.9. But you guys would easily be top 3
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tannehill wasn't on the hot seat. He had one bad game and philbin criticized him for it. Then tanny thought he had a big dick and told the media that he wouldn't get benched. That's the only bad thing said about him is going against philbin declaring he wouldn't be benched
BAH_GAWD_KING_,":( .... On the bright side he did fantastic for what a shit OL he had. 4,059 yds 27tds 12 ints, 66.4% completion%"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,To say that deflate meant lost weight is a massive reach. Any say otherwise is just homerism at its finest. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,HOLY FUCK GUYS!!!! HOLY FUCK 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Arrested development. One of the funniest shows I've watched. And you get to see a young Michael cera be awkward and such 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Joe Montana football is coming this summer. Supposed to rival madden but they don't have the license for the NFL. So no team names/player names. But on PC I'm sure a mod will come out to make it whole again 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yes thats correct thanks ill make the edit
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Nah their only real holes have ever been on the OL and QB. Which are big pieces to miss imo 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"15 season ban lmao yes please.

His body post said ""15 season ban"" instead of game. Chill out Yall damn"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"-0.4. 223 snaps. 16 Rec. 260 yds 16.3 yds/rec. 120 YAC, 2 drops, 6 broken/avoided tackles"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You have to understand our OL was bad last year because Albert got injured, Pouncey was injured before the season and was moved to RG instead of C where he is a pro bowler. we forced our first round rookie RT into LT and had dallas Thomas, the definition of a turnstile hitting RT. And fuck Sam satele, can't believe we let him start over Pouncey. If all goes well, we should see a massive upgrade next year. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,hah no worries it was fun
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is the most garbage site out there. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Same :(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Fact is, there won't be any more findings. All were waiting on it the punishment. So all this bs about us talking about if it happened or not is pointless. Just wait for the punishment and stick by your team, it's the best you could do "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Reshad jones is one of the best strong safeties in the NFL and Brent grimes is one of the best corners in the NFL. Delmas is consistent as hell. And tannehill threw for 4000+ yards 27tds and 12 ints. Lamar miller had 5.1 YPC last year with 1099 yds 8 TDs, 38 receptions 275 yds. So I wouldn't say that's blah. Way to downplay a solid team by not knowing anything about them "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Alright bud, be in denial lmao "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It was the ball boy pumping tie balls to 16 psi not the refs...
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Parker to Browns calling it
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Also a nice way to cheer up after hearing bad news if you do win the bet
BAH_GAWD_KING_,MARCEL HAVE MERCY ON DIS BOY SOUL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Depth. Not just starters. But everyone that played center
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"This thread is almost unreadable at this point. Everyone saying ""this is stupid"" is getting upvoted to shit."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm super curious to where Gregory goes 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jake fisher still on the board! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I believe that's our teal Nike alternates. Looks a bit over saturated though. But yeah I love em 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck it dude I don't care anymore. You can see the clear rape in this thread. It's not even funny anymore at this point. Woke up -85 total in this thread. Every one of my comments. From simple questions to on topic comments. It's a joke and I can't believe the mods let this crap leak out into the rest of the sub
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah I'm sure thats the reason as well, and same for the NFCW"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I don't think you watched enough Rams football or Dolphins football. Tannehill just in 2013 was sacked 59times. This is that same line except without Pouncey.
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I honestly can't wait to watch deandre Hopkins. Love that guy
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Martin played a lot more snaps, that's what I went by "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Dude chill out. Why are you getting so angry over Internet comments? Lmao but sure you might be right and I misread, but hey let's cuss out the guy that's not being a dick and just be a straight up cock to him. Prick "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,😁
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But if you prepared his specific everyday tools to use. He would know you. Sorry you're a peon 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Sorry it took so long guys, long week plus lots of stats/grades. Took longer than i thought. Love y'all.

**EDIT**:

also gotta add this disclaimer before i get 100 comments saying the same thing: PFF is not the End all be all of grades, i understand this. Its just a rough look at how each individual player has done in 2014. 

Also, what would you guys like to see next? Thinking of starting defense. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He doesn't. You can tell by the played out ""marioto"" line that he's karma grabbing "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No I'm sorry no guard was better than yanda last year. Not taking anything away from the guy, he's good, just yanda is ridiculous "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Inflamed buttholes
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Isn't he like 2nd all time in YPC? He's a monster. I wish him health, and I hope he keeps on beasting"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Anyone see Kevin hart yet? I saw him last week and I was in tears the whole time. I was also fortunate enough to have front row seats!!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He played lights out last season. Shitty OL every year including the 3rd worst OL in NFL history. 59 sacks in 2013 and 43 in 2014. 

4059yds 27 TDs and 12 ints 66.4% completion percentage. He's definitely not a no name QB "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Even tho I love tannehill. Id kill to have a guy like Big Ben as my QB. He's an absolute beast 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Nah, he deserves a second chance just like everyone else. And not even that but the bills need a solid guard, and incognito is solid as fuck at guard"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ill have it done either tonight or tomorrow. ill just do every division and put them into an album for you guys and post them tomorrow. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Why do we have to hate the pats or not have read the report to think its a fair punishment? I read the whole thing and submitted a thorough analysis on it and I still think it's fine. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So he was dismissed then? Not enough evidence to prove it? Frank Clarks case has multiple witnesses and he has a record of being a theif. Clark wasn't cleared. DGB was. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The Rams are the underdogs of that division imo. I love the Rams, been tied as my second favorite team with the lions since I could remember. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Whooo! McCain! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I almost Curtis Martin once. I was visiting a family member in prison and he was sitting next to me talking to one of his as well. I was too nervous to say hi 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,/r/Texans 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yup I'll have to start them when I get home in a few hours 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah i only did the guys who started or played the most snaps at the position. I might be releasing a cumulative chart tomorrow so that might be more accurate. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The wheelin dealin WOOOO, girl stealin WOOO, son of a gun WOOO WISKEY DRINKING WOOO"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This isn't cumulative just gone by starting OL
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"[Yep i saw it, the psi differences wouldn't even make a difference](http://imgur.com/ZldDFqB) still below 12.5"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Not really 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"He did very well against the run last year, just from the games I've watched. He can hit the edge so well "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Isn't romos cap hit this season like 28mm?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I think the pats would basically be what the jets were last year and it'd be a fight between the fins and bills for the division.  
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Guys I think he actually died and couldn't finish his sentence. Fuck, bro you ok?"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Didn't the colts gm call and warn them way before they got blown out. I doubt that has anything to do with it
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Id probably cry 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You already have one?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And honestly I don't see it. I don't see Jimmy as starter quality. I mean he very well could but the odds of having another good to great QB are extremely low
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Wait I thought he said he was a saints fan? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Prepare yourselves boys, theres'a shit storm a brewin "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The NFL gave him the option to show them what was relevant to the investigation, and even said he could turn them in through his lawyer. It just looks bad imo "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Bill fuckin burr. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Rip Jimmy G
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So hype! Now only if we had a solid guard....
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I think he meant more as a collective 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"What I never understood is why not just give up the phone records? If apparently they want it to go to court, where all his relevant phone records will be asked for, then why not just cooperate then take it to court after you appeal and are still unsatisfied? "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hell yeah, especially with signing Orlando Franklin!"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So he went this far to prevent texts with a ball boy and equipment manager from being leaked? 

Edit: downvote button is reserved for off topic comments. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Good idea I'll do that I forgot he got traded Mid season 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Barring injuries, i think well step it up fairly soon"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah just a mistake. I always make a few mistakes :/ 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But when talking about teams having more than I am using it right. I said if they were the best they would have the most. Cowboys and steelers are both above the pats in Super Bowls wins 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"It was an independent investigator. As much as nobody wants to believe it, he was in fact independent and neutral. Neither of them had any reason not to be

Edit: and now you see why everyone complains about pats fans downvoting. Logical fact Downvoted while bias complaint upvoted. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's great 😂
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I started to do it but it's tough because of the 3-4 and 4-3 defenses. Different positions and what not but I'll give it a shot anyway even though it won't look as nice 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,WHY A DT?? LMAO! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,😢
BAH_GAWD_KING_,How is it bold? they were 4-12 last season
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Show me in the report where it says otherwise. The texts between the ball boy and eq manager said 16 psi. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,All I really heard last season on NFLN was how much of a workload MURRAY was getting a huge workload and it'll take a toll. I had no idea Lesean ran that much damn 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Whaaaat? No i didn't but that's awesome that other people are using this. Glad I can show people how our line was after all the injuries and switching around our line did last year. Do you have a link to that by chance?

"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,No! This is Patrick! 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"By all means, go for it. I was going to release a full cumulative score tomorrow along with the WRs. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,God damn that AFCN is green across the board! And holy hell Marshal Yanda's Grade was the highest I've seen for 2014!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The headphones have a microphone and they were holding up their phones. I'm almost 100% sure they were talking to them through the headsets
BAH_GAWD_KING_,There are people that work there that aren't interns. That's why I asked. Idk why everyone has to be rude 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No Problem! :D

"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man I could only dream of this
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i feel you, who knows, i just wanted to present my findings. Thanks for being reasonable"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,THANK GOD
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I never said that, i inferred that thats the reason for investigation. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"""MAH JAGUARS""

And the way he said Louisville, ewwww.

""Lew-uh-vil"""
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The jets and fins improved a lot this offseason too. It's not like they're the only ones that got better. Especially missing one of, if not, the biggest piece to an offense. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,What's the point in coming in a thread and just disregarding the question then? There isn't one. If you dont want either choice then dont comment. Simple as that 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,FUCK
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah while grading these I noticed a lot of teams would. It's crazy how many teams had lost players and had to switch their line up. Almost got confused with the Broncos, manny and Louis both shifted over. Manny went from RG to C and Louis from RT to RG. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I agree, if it wasn't for that lowered contract you guys gave ellerbe i would've said we got a steal. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I upvoted you because this comment made me laugh really fucking hard
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hernandez is looking at 3 murders, that's worse that OJ and suggs. No reasoning to believe otherwise"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,The day that brady gets cleared and gets a small fine I'll be taking my day off from /r/NFL 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Bruh 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,it definitely will be goodell. the only owner angry at him is Kraft. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,&lt;3
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I think all that is stupid but the picture is about him lying, not cheating. 


PAGE 129:

He claimed that prior to the events surrounding the AFC Championship Game, he did not know McNally‟s name or anything about McNally‟s game-day responsibilities, including whether McNally had any role relating to game balls or the game officials. We found these claims not plausible and contradicted by other evidence. In fact, during his interview, Jastremski acknowledged that Brady knew McNally and McNally‟s role as Officials Locker Room attendant. Similarly, McNally told NFL Security that he had been personally told by Brady of Brady‟s inflation level preference "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That was after being downvoted. After 6-7 actual comments. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Why? i see tons of questions being posted outside the megathread, this is information a lot of people overlook and haven't payed attention to. Its relevant"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I only do it because it's an easy identifier tbh 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Except in our 2013 season tannehill was sacked 59 times and is literally tied 2nd for worst OL in NFL history. And last year we were ranked 32nd in the league in OL. So it's not me just pulling it out of my ass. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,How am I not listening to reason? You stated texts from the report and so did I? Or did I disprove you and you have nothing to come back from? It's ok to get mad 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Damn ok, I was about to say, because on NFLN they said something about June. And I'm just like Jesus man can we just find out already? Lol "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Honestly dude I don't even care if we lose a playoff game. Just making playoffs would make me happy. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah i feel you, idk if you remember, you might not, but i used to be a pretty big contributor here too, but deleted my account. /u/DollfinJesus [I made all the schedule threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/27n95a/team_132_2014_schedule_discussion_new_england/) from last offseason. 

I didn't delete my account for anything as crazy as yours just personal reasons mostly "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,If it goes to court he's going to have to turn over his texts and emails. So this whole thing would've been pointless because brady could've just given it to them in the first place and it wouldn't have looked nearly as bad
BAH_GAWD_KING_,There's 32 owners dude. Just because Kraft isn't on his side there's still a majority of owners who want Goodell to stay 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,hey man the fins' overall grade is like 100 points less even with your 3rd string center playing 75 percent of the year :( be happy dammit
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Let's hope that OL holds up. I mean I won't be hoping it does, but I'll send a prayer his way "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,BAH GAWD 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Pleeeeeaaaassseeeeeee. Id love this great video man 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"/u/dollfinjesus I did all those schedule discussions last offseason. You may not remember me, I tried not to stand out to much "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Never said anything about downvotes. But he is clearly within the guidelines of commenting rules. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I mean, do you want him back? lol "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Just ignore him. Same guy who said that tannehill, grimes, Reshad jones, lamar miller and our entire wr corpse was below average. And then went on to brag about ""pats SB champs and only dynasty ever"". Let's not feed the troll. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is supposed to be last years line 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hah yeah I know, but I've never met an American that referred to their grade as ""grade x"" it's always like ""I'm in the 11th grade"" or something like that. Also marks, you never hear that around here. It's just ""my grade"" but that's cool, plenty of Canadian NFL fans   "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"thats definitely not true, they are going to use any and/or all texts that are related to get to the conclusion. Which would have been the same ones that wells used. Idk why every pats fan thinks theres some sort of agenda"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,NATURAL DISASTERS DOE
BAH_GAWD_KING_,And the victim complex continues 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,To be fair staff has had a 5k season. That's pretty damn impressive. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,http://imgur.com/D0aGscS
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"fuck him man, I'm so ready to get rid of him"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I mean brady did lie about certain things so it does look a bit bad.  
BAH_GAWD_KING_,We gave him the nickname Lazor beam in our sub. We love that guy. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Sorry I was working on this at like 3-4 in the morning and didn't pay attention. I'll fix it in my spreadsheet
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This was just posted like 5 minutes before yours 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,haha just a little bit!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I mean everyone is entitled to their own opinion, no matter how stupid you may think it is"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Sounds good so Revis Mo Wilk and Richardson all going to walk at the end of their contracts. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Then how do you explain a ridiculous drop off  when playing center to guard? he graded out very positive and top 10 in centers every year at Center. And its way below threshold at guard. he was garbage at guard. There are tons of differences, because Guards also have to help double team DEs"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Ryan tannehill. He's improved so much. With that ass of an OL he shouldn't have put up those numbers 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah... the only position of need that we really lack is OG. Everywhere else is pretty damn solid. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Because people are interested in it. They have hundreds of stats for each position. It's not like im laying all of that down 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Since you guys don't believe me. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZourGM6KRo

Watch number 77 blow all his assignments when he was on the fins in 2013"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is supposed to be last years line
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Worth 120 million yes, but the NFL is a multi BILLION dollar corporation, that is punishing their player as they see fit for breaking company policy. It's how it is with any job. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Shit you might be right. I'll go back and take a look when I get some time. I know made one mistake. That might have been it, can't remember, but someone pointed it out in the thread. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The Rams only have 1-2 of those guys coming back next season and the fins got rid of colledge, satele, and Shelley smith. Our line will be pretty dann different as well hopefully for the better. and man, Nonldy deserves John jerry  starting on their team "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,This is on the front page
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Because its cumulative at the position, not just starters, depth as well"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Almost all of Benjamin stats came in garbage time when the panthers were down 2 TDs 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Where are you seeing all this hate? I haven't seen any hate on them 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Stay tuned for cumulative grades tomorrow 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,She definitely did. I'll look for the article 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yup,  and in court brady will have to give up his phone records. So this whole not cooperating thing will have been pointless. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I was comparing all of our OLs from last season. Used QB hits, hurries, sacks allowed. At each position. The jets have the best OL in our division by a large margin. Fins and bills are neck and neck but the bills are just slightly worse than us. The pats OL was much better than both of ours but not better than the jets. The jets actually had a top 3rd OL last season from my stat sheet"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah some of these were a bit surprising, again, not all of these guy played all season. For example, Ju'Wuan James the OT we drafted last year only got to play 9 games at RT before having to switch over to LT in his rookie year, and pouncey coming back from injury and playing at guard was a dumb move.  so it is a bit skewed in that aspect.

Edit: LT not RT"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I'm out getting dinner with my mom at the moment but if you give me the name of the players then I'll throw the grades at Ya when I get home
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I miss him :(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That shouldn't have anything to do with it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That's going to be released later with the wrs chart. A cumulative of each position since I forgot to make one until after I posted this
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Eli 3-1 against brady. Eli confirmed goat 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Dude on point with all the highlights thanks!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah I get you want to defend brady. But it's pointless. I'll take a page from pats fans. No proof. There wasn't a screaming match where the coach was being pushed back. Brady was wrong here. You don't argue with your coach 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,But I still wouldn't call it bold
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You should be good, just honestly keep to yourself for the most part when around bug touristy areas. Also, most importantly, have fun. I envy you, wish I'd be able to do something like this "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Didn't johnny play like less than 2 games though? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Haha yeah it's nice for us to look at the bright spot isn't it? I mean we only have 1 each :( 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,4700yds 40tds 15ints aint bad for a 3rd year QB
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Well all that needs to be said is ""Tom Brady more probable than not knew of the incident""

So by that footnote it's already been decided. It sucks, I don't think it's that big of a deal, but shit happens"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Actually no the NFLPA didn't advise brady on anything. Idk why people keep bringing this up 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hell yeah we should message the mods about it, and hope it works out! "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Except tannehill has had tissue paper protecting him all 3 years. Including 2013 when he was sacked 59 times and last season when he was sacked 40. Worst ranked OL every year he's been with us. Luck has a bad OL but better WRs and he came into the league more pro ready than tannehill 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"The accuser has stated openly that she would never be with a black guy, even tho her boyfriend was black. A little relevant"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,yup...fuck :(
BAH_GAWD_KING_,8
BAH_GAWD_KING_,I personally think either saints or falcons win the division this year
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Old navy brah
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Depends on what these other issues are. I really like the guy. He's a top 10 prospect
BAH_GAWD_KING_,You're literally talking about the headline in news. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He'll probably get tagged Tho 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Great pick for the falcons!!
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck dallas Thomas. Why do we still have him on the team?? Seriously annoys me
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Matt Kassel 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He overinflates them then hands them to the refs for inspection. Completely different
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Yeah 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"One last thing, they talk about the physical AND enviornmental conditions not making a difference in the report. Yet again another person that didn't even read it. This is why this thread is pointless, i actually know what I'm talking about:

**PAGE 131**:

Based on the testing and analysis, however, Exponent concluded that, within the range of likely game conditions and circumstances studied, they could identify no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the Patriots halftime measurements or for the additional loss in air pressure exhibited by the Patriots game balls, as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the Colts game balls. Dr. Marlow agreed with this conclusion. This absence of a credible scientific explanation for the Patriots halftime measurements tends to support a finding that human intervention may account for the additional loss of pressure exhibited by the Patriots balls."
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Conversely to say he will succeed like its guaranteed  is just as stupid. There is such a thing as preseason warriors. People who consistently play very well in the preseason but can't play well against the starters where the games actually matter. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Your DL is hardly going to give any team ""fits"". Without brady, your offense is a bit mediocre and defense has no secondary with stacked LBs, and an unproven DL.

Also, More probable than not, ACCORDING TO BRADYS LAWYER, means at least 50.1% of a chance, so yeah, very possible
"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's a 4hour old account I highly doubt this guy will do shit 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Id say the packers have a better one. Jordy, cobb and Adams is way better"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yes but my question is, can he play guard and if so can I have him "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I hope so, that man needs the respect he deserves. I made a post asking about everyone's opinion on him not long ago. someone said ""who? That should answer your question"" "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Tom Brady takes a Senzu bean* 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Over. But yeah just ignore what I said anyway. I'm sure the God complex all you pats fans have will shrivel away when old man brady is done in a year or two 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,He also said he didn't know the guy he was giving free stuff to after he had already given it to him. He said he didn't even know THe dudes name. If it was that normal he wouldn't be hiding it. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Uh yes it was. Pouncey was injured for a little less than half the season and Albert went down week 9. You don't sound like you know what you're talking about 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Definitely didn't say that, I said he was dismissed so if the Hawks did draft him nobody would be talking about it. Clarks is e everywhere **BECAUSE THERE IS STILL NEW INFORMATION BEING BROUGHT UP** "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Seriously haven't seen a fan base this upset about a ruling in my life
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck you're making me nervous I'm not ready for this kind of pressure
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It's not cumulative of depth or SoS
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"But was he suspended for two games? I could've sworn he was suspended indefinitely and was cut from the team immediately. People keep bringing this up and forget he was punished by the usual consequences for his offense, and then it was blown up and he was given more severe punishment. You can't really. I pare the two anyway. Different infractions"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Seeing as how I don't know anything about college football you're 100% thinking of someone else
BAH_GAWD_KING_,It is against the CBA rules to not cooperate. Especially being caught lying it just looks bad. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"You can't say that malcolm brown is an improvement over wilfork when we haven't even seen him play in the NFL yet. Same with the other defensive players you drafted. Easely has struggled with injuries going back to high school all the way up to last season. Y'all have good linebackers for sure and i can't count out Dmac. But its still huge question mark. Its completely not out of the question to say its possible y'all go 1-3. especially against the bills, steelers and cowboys"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Hasnt Dalton been to the playoffs every year he started? By that logic then he would be top 5, which he isn't "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"&gt; Brady personally was involved in the 2006 rule change that allowed each visiting team to supply its own game balls in accordance with the preferences of its quarterback""

He was one of the biggest voices in the change in rules and claimed to not have known. Are you just nitpicking? cause that was in the same paragraph"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"To be fair, brady has a really team friendly contract. But assuming we're talking about getting him a new contract then yeah I agree"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Very true. On that note, I'm very fucking excited about landry. I do think he has potential to be a top 10 WR in the NFL in the next years to come. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Fuck. I know when I find out I'm gonna smack myself. 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lol this'll get deleted. Post in /r/patriots
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"So rodgers, but no link for the others? Let's see it"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Jets going full on defense this draft. CAUSE THEYLL BE ON DEFENSE 3 QUARTERS OF THE GAME AMIRITE?
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Actually I'm watching espn right now and they're talking about the game yesterday. Quit the victim complex dude
BAH_GAWD_KING_,They were ok with ahmad bradshaw before that injury. Man I felt so bad for him
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Man I miss Karlos dansby. I loved that big fella
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"No it's pretty common knowledge that QB is the hardest position to transition into the pros and that there is an extremely low success rate at the position. But no ""patriots QB God brady Goatropolo all QBs are jesus"" that's what you sound like. Instead of realizing how fucking hard it is to find a QB. Learn football scrub you sound like the biggest idiot homer in the world. 

And nah miami has a pretty damn good QB already :)"
BAH_GAWD_KING_,That doesn't say much. I'm sure he wore a jacket most of the time because it was cold. That doesn't mean deflate means lose weight. It just seems like a massive reach 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Brent grimes and Drew Brees as well 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,Lol god I hate her so much. She's the equivalent of an NFL players parent ranting 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Nice. I should have WRs done by tomorrow. I'm honestly just going to add almost every stat since there people consistently asking for more. Just wanna make everyone happy, it's the offseason lol "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"looking at it now, Barnes played 12 more snaps but also 3 less starts at RT. Barnes Moved to LG for i think 5 games and skewed it. But if it helps, barnes played better. Overall as OT he graded at -7.2 compared to watsons -17.2. "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"Yeah that's honestly probably it. Wake would have a small chance if he didn't go to the CFL, but it's not his fault the Giants cut him "
BAH_GAWD_KING_,So at least 50.1% chance then? 
BAH_GAWD_KING_,"I never said that the Bills wouldn't win, but you said the fins would get the 1st pick. When they are better than the pats in every position other than those i listed. Also you're talking about a season where the Entire division was much weaker and the pats had arguably one of the easiest schedules of the decade and a great defense. which Yall don't have anymore as well as a much stronger division than 7 years ago "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Don't forget about Flutie putting on Brady's helmet and hearing radio comm past the 15 second cutoff....

Cheaters gonna cheat"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I love Reggie man, he's probably the best player in the history of our franchise, of the more modern era at the very least.

But I just think Watt is that damn good."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"/u/onesonesones just posted the 4th Q in the other thread about comebacks, but I think the INT happened in the 3rd

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLLJbhEnGGs&amp;t=39m00s"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think NO's makes sense as has been speculated, Payton said yesterday he thought he would go by the end of the day, he grew up in LA, went to LSU, and the Saints could use him for sure.

Just makes the most sense"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol oh noooesss he down voted me, not my precious internet points!!!

People this guy went through my profile and tried to down vote as many posts as he could he was so butthurt.

I'm soooo unfunny that he made it a point to remember me lol

You are a sad and pathetic little man, who's tagline for /r/nfl as far as I've seen is : ""ya, you are right, I made that up""

lollllllllll tell me about Fletcher and Chung again, I need a good laugh"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol so not my point, and again, cherry picking again by you avoiding the question, seems to be your forte.  Because BB had never done it before, meant he never would ever?  Because that was your point with KC, a very weak point, but you tried.

Draft grades?  Draft grades???  KC liked him enough to take him in the 1st....it doesn't matter what Kiper or McShay thinks, it matter what Andy Reid and the KC coaches and FO thinks about his ""grade"".  I'm sure Reid doesn't say ""well look guys, Kiper gave him this grade, don't get your hopes up"".  Dude your retorts are weak as fuck.

Kiddo, LOL.  Bud, the King never has to say ""I'm the King""

You tried holier than thou, do a bit more praying beforehand next time you wanna step up mmmkkkk, because you just have dodging reaching weak sauce post after post.

Buhhh byeeeee"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You are really underestimating Fletcher Cox in those games, did we blitz?  Of course we did.  Does that mean we blitzed on every down?

We were in Cover 3 or Cover 1 for a lot of those games, and in the second game especially, Cowboys would go empty backfield 5 wide...where did you see we were blitzing the LB's more than we did any other game?

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Donte Stallworth
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So is everyone, but Pats fans are saying ""Bradley Fletcher only sucked because it was Philly""

But now that he's on NE he'll be fine, Arrington, he sucked tho, that's why he was released..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm betting that's not the way ""I've been to two SB's in three years of career"" Wilson/his agent is looking at it...

Have no doubt they are gonna wanna top Rodgers' guarantee now"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yep, Cutler wasn't in the echelon of the Top 5 guys, but he still got paid.  Flacco too.

Carolina isn't gonna lose Cam under any circumstances, he's getting paid top dollar"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Only if your salary was higher than the tag, like the Lions with Suh this year, his salary was higher than the tag, so they would have had to give him like $22M.

It's based on the average of the Top 5 or Top 10 QB salaries.  The more consecutive years you tag the higher it gets, because there is escalating bumps.

As for this situation and Houston's for that matter - the Franchise tag actual money, the checks, get handed out by game, they are 17 game cheques.  If he sits, he doesn't get paid."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The guy linked me to one....and it was a still, I couldn't even see what is being pointed out"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Didn't he say he wanted to play tackle before he even signed with the Cowboys?

That being said, it's way too early to set anything like this in stone, still a lot of camps to go"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They won't give it to a defensive player ever again I don't think.

If Watt didn't win his rookie year, I dunno what more you can do as a player.

Even this year too, not that Rodgers and AP didn't deserve it, but what this guy does is crazy, taking on doubles and triples a lot of the time too while doing it.

LT was the last defensive player that will ever win most likely."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You said he was better, that denotes that you've at least done some research to actually, y'know, qualify that....

I mean, I wouldn't think a Patriots fan would just jump to conclusions and say any random thing BB does is amazing and much better than anyone else with no basis, amirate /u/dmacisabeast...

...dmac??"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""Newbie"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"TT knows his ""type""...or is it Aaron's ""type""

I'm kidddddinngggg"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And I'm saying pound for pound, it's a theorized discussion, where I stated that yes, QB is the most important, I get that.

What he said doesn't add much, it's posting just to post"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not counting any of the injured QB seasons, because we've had a lot of them over the last 10 years, I'd say Dallas in 2009 Week 17, it was for HFA for the Wild Card/seeding and we got smoked.

Also Redskins 2008 sticks with me, Week 16.  We started out bad, had the terrible tie with Cincy (yes this is the one where McNabb didn't know games could end in a tie), got killed by the Ravens, McNabb was benched at halftime in that game, things looked bleak, we are hanging on by a thread in the playoff race, then comeback and go on a win streak starting against Arizona, Dallas loses on Saturday night in Week 16 to the Ravens and we can put ourselves in the drivers seat, and we put up one of the biggest stinkers (granted Skins had a good D that year) I can remember, big time sloppiness.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Word was his knee is messed up on the level of Marcus Lattimore, not just a simple ACL tear"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol the worst player out of all players in the NFL.

Granted, this is before he started playing a bit better last season when he had to come in because we had so many injuries.

He beat Tyron Smith off the edge and made Tony Romo sack himself, and Tyron even had a massive hold on the play too, if that means anything to you."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Neither did Cutler, but yet, he was.....

It's about the position and the current market, whoever signs there deal the most recent has the biggest deal typically.  Wilson is next up, Cutler and Flacco weren't the best either, but they got theres and they were the top deals."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I know that....

I'm saying when Gruden came in as coach, not just localizing on rookie years"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, it's like Michael Irvin dropped some passes....he was good, alright, but left too much meat on the bone in his career...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They very well could...but don't forget, the Cowboys had a pretty good trio in Barber/Jones/Choice some years back, and they never stayed even close to disciplined with running the ball as they did with Murray last year.  And Garrett was the OC.

And your idea sounds great on paper, but part of it was Murray wearing the defenses down as well.  If you look at the ratios of carries, he'll have to carry alot more than 50 times to be part of a group that supplants the amount of carries Murray had.  Production typically goes down for spell backs when that happens, from a YPC standpoint anyway."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Fair enough man, my apologies.

It's just this isn't anything that wasn't expected, Bradford said as much himself the day he got here and Chip as well."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Couldn't it be fair to say that it's simply the *perception* that Matt Ryan is boring, while RG3 is fun loving eating 12"" Sweet Chicken Teriyaki's and Kaep keeps it real with the Beats by Dre's?

For all we know Matt Ryan does super cool shit with his life that we never see, that's kinda what he's saying."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Shhh....he'll be magically faster
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This is pretty old news man, everyone knows this already"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Good signing, back with the Shanahan blocking scheme where he is a bit better of a fit"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I mean look at your pettiness even now, you are reporting every posts, yet you and I are the only ones reading this, and you are down voting.

You are full of it man

Here, I'm gonna up vote all your posts now to show you how much it doesn't matter, and that you are missing the point, and that you are damn petty for reporting all the posts you are.

It's guys like you that are ruining this sub right now"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Gregory would probably have been Top 10
ImTheOnlyChipHere,That game was pretty crazy
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"People doubt Foster too much, the guy gets hurt but he's a damn good back"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt;Brady: “You good Jonny boy?”
...
Brady: “You doing good?”
...
Jastremski: “Still nervous; so far so good though”

Good enough for you?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Byyyyeeeee
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea if all I have to do is take him out for a play, I have to rotate and sub anyway, so when I'm about to take a guy off, just have him go whap the QB.  I'm taking him off anyway.

It would be Bountygate all over again, and would totally go against what the league has been doing trying to protect QB's"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For skill positions it still has some merit, for the less glamorous like OL or interior DL (non edge rusher), it seems to be much more about name recognition."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt;Will our RBs beat 2009, when we were the 7th ranked? It's possible. But I don't think there's anything kinda off in thinking we can beat 2007 and 2008, when we were 17th and 21st. Nothing off about that.

Doubtful, the OL was still one of the best in the NFL back then, I dunno why Cowboys fans pretend like they weren't.  I mean are they younger now, sure, but as it pertains to the 2015 season, I don't see how that makes them SOO much better.

Barber/Jones/Choice vs McFadden/Randle/Dunbar....really man?  Really?

&gt;Not really - Choice is more of the Dunbar, I would think. Smaller, quicker.

Was totally not my point at all.  To think he can just step up into a bigger role when he never has, to just assume he'll do it np, its unfounded.  It's just hope at best?

He went from being ranked &gt;100 in TEs to being in the top ten after the years you cited. It's a marked difference.

So as a 2nd TE, he was no good?  I mean you are splitting hairs here, Witten was in his prime.  If you are suggesting 2007-2010 Witten is the same guy as today, is being a homer dude.  I watch plenty of Cowboys, you aren't talking to someone who doesn't watch the games.

I dunno, Barber and Jones had injury issues, but look at Jones' YPC when he did play.  Barber was a beast and very hard to bring down.  I don't think I'm overstating it at all bro, so we'll have to agree to disagree.  If you offered me 2008 Marion Barber vs 2015 DMC, it's a no brainer to me.  2009 Felix vs 2015 Randle, no brainer to me...



"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, I'm sure it's very common that guys are working out with guys from other teams and get traded to the team of the guy they are working out with

TIL"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously man, if you have a gaming console, just buy Madden.

It will be an interactive, practical and applied way to learn about the basics of coverages, routes, plays, players etc"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's always been important, back in Irvin's day they didn't throw flags for any little things tho like today.

Kind of like in the NBA back in Jordan's day they didn't call fouls like they do today."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"If he's gonna wait a year, his career is over.

Be really sad if he is actually innocent of anything, his whole life and future changed dramatically in 3 days.

If he is guilty, divine justice I guess"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm hoping for Rowe or AJ Cann, Fisher is still there but I think he's scooped up pretty fast now.

I agree, we will have to trade up for Rowe probably

I'm not crazy about Jaylen Collins

Buccs have some interesting choices with DGB, Fisher and Gregory"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Kicking one of them inside?

Heck we were talking of drafting Fisher and kicking him inside until Peters retires, move Lane out to LT and Fisher to RT."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So nothing then....

Can I ask you, how does it feel to be made to look like *such* an ass?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ohh, can't you mouth breathers come up with anything more original than this?

It couldn't be that they actually cheated, it's everyone hates them, that's what it is.  Everyone is bitter over some loss, or mad about something, rogue ball boys and rogue cameramen.....where does it end with this nonsense lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ya, he proposed them so he could start cheating..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Wow...that really is hard to believe with Lovie being a defensive coach.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's not all about skill when it comes to contract leverage.  It's about what the market is set at.

Are those three rated above Tanny?  For sure.  Are their agents gonna use the most recent, young QB contracts to point to in negotiation?  You bet your ass they will.

""If Wilson is X better than Tanny, and Tanny got Y, then Wilson deserves Z"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously, how does that ball not come out sometimes on him.

His mitts must be huge."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Remember Joey Porter after the game, he kept referring to the refs as ""Archie Manning"" lol
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But that's one out of how many players that have gotten the tag since it's existence?  It's more an exception no?

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,2013...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Bradford is 27 right now, I imagine he'll play to about 35ish, so I'm gonna go with 6.

Tebow wins the other 2."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But why?  Why would he be more comfortable in a court of law, dragging out his reputation along with it?  

They did tell Brady that they would have all respect for his personal data, and anything with the phone would be done in front of Brady and his lawyer....in a court of law, he would get no such guarantees, everything would be available to look at."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Feel so bad for that dude after watching that, his life literally terrorized because of one stupid mistake that most of us would probably make ourselves if in the same situation."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Kiko Alonso
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Just one link is fine man, I mean that's a start, we now at least know you are *capable of linking*, and that is impressive from you with what you've shown thus far

Now, see if you can do that with content of what you said!!!  Your getting there big guy, I'm so proud of you right now"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Really stoked to see him play in the NFL
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Was more fans of other teams, even our fanbase some saying that if Maclin leaves we should go after Cobb kinda thing.

Cobb is a perfect fit for where he is now in GB, Jordy is the multi threat prototypical ""number one"", and Cobb out of the slot doing his thing."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'd say a lot of what Watt does doesn't even show up on stat sheets
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Love Grady, great pick"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I had one kid tell me it was just that Flutie was mad he got cut from the team and hates the Patriots now lol

Boston sports here Doug Flutie, a guy who threw a pass 30 years ago that still gets shown on highlight reels today...just hates Boston so much he made all this up

I would not doubt they were messing with it, I mean too much smoke for this too.  Makes me wonder what else was buried in the ""destroyed evidence"" in 2007.

Think about it, you know the signals on defense...the 15 seconds is up, teams start to move up to the line, start moving around get get into packages etc

And Brady is getting a guy radioing to him from the booth above with a birds eye view...

And if it's going on into the play as well...well, 

""Tom, the DE just beat his man, move left in the pocket""

""Tom, Branch is wide open on the other side of the field""

Certainly would help a young 6th round QB quite a bit don't you think....


"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Just observant
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"More than Flacco or Cutler

And he also has to top Bens new deal too"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol, so sad"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He doesn't wanna play G bro, he wants to play T, he said as much earlier today

And let's be honest, it's not like there won't be around 32 teams after him, he doesn't have to settle for a G position"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I thought they should have went defense at 7, even though I really like White myself...

...but getting Goldman in the 2nd makes up for it, I thought the Bears did well"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol all the Panthers fans saying they will only draft someone LT who can start right away, don't need a RT, don't need any other OL....

But let me guess, this guy is a great pick

Whichever way the wind blows guys"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well if Emmitt says so

I wonder what Michael Irvin thinks tho...

And on that note, I'm gonna also need to know what Ja Rule thinks"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I think that's a pretty accurate list and also it's a good idea
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That penalty was called off, and the Cowboys were in the wrong on that too....I just showed you like 7 different plays bro."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Why would they?  Most of the owners seem to be on his side for this issue and the NFL's revenues and profits have grown exponentially since he's been in office....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'm pretty stoked to see Gurley play in the NFL
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"ELI5 how we got worse at QB and RB.

WR, Maclin is *better* right now than anyone we have for sure....but I explained the WR situation in a post in this comment stream."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"We'll offer Maragos

I'm kidding, we love Maragos, dude is a ST's ace, doesn't get enough credit for a lot of the good things that happened for our ST's last year

And you guys aren't gonna tag him for four years, that's silly."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"https://twitter.com/AdrianPeterson/status/604023610240446464

Yes Adrian, that's why you have a players union that negotiates a CBA....

Same power as the owners?  Well AP, when you pay $100's of millions of dollars for a football team, I'm sure that would a fair statement to make.  You decided to invest in Birthday Camels, they decided to invest in a football team...

I don't think he understands the whole employer/employee dynamic..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For sure man, just a bit early to totally write him off.  There are tons that flamed out, but I don't think he's *as bad* as he looked.  I mean he can't be right lol?

I think it was more that he just didn't realize how seriously he had to take the pro game, what he made look like childs play in college wasn't gonna fly anymore.  

Can he change and study tape, prepare properly, who knows?  "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""Is that Gregory under those bleachers, what's he doing over there?""

""*cough* *cough* be there in a second coach"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What can you do but laugh I guess

But that is a strong man, what is Jackson like 210-220, he picked him up like a toddler"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Tom Brady
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But is he so much better than anyone else in the league?  

Don't the Packers do this too, Matt Hasslebeck, Matt Flynn...

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ohh, because Eagles players made comments?  Is that what this is?  Your detective skills are lacking.

My official opinion, since 2004, has been that Andy Reid should have roped McNabb in.

There is a story, about Bill Walsh and Joe Montana.  It was a big playoff game, and Joe Cool himself was hyperventilating on the field.  Walsh called timeout, pulled Montana to the side, and calmed him down.  

That's what Reid should have done.

I'm sorry that doesn't fit with what your trying to lead to, but that's how it is."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Still nothing...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I did, you just have baseless retorts, it's boring

Byyyyeeee

And you forgot to down vote me again big guy, don't forget again, that'll show me!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's more transitioning from back peddle kind of stuff, change of direction, how fast and how fluid you are in doing it.  Some guys are just gonna be naturally more athletic and agile than other guys, but technique can take you a long way, just takes practice and hard work.

Not related to hips, but take Sherman for example.  Sherman isn't the most athletic guy, he isn't the fastest either.  He's just really smart and a real student of the game.  On the NFL Top 100 last year, they had a few players describe him, and Sherman doesn't just study his man, he studies your whole damn team.  He knows what the OC is more likely to do on 3rd and 5 and what he's more likely to do on 3rd and 10, he actually studies things like playcalling tendencies with that kind of diligence.  Ordinary and extraordinary - just that bit extra, doing the things others are unwilling to do."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Is that a unicorn?  A reasonable and objective Pats fan?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, yes, very dead, it's gonna be an awful season for us, terrible.

Yes."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh please, I started making jokes and overplaying ridiculousness *because* that bs was happening.

I've said tons of times - there are rational fans out there, but c'mon, it's like this very thread, any Pro Pats thing comes out, it's posted.  Anything, ANYTHING, with an alternate point of view, buried, down voted, slandered with mudslinging

I would try and engage in conversations, and if anything I said wasn't 100% ""Tom is great"", ""Tom is innocent"", it would be down voted like -10 within a few minutes.  I once said Corey Dillon was what made the 2004 offense go and the Pats D was a huge reason as to why they won, and was down voted to like -30 because it wasn't ""Tom did it all"", when anyone who actually watched back then knows it's completely true.

Gimme a break, like all this started just because I was making fun of the hypocrisy and ridiculousness, I've tried to have rational conversations and they always inevitably end up as ""you are a hater"", ""you are mad because of the SB 300 years ago"".  

Tell me what we should do, continue having our rational opinions buried, or at least try to have fun?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I like Gregory a lot, take this as rare praise lol.

I actually like Gregory more than Byron Jones, and keep in mind the Eagles were high on Jones too, I always maintained i would have taken Gregory over Jones.

Gregory needs to add the weight, but NFL strength and conditioning should help with that.  He'd be ideal at around 260ish, but that's a lot of weight not just to gain, but also to maintain, something Gregory has struggled with.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Yea but Hot Shots and Hot Shots Part Deux are all time classics
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea I guess having the head of league officiating on your hooker party bus can get them to fix at least *one* playoff game for you, that is something we know now.

I'm sure one day your 10 year starting QB will pass our backup QB's in playoff wins...you guys still have that guy who won OPOY after all, he should do good this year!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Smoothies
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Calling Tim average makes baby Jesus cry
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"People who know no context about anything NFL and never watched it before, it's very noticeable to them how apathetic Jay Cutler is lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol don't say it, whenever that happens the Giants win the SB

Tell Tom he's safe, it's all good, nothing to see here folks..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Can confirm, I live in Toronto, has the busiest highway in North America, but it depends on the cop.  Everyone kinda just goes with the flow, the posted limit is 100KM/h, but 90% of drivers are doing at least 120, including the cops.

But all it takes is one, been pulled over doing the same speeds I always do."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's what I think too, it's to avoid a three year deal and get a one year one as an UDFA"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I have to wonder that if he did, does BB pony up for Revis?  

It's a big price tag and very unlike him, but what does he do with all the cap space afterwards?

I think the present climate of the Pats, with Brady near the end of his career, might make him be a bit more aggressive when it comes to stuff like this maybe?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,[Who told you to put a balm on?](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Jackie_Chiles_in_The_Maestro_Seinfeld.JPG)
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, we could think a team had a terrible draft and all those players turn out amazing in 2 years.

And vice versa, a team that we thought had a fantastic one all those guys could bust.

I remember some of those Seahawks drafts people were down on them, gave them average grades, when several years later we saw that they ended up stringing together a few of the best drafts we've seen period in recent years."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I didn't insult you brah.

Basing that Bradford won't start or plays at all, when he's totally on the recovery path he's always been on, before and after the trade, based on two words in a headline is kind of silly.

Most Eagles fans have been keeping up with what's going on with all this....he is our starting QB after all....

There have been no indications that anything is not going the way it was expected to go.

Has he torn his ACL twice?  Yes, we all know that.

Guess who else did that?  Jeremy Maclin, just had the best year of his career.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Coming from a guy who probably down voted as his first order of business in the thread lol
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Agree, he can become a superstar.

Some say well he's got a bad OL and Jameis is a rookie etc....even if Jameis is half as good as expected, still better than what Evans had last year and look what he did"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That one was great actually too.

The Steve Bartman one was sad, that guys life is pretty much ruined"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Your right Pats homer, Brady is innocent!!

Keep reading NESN propaganda, it'll make more true!!!

Lol

!!!!

Oh noesss, dats strikes toooooo"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I totally am, JJ was the best

I know he won't make it, but we haven't had a decent D since he passed"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'm gonna take the action on the smoothie prop bet
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Sarah needs to get those kids the F in line like she did her husband
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Big thanks to /u/onesonesones then!

Crazy game"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't know what the other 32 team draft boards were, I know that on tape he's a bit soft to be a TE, and a bit slow to be a WR at the pro level.

Maybe I'm wrong, could be, but c'mon, you are saying:

&gt;everyone is still shocked we didn't waste a first round pick on 3rd round talent.

Yet you are defending the Funchess pick as BPA then saying you don't get paid to evaluate players?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,In before the lock
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"White *was* a beast, this year he was injured and he's past his prime as well.  White isn't that guy anymore.

YAC can have many different explanations, we can't just assume they are all broken tackles.  Like I said, he's more slippery, that doesn't mean he broke a tackle tho.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Great insight man, just great."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"PM at 8?

He had a torn quad since the Chargers primetime game, he's not number one anymore, but shoot him down to 8?  Dunno about that...it's kinda hard to step into your throws and get velocity with a torn quad.  PM has lost arm strength with age, but not as bad as it showed in like the Cincy game or Colts game."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Rhodes, Smith, Floyd, Barr, Griffin, and also adding Kendricks and Waynes?  And have one of the better defensive minds, particularly for DB,  in the game right now as HC?  

Hmmm, there was this one team a few years back, had some great drafts, HC was a DB specialist, young mobile QB....."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Here we go...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Nah I actually don't mention the actual cheating more the most part, just their hypocrisy about it"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Do you remember anyone at the time of his appointment questioning his appointment though?

Now it's like, bashfest on his credibility, bringing up that his firm did work for cigarette companies etc etc.  

Like none of the billionaire owners have been in bed with less than reputable business partners on the road to riches, I mean it's just so hypocritical."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You guys weren't splashy, but made some very nice additions, a fantastic draft, and get a motivated and angry AP back.

Also Barr as well, anxious to see him play again actually."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Just because Julio plays on a bad team, doesn't mean he's no good.

That guy is an animal dude.  Look at his stats and consider that the Falcons OL was destroyed in like Week 2 with injuries, he didn't have a LeVeon Bell as a RB, he had old man Jackson, and his surrounding cast in general outside of Ryan was pretty lackluster.

Julio is a top WR in the NFL bro, he just plays on a bad team."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's pretty meh IMO
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'm gonna go ahead and give Bradford all the credit for no specific reason at all....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea I would agree with that, when teams like the Ravens, Packers, Pats, Steelers have such consistency like they do, it's not like they are just that much better at drafting or that much luckier in the draft/FA, I think consistency like that usually points to the leadership."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"In prior years though, McCoy would still do his multiple cuts - but he would still be moving forwards.  Last year we didn't see that as much, he got a concussion early in the year that may have been a factor, and the OL being hurt...but even after the OL was back, he still had some weird games where he didn't look the same.

But again, I think it's more the attitude of doing his own thing that got Chip, can make it hard to get buy in I imagine.

Reminds of a Jimmy Johnson story - he yelled at Emmitt in practice one day in front of everyone, took Emmitt aside after, and said ""Emmitt, I had to do that, if I can yell at my superstar then there is nothing any of them can say to me when I yell at them"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ya plenty of guys get chances to start, that doesn't mean they are good.

You gave two examples of guys who were placeholders for rookies, not exactly the most glaring examples...

And they both were let go from their teams...

Mallet hasn't shown anything really
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"/u/kckolbe, it's this kind of post as to why I said he was adding nothing.

Still waiting for those Raider links dude, you seemed pretty sure of yourself...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"We ran a lot of sweeps and shotgun powers last year that were unsuccessful.  

The OL was hurt for a bit throughout the year, but as the season wore on and a lot of them got healthy again, we would still be very hit and miss on them, then you would notice holes would open up and McCoy was choosing not to hit them, and trying to get further outside too much...now it's great if he gets a home run on those, but last year he didn't as much, and would often end up with negative yardage or a very minimal gain as a result (half of McCoy's runs went for 2 yards or less)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"2012 was a great draft class for us off the top of my head.

We hit on our first five picks (Cox, Kendricks, Curry, Foles, Boykin) and also got Bryce Brown for the 7th we got for Asante Samuel, Brown was flipped for a 4th, which became a 2016 3rd.....that 7th is the little engine that could.

I dunno if I'd say ""dominate"", but it was a good draft.  Especially since our entire 2011 draft was a total bust except for our 6th rounder (Kelce).

2002 was decent too, Lito, Michael Lewis, Sheldon Brown, Westbrook were our first 4 picks."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The source is NESN, both sources were...

Lol how are you trying to twist this that it's Goodell lol

They are both Boston media based"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And how many of those because he didn't get his head around...doesn't change my point, I wasn't stating the quantity of his PI's, more the quality and reason.

Redskins 2 ranks up there with Packers and Cowboys 2 easily.

I remember a study from Sheil on Birds 24/7 from earlier in the season, tried to find the link but couldn't, was from about Week 11ish IIRC, and Fletcher lead the league in deflected passes, but he was also super high on targets too, so you gotta take context to rankings for CB's.  PFF sometimes doesn't do that."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Julio doesn't have upside, he's there"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You keep on believing they are.... They aren't... Your just being a foolish homer 

""Remember"" that"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Count your blessings before some batteries start randomly flying
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Interesting...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Would love for the Pats to take Ajayi, and I think with his slew of upcoming picks BB will take him even with the injury concern.

I mainly just want the Cowboys to get screwed for waiting on a RB :)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm thinking Dez should be suspended and the Cowboys lose their 1st round pick

Like immediately "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I just don't get the narrative of ""we didn't cheat"".

Yes, yes they did.  Circumventing the rulebook - cheating."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well, we didn't sign a FB....."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Lol Shaq in Orlando was very popular guy around 1992-1995
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The NFL clearly said the draft picks and the fine were weighted for the factor of being repeat offenders.

This isn't a court of law, this is what most people don't get.  Brady works for a union, which has a deal with the league, and that agreements states players and teams are subject to the rules and punishments of the league.

They don't need smoking guns like murder weapons in murder cases."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Even if we got Gore and still had Polk/Sproles?

I know what Chip said about wanting to add two backs etc, but there was always the draft as well, and if we re-sign Maclin we don't have to take a WR in the 1st, we could have taken a DB maybe, then we wouldn't have had to take a DB in the 2nd and maybe took a RB there?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I dunno, you have a point there for sure, but at what point to you look at a very young roster full of potential and say F this distraction?

And that might very well be the strategy AP/Dogra are going for here

Also the timing of it all, teams getting together for the first time this offseason...

Again not saying this is for sure, just a theory"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I guess they'll just have to play the games then
ImTheOnlyChipHere,This is by far the stupidest one out there the bottom of the barrel mouth breathers have come up with.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He'd fit right in wouldn't he
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""According to Greg Bedard""

translation:

""according to longtime Boston sports reporter Greg Bedard as told by the Patriots when they were mad""

I'm just dying to know what Tom Curran thinks too..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's just a double edged sword, like when Sheard was signed people were acting like they just unearthed a diamond.  Heck, I had a conversation with a guy on here showing him that Sheard was more productive as an OLB vs a DE, and he just wouldn't relent (his original point was that Sheards production dropped because of the switch to OLB, he changed his POV like 6 times throughout the convo), even though he had nothing to back it up other than ""he's on the Patriots now, so he's better"".

Why doesn't this apply to Arrington?

Not saying it's all the Pats fans, but it is many.

It's like the Eagles signing Brad Jones, Brad Jones sucked in GB, and he'll probably continue to suck here too.  Just because he signed here and it's arguable our Front 7 is better than GB's, doesn't mean Jones now gets like a +10 LB skill just from switching jerseys."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What player doesn't man?  Couldn't we find a way to criticize Aaron Rodgers when he goes 23 for 30 passing and say he left yards on the field with his missed throws?

I mean seriously, the Bears game?  Murray was like the entire offense that game, there was a string of plays inside of that game were in was Murray like 10 times in row via passes and runs.  Can't nitpick him for one play in a game where he had 228 yards on 41 touches....I mean seriously, in that game I was asking why the hell he was even still out there, they had the game well in hand already."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"LaRon Landry has never used PED's, just a smear job.

It's completely natural for a human body to look like that.

I resent that any of those USC teams were juiced...all natural...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And both of those *linemen*, will be manhandled by defensive *lineman* Fletcher Cox, and *linebackermen* Alonso, Graham, Curry and Barwin.

:)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's high risk high reward.

There is a reason why Gregory dropped, it wasn't just the weed.  But that being said, the guy is a very talented football player."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why wouldn't Jordan Matthews be high (if you were in a ranking sense here), guy had a pretty good rookie season all things considered...

Personally I think as time passes, Evans will be the best guy of the whole group, the superstar."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Wait, I wonder if this means they'll shut down Grantland?

To be honest, I could live without Simmons articles, he's kinda funny, but Barnwell is what keeps me coming back"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You didn't answer my question.

I'm not saying they rush 5 every down, but i did ask you a question which you avoided"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You kidding?

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, because McFadden doesn't exist?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I posted a thread the other day about this years first, but I included the addendum that the 1st round has roughly a 40% bust rate.

Here are some the links for some of the data I drew it from, maybe it might help with what you are doing:

http://walterfootball.com/nfldraftology408_1.php

http://www.clevelandfrowns.com/2012/05/on-the-bust-rate-of-first-and-second-round-nfl-draft-picks/

http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2012/05/01/the-chance-of-a-bust-in-the-nfl-draft

I think scoring in the draft is more about knowing what you want in players, whether it be physical attributes, character, intelligence etc, rather than getting picks in particular rounds.  Of course this has to be combined with diligent scouting as well.  

Take like the Seahawks and Carroll who is a DB wizard who most likely knows exactly what he wants as a physical prototype from players, they knew they wanted bigger, more physical DB's, that is what they were after, that's the mold they wanted to fit.  They plucked Browner from the CFL, Sherman in the 5th, Maxwell in the 6th, Chancellor in the 5th, but also got Thomas in the 1st...

That of course doesn't mean you'll never miss, but it certainly will up your percentages."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,OP where are you going and what is the provider?  Bell?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Can be a bad influence on other players.

McCoy was coached and encouraged to follow the blockers and hit the hole.  Quite often last year, he wouldn't do that, a hole would open up, but he wouldn't take it because he is always looking for that home run hole.  Which yea, is gonna pay off sometimes, but sometimes you just take your 3-4 yards and move on to the next down, quite often this would result in 0 yards or less when he did this.

Now if the other players see Chip telling McCoy this, and McCoy just doesn't do it, or even worse voices as much that he is deliberately not doing it on purpose, what message does it send to the rest of the team, especially the young guys?

DeSean would just say it right too Chip in front of everyone that he didn't want to do it that way, or that he thought his way was better.

As a leader, especially as a new leader, you can't accept that."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not equates no, but correlates yes"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol, nice"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Please, you guys down vote anything at all.

Pats fan calling someone whiney, that's rich"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Really hanging onto this HC thing... I guess disregarding Wades effect on d will do that 

He's the same qb, they just run the ball more.. You have a lot to learn about your own team bud"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, only thing I think you could say for sure is he's probably gonna go away from the heavy Cover 1's with no Revis/Talib on the team"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He's so underrated right now, I almost want the Texans to get a decent QB so he can get more recognized for how good he is"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Link? 

Also, way to add to conversation and totally make it about something it's not."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And sometimes it's paid off for him big time like with Moss, Blount and Talib, and sometimes it hasn't like with Haynesworth, Hernandez, Ocho etc.

Can go beyond arrested, certainly guys like Moss or Ocho have had disruptive character concerns before BB decided to add them"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So, not gonna come up with anything to backup your statement then?

I will accept one link at this point, big guy you can go write a bleacher report article and I'd accept that at this point you've painted yourself into such a corner here.

Write it on a napkin and put it on instragram, I'll accept that, I'm embarrassed for you now."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Apparently for all the talk of being improved and working on his throwing motion for over a year, he didn't look good yesterday and his motion is still mega slow.

But reports are he still has Jesus in the clutch"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Great hips tho man
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh it does I agree man, but going by what Lurie said in his interview at the league meetings, he gave Chip full control for a reason, he wants Chip to carry out his vision.

Didn't sound at all like ""this year or bust"", and this is from a guy that before the 2012 season, it was pretty damn clear in Lurie's message via the media that this was Andy's last shot, he pulled no punches making that clearly known."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, we wanted him to be a deep cover S, which he is not.  You guys had Revis, which allowed Chung to be played in the box.

BB can play C2 and keep him more shallow, but then what, let Chung cover the backend?

We played C1 and C3, and that's why Fletcher was burned so much.

Equating him and Chung with a simplistic value of just what teams were involved in silly, not saying you are doing this, but many did.  It just shows an ignorance of the understandings of how scheme works."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Eli Harold, we missed him by 5 picks and was watching him fall the whole time.

We brought him in and everything.

However we spent two 5th's moving up for Rowe in the 2nd already, so we didn't have an arsenal of picks to play with.

I remember I felt the same way about Navarro Bowman a few years back, but bypassed him (damn you Andy and your disdain for LB's)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's unknown right now where Rowe will play, but Boykin won't be playing on the outside most likely.

Even in Fletchers darkest times last year, and Boykin angling to play outside since last offseason, Chip and Billy Davis would not stick him outside.

Thurmond maybe, but it's unknown who is gonna be CB2 and who is gonna be the second S.

But nice work man"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol annnnnnd he down voted me

Get over yourself man, we laugh because you guys take yourselves so seriously"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He doesn't know the guys name but he's sending text messages to him using his name?

Uh huh..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No I've just watched him his whole career.

Sometimes he'll have 30 yard games, and sometimes he'll have 150.

When you cumulate everything, whats the difference?

And fantasy doesn't prove anything really.

Can anyone actually give real reasons as to why teams would account for other guys more than than they would DeSean?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Ted Wells had done work for Philip Morris more than 10 years ago...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I actually watched this video earlier today lol

I hope this helps Lane a lot, I dunno whether to be concerned or excited with how many times Lane mentioned the phrase ""more violent"" lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,That was a crazy game
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Honestly bro, I thought this before he made that comment last week about trading the 2016 1st rounder since he got Collins and Gregory AND Jones, I dunno, just seems like such a Jerry move.

Not to mention, think of the Romo interview on Kimmell, about his window closing, Jerry's ""window"" closing too....

I think JJ will do the 1st man.  Vikings reportedly wanted two firsts, thats speculation nothing hard to that, but after getting those 3 guys, considering one he didn't even have to spend a pick on either, I think he's gonna do it.

He's not gonna waste one of Romo's last few good years, Wittens too for that matter, with McFadden IMO."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'd love to get into this with you and you bring up some great points, [but I gotta workout right now](https://i.imgflip.com/ljl9b.jpg)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Watt easily.  If he continues what he's doing, he's in the mix for at minimum Top 3 GOAT defensive player, and maybe GOAT period.  

He's that dominant."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Not so much defending him as much as Underoo-burgalar has no room to talk
ImTheOnlyChipHere,And that was the day we found out Greg Hardy's reddit username
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Of course not, but let's not overblow every signing into ""it's gonna turn out like Moss"".  

And a lot of Pats fans do this.  Be excited, np, but in reality, not everything he has ever touched has turned to gold.  And when Pats fans come in and say this kind of stuff in like /r/nfl vs /r/Patriots, and are shocked when they are rebuffed, then use the Moss example as if every signing BB has ever made turned out like Moss, it's just silly man."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I know it's all the buzz to say our line is old, but Kelce was just drafted in 2011 dude and is locked up for a long time....he's not retiring anytime soon, let's try and do some research before we make posts...

Herremans was cut in February....."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"FOR WHAT?

""insane legal team"", you guys don't think the NFL has it's own ""insane legal team""....I mean really, are we power ranking labor lawyers now?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"In the present climate yes, I agree"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They would be absolutely retarded to take this to an official court.

And I don't even think they can as per the CBA, maybe defamation, but that is a whole other road.  Everyone is up on this lawyer Brady hired, forgetting that Goodell and Wells themselves are lawyers, and you don't think the NFL themselves, this multi billion dollar enterprise, has ace fucking lawyers?

You don't think that the other 31 owners would apply pressure to Kraft to not do it?

And like I was trying to show him and like you said, that phone is the first thing that comes out, and it won't be safeguarded like they initially offered.  Everything is up for grabs to go through in official court.

These guys read what the boston media feeds them then regurgitate it here, actual cognitive thinking not required."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The majority are tho, but still reasonable Pats fans out there for sure."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,The three years left on his contract
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Because you can say that Murray can achieve the same YPC as Randle with one hand tied behind his back
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol no agenda or anything combining your two posts there

Sounds like something a sane, impartial person willing to listen to both sides would do.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"As many have mentioned, Favre on the Vikings probably takes the cake.

Another one might be Kurt Warner back in the SB"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,The Bills hands down
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, Redskins WR DeSean Jackson

Lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I really don't care, i don't have a theory, I told you my answer, it's not gonna change....I'm sorry your poorly planned little ruse didn't have payoff for you

And I'm sorry that I exposed you as a fake, but it is what it is now.

You gonna stay butthurt or are you gonna move on, I've got some NBA to watch and probably gonna go look for more stimulating convos to have on here while I wait for the game to start mmmmk

Sorry about your butt hurt, pick yourself up and move on "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Goodell has it out for the Patriots, this is know by the fact that Goodell goes to dinner at Robert Kraft's house regularly, including the day before the AFCC

He hates them so much!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's so like, ""Call Saul"" this ""we'll take him to court."" over anything and everything.

For what?

Is it not understood that there is a CBA here...

It's like I saw another post in here the other day, a Pats fan was going on and on about how Goodell better reverse everything because he's about to go to jail for contempt of court in the AP thing....yes, jail.....
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Why for Parker and Dorsett?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I hate the new format for watching videos, I rarely go there anymore because of it"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It is, but Mathis and Peters still have 2 years minimum left.  Both are 33.  Mathis is a possible cap casualty at the end of the year worst case.

I would have liked some OL, some depth at the very least, but it's not like we need them to start right away.  We still have the top rated LT and top rated RT in the NFL, #2 ranked guard and a top rated center.  RG we have guys, looks like they are gonna get their shot."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dez

Julio

Calvin

Jordy

DeSean"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Look at Kaep's and Dalton's guarantees, they are 30% of what Tanny's are.

Kaep's been to two NFCC, and Dalton has made the playoffs every year his career.

He now has one of the higher guarantees in the whole league.  If he gets hurt, he's got all that for sure.  "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I've clearly said several times that he's not just a sack guy.

Maybe you should re-read before going off on a holier than thou?

And maybe you should realize that I have never suggested Houston is not a good player, at all.  This is the narrow minded view, that because Wilkerson is good that means Houston is bad.

Am I not saying it's a fair trade?  What exactly did you miss here?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'd just like to see the guy get his life together and play, he's a pretty talented guy."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Yikes
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Care to explain why the Pats were punished for it? 
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't remember, I remember the last Cowboys game from 2008, but not that one..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Most of the parents of Pats fans on /r/patriots2 set them down for a nap after school?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm not doubting Houston, I love Houston, just because I made that statement doesn't suggest I'm saying Houston can't do those things, never said that at all.

I'm saying by and large, most people look at sacks to determine the worth of a DL/OLB.  Which is silly.

It's like people saying Houston is better than Watt because he had one more sack....it's so narrow viewed."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt; Also lot of coaches value team culture and want players with high character over freak athletes that can have problems off the field. That's what the Patriots have been doing and that's why they are so good

That statement, and this post you just made, totally don't add up.

Hate when people bring up Hernandez?  I'm sure no one knew he was gonna end up murdering someone, but Hernandez had tons of character concerns before being drafted.

I think you are painting this whole thing with a bit of a homer brush bro.  Like man2010 said, tons of teams take risks with these guys, the Pats aren't some pioneer for it, teams have been doing this long before BB was the HC of the Patriots, and doing it while he was too.

And teams have long been doing the opposite too, only taking high character guys, the Pats didn't blaze some trail for this either."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's the guarantee too though bro, that's a really high guarantee in comparison to say Kaep and Dalton."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,http://i.imgur.com/cZyM2hL.gif
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Bradford trade happened right at the start of Free Agency, Tuesday at 4pm.

All of those offers were made on the preceding weekend."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Because nitpicking makes this comment stream not valid.

Typical lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's not about sacks for Watt, it's stilly to think he's just a sack man.  He does so much more.

No disrespect to LT or Reggie, but Watt is on that level.

People think too much that it's all about sacks and thats it."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ah ok, I thought you might have saw something like how Byron Jones' tape as a press CB is super underwhelming against inferior competition no less...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I felt like he went away from that last year a lot.  Went down by arm tackles a lot, led the league in negative yardage, and didn't see him moving forward while juking as much.

2013, guy was nuts with it.  Forget if it's from that year, but that insane jump cut against Carolina, didn't see him do stuff like that last year."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""Anything""  
""We are going here""  
""Oh I don't want to eat that"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"To be fair, in your first paragraph, couldn't we replace the word ""NFL"", with the word ""Patriots"" and still be able to support it with debate?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt; but I think the defense needs a season or two to get things figured out.

Just to be fair to that, John Fox does have a history of turning a defense around rather fast.  Granted he had Julius Peppers and Von Miller added to the respective teams in the other instances, very unique players.

The Bears defense gave some pretty uninspired performances the last two years, but I wonder, how much of their play was in fact just that, inspiration?

Carolina was last in points allowed in 2001, Fox brought them to be one of the top defenses in the league in his first year there.  Denver was one of the worst defenses in the NFL in 2010, Fox brought them to middle of the pack within a season.
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Part of it I think is he pretty much does everything for them.  He's the GM, he's the HC, they don't have many scouts, and there are other things he does too beyond HC IIRC.  A Bengals fan made a very informative post on it awhile back.

Then consider the other coaches with full power (GM and HC), BB and Chip Kelly, I think they are the only other two, both of them still have a bit more sound infrastructures to help them out.

Then add in, Marvin Lewis, even after 10 years in his role, is getting $4.5 M (19th highest paid coach), BB is getting $7.5M, and Kelly is getting $7M (and Kelly didn't even have GM powers when he got his deal).

Mike Brown is notoriously cheap, hard to say whether he could find another guy to do all the things Lewis does for less than average pay, and still make the playoffs consistently (in a division with consistent contenders like the Steelers/Ravens no less)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No RB though...Ajayi is still around, heard he has an injury concern, and could also maybe see the Pats picking him up with one of their many picks coming up too.

Do you guys feel AP is still in play for 2016 picks, maybe Jerry finds the key to the cuffs and makes a phone call?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Of course he doesn't, but La'el said after the draft he wanted to play T *before* he signed with the Cowboys, or met with Jones or any of that.

I mean this wasn't really your typical rookie situation tho, it kind of had your typical Free Agency thing where he got to pick his team.

Like I said, it's still to early, I figured he'd get a shot at taking Free's spot though."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Nah Mathews came later
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I thought that was supposed to be the omen that we were getting Mariota?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dude c'mon, he played with Moss for two years...

Brady for the majority of his career has been dink and dunk whether it be Weis or McDaniels, he's played for 14 seasons, not 2."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But those were the years they had Barber/Jones/Choice...the problem was they would never stay dicisipined to run the ball as much as they did last year.

Crayton was a pretty good slot man IMO. 

Davis and Flozell were older, but they were still good outside of Flozell's false starts.

Gurode was a top level center easily.

Just saying, it's not like ""Romo's had it bad until now"".

Barber/Jones/Choice was a pretty damn good trio of three different styles too.

And in the context of the Randle conversation too, Choice was pretty good as a spell back too, he was the only one to rush over 100 against that all time Steelers D, but he wasn't a feature back either."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Why is he biased?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You could have taken literally any game at all, and you pick a game where PM is terrible and playing with an injury that has a direct effect on throwing ability and motion.

Your questions comes across as ""who was worse is their most recent playoff loss, TB or PM....yea, it's PM bitches, you betta believe it...

I mean you are attempting to equate an injury which effects whether a QB can step into his throws to quality of WR....you know that's silly or you wouldn't have deleted all the posts


You could have taken any QB and any game at all, and you chose one where he was injured"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'm not gonna comb through all the threads c'mon lol
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Lol that's bs and you know it
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I honestly don't know how to feel about that one, one one hand a lot of DB's are taught to play the WR's hands first, so I understand how that becomes habit, especially got CB's that play trail technique.

On the other hand, some of the PI's from Bradley Fletcher and Cary Williams last year, were simply because they didn't flip their head around, and they had time, they could have, they just didn't, and honestly, we deserved to get those PI's."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think most talk up Minnesota for like 1-3 years from now because of a ton of great young talent.

For 2015, it's still very much GB's division to lose IMO

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea those damn McCoy fumbles, good thing we got rid of him"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dez, he's the best WR in the NFL IMO

And Witten, not only is he a great player but he's also a good guy"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Isn't Edelman better than Welker?  Or have I been led down the wrong trail here...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Defamation wouldn't reduce any suspension though, and would be to to try and reclaim some dignity in regards to his legacy if anything.

And I doubt Kraft (or rather, the other owners pressuring Kraft) would approve of him suing the league for defamation.  It would set a bad precedence for future disciplinary issues with players wouldn't it?  

Has any active player ever sued the league for defamation?

I just think it's silly how some will throw out the court thing like it's a personal injury 1 800 lawsuit, ""just take them to court""!!!....but not actually thinking out what it would be for, and not taking into account that there is a CBA that states punishment is dealt with internally....

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Heck dude, look at the reaction to the LS.

40MPH!!!!  Like anyone had ever given any thought ever to how fast a LS snaps a ball before NESN or whoever brought it up lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's a good point man, probably is something that is overlooked, I would imagine is does effect him while adrenaline is flying in a very physically exerting game too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That there is very little belief in Bradford.

I think it's a result of us being pumped for Mariota for a year, but of course with the mandatory *if he stays healthy*, the guy is actually a pretty good QB.

If you look at some of the video, he's being attacked almost instantly.  Someone in /r/eagles posted a vid from his rookie year, and he literally snaps the ball, and immediate pressure.  There was one where he's throwing one of those quick throws, like a WR bubble screen throw, like less than half a second the DL is in the backfield.

Is he gonna be great?  Who knows...

But he's not a bust (this far).

Got dealt a bad hand so far?  Arguable."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I watched more of him lately for obvious reasons, and his footwork is so much better than any QB we've had of late, not just Foles but Vick and Kolb as well.

Just an objective question, do you think part of his footwork issues in St Louis maybe was because of a lackluster OL?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Aw, that one stopped you in your tracks didn't it..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Hasn't he also had a ton of concussions
ImTheOnlyChipHere,One season....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,GOAT LS
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'm just saying the distribution of carries has to be telling a least a little bit of the Cowboys coaching staff's opinion on Randle and the rest of them when they give Murray almost 500 total touches and give them like 70....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"TIL Romo making retarded checks at the line was costing the Cowboys games....see Vikings playoff game 2009, Packers reg season 2013 etc etc

TIL Jason Garrett saying year after year ""we have to run the ball more""  ""we are gonna run the ball more"" then Romo checking out of said runs all the time

I said numbers...not some banal homer commentary "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,The deflecting is strong with these ones
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Philadelphia Traders
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes we all read that letter, not just you.

Ask yourself - you don't think the NFL had lawyers approve this whole process?

Brady's lawyer sent that out - and Goodell still refused to recuse himself as arbitrator - do you think the NFL is just stupid and didn't read that part?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"C'mon dude, this kid is from Oregon and has a fucked up knee

If Chip Kelly didn't take him, something must be very wrong"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For a co-ordinator or HC, sure, absolutely, that is their job.

For a player, I don't think it's as common to be *that* in depth.  I think Sherman just takes it that extra mile is what I've read, and Revis is the same as well, a lot of study that other players might not do.

Think of Brady and Manning vs other QB's, we've heard it from many different players, great ones like Ray Lewis, what separates those two guys from others, is all the extra work they do studying opponents in many different facets. Manning's teammates used to call Manning ""the caveman"" in college because he spent so much time holed up watching tape and studying.  Heck even Lewis himself is a great example of behavior like this.  Ray Lewis said that for Manning and Brady, he used to put their cadences on an audio tape, and listen to them on the plane with is eyes closed to get a feel for when they were gonna snap the ball, when they were done checking and adjusting, so Rex's ""amoeba"" looks might be more effective....it's that kinda stuff that all players just don't do.

They played it in practice yes, having Browner helped on that play as well and his intel on the Seattle O, both Butler and Browner said as much.  

With Seattle it's a bit different, because they aren't changing their defense a ton, they aren't mixing up the play calls a ton....they are coming out in Cover 3 most of the time.  If it were just as cut and dry as the team is laying it all out for them, then Browner or Maxwell would be just as good wouldn't they?

This is not really what BB meant by situational football.  BB means a lot further than simple down and distance stuff, more about like be conscious of the clock, be concisous of the sticks, be conscious of where you are for field position like the example he gives to the one guy, if it's an offside down inside 2 yards, be patient, if they aren't they lose an inch, if you are they get 5 yards...so be patient...that's more what BB is after with his situational football talk.

I don't think it's as common from players to know and study it that in depth.  I mean like I said, Sherman isn't terribly athletic and he's isn't terribly fast either, it's his study that gives him the big edge, puts himself in positions to succeed.

Not all players are gonna know that say, on 3rd down the Eagles run hitches when in 3rd and 5, and they run outs on 3rd and 10 more often.  This is going to effect how say Sherman plays that in backpedal, when does he flip into his transition ""T"" etc."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Byron Jones is one for me, and not just because of the Cowboys or anything, I was never really high on him and had said many times in /r/eagles.

Athletic freak for sure, great kid, a leader.

His tape as a press CB though...underwhelming.  Saw E Carolina and UCF I think it was on a breakdown.   

He seemed to get pushed around a bit defending the run too even though he had no bones about getting in there.

I could be totally wrong, but in terms of physical freaks, rather it be like a pass rusher to take a risk on over a CB, such an instinctive and mental position.

I went into watching him excited to see but after it was done I was pretty let down TBH."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I know, don't tell the Panthers fans that though."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,JustLogicalThings
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't know tons about Harmon myself, I see Pats fans are pretty mixed on him

I think the concern for C2, Tampa style, is the MLB plays such a big role.  Will Mayo be the same guy coming off a pretty serious injury that can limit mobility and agility, especially when you are pushing 30.  It's something I'm sure BB is considering

Fletcher is not bad at those lower zones, so C2 might be a bit better for him specifically.  It's vertically where he's a real liability."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"http://imgur.com/gallery/97BYY8r

And Tyron does one of his trademark holds on it to boot as well

By that amazing pass rushing talent, 3rd string ILB Casey Matthews, beats Tyron Smith off the edge....

So by the one gif logic - Casey Matthews &gt; Tyron Smith"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dude just tell him Tom Brady is awesome and Peyton Manning sucks

That's all he obviously wants to hear here and is the only reason he created this bizarre thread."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why is it ridiculous?  He's the Commissioner and this is typically how things have went in the past...

If there is an issue at your work who would usually preside over a resolution?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No way man, he was just used wrong, he's gonna be amazing with the Eaglez cuz we'z da bestest!!!  Packers just didn't know how to use him, we will though, magically.

Did i do it right Pats fans?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea that is my bad actually, Ravens deserve to be up there for sure, I really like Mosley a lot."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not the best games to compare since PM had a torn quad and Brady did not.

Depends on the situation, QB pressures etc

Foles had a ton of overthrows last year, led the league I believe in overthrown deep balls, but to be fair to him, he was under a lot of pressure while most of the starting OL was out."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,How much you guys paying Brandon Carr this year again?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Love that trade for the Jets, but Rivers is a QB, and a damn good one.

Even with his age, the Jets would most likely be the one sending the picks.  And I don't doubt Wilk for a second, it's just QB's are QB's

Can't forget that Wilkerson is also due a giant contract as well, that also plays into value."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not 100% either now that you bring it up to be honest, I remember this from way back when he first became commish, so 10 years time may have blurred it, you may be right too lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I am, and the two highest paid defenders in the past bit have been DL.  Haynesworth and Suh.

And again, what about Peppers?  He was elite in 2009, no doubt about it.

What is the reason? Dan Snyder is crazy?

Dude, Haynesworth was a fucking force in 08, they went 13-3 and he was the centerpiece.  Dude was absolutely dominant.  Haynesworth's contract is seen as stupid because he stopped trying, because he gave up.  No one in 2009 thought that would happen, he was considered to probably be the best defensive player or at least one of the, in the league after 2008, lets not rewrite history because it didn't work out here."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,What an elegant and thoughtful response
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"To be fair, and this is the truth, try typing in Safari bro.  It's God awful, changes words all the time.

And it's the internet, it's reddit, forgive me if I don't give a shit to spell check it like I'm submitting to my boss or something.

Honestly, criticize my spelling and grammar, I don't care.  Safari is responsible for at least 80% of it."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think we might cut Carroll now, I mean, he only got on the field in dime packages.

He's $3M with no dead money.

And we now have Maxwell, Thurmond, Boykin, Rowe (could be S tho), Watkins (could be S tho), Biggers, Shepherd, Evans....

There isn't really a need for us to be carrying 9 corners, and even if we move Rowe or Watkins to S and make it 8 CB's, we still have Reynolds, Wolff and Couplin for depth.

Let's just hope that out of the 8 of them (not including Maxwell), someone can be viable on the outside lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,If you do the crime you gotta be ready to do the time man.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't think you lead the NFL is catches for so many years by accident, Welker's route running was amazing."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"After Kraft's statement the other day....you think that Brady would take the NFL to court for defamation, near the end of his career no less?

You realize that Brady's phone comes out in a defamation suit?

How does a defamation suit reduce Brady's suspension?

You realize that he hired a labor lawyer - why would he do that for a defamation suit?  Isn't that like signing Sheard to play S?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously dude, that one pass, yes that pass probably seals the game for the Pats, I get it, but this guy was a friggin machine.  And he's just being remembered for that one drop.

Gronk is a machine for sure, he's the best TE in football right now.  Healthy Graham can give him a go, but Graham can't block like Gronk.

I just think it's really silly to downplay what Welker meant to that offense, or how important he was to the 2007 offense as well.  It's being re-written like is was all just Brady-Moss.

I honestly don't blame him for leaving either, Patriots had preached taking less etc...then went and made trades for highly paid Ocho and Haynesworth...it's like Wilfork being pissed over them signing Revis."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'd rather keep Tebow than draft Hundley

I don't understand how some of our fan base thought it would be smart to take him as early as the 1st or 2nd...he can't read defenses..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Saying what?

I don't recall Bryce Brown saying McCoy left too much ""meat on the bone"" for his liking.....

Got any links?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They don't play different positions?

I think you are confusing the comparison of 3-4 OLB and 4-3 DE.

They play completely different positions.

Again, just because I'm saying Wilk is really good, doesn't mean I'm saying Houston is bad.

I'm saying most people gauge a players worth on sacks.  We've seen it in this thread already "" he had 22 sacks, thats why"".  I know Houston does more than that, I know he drops into cov, I'm not downplaying Houston jesus."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,&gt;Can no one answer what they would be going to court for?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Broncos or Colts would have to be up there

Jets too if Harris, Revis and Cromartie, Fergueson are all in their prime, QB still an issue though"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Yikes Chargers....maybe Gordon's situation isn't really all that much better than Gurley's when it comes to fantasy after all..
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But at this point, in May, you guys and everyone else was very much under the impression that Flynn was the starter right?

I know the story about how Wilson blew everyone away and beat him out in camp, just saying its May, with stuff like this, this by no means is an indication that Manziel won't get the nod, I think it's just to light a fire for Manziel if anything"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Are they cable or DSL?

I mean gotta realize that a lot of these ""100Mbps"" we hear in Canada in very subjective, especially if it's cable based.  I have Rogers 100 and I can tell you it's not 100.  And I live in a big city too.

IIRC the Bell Fibe is 25Mbps max.

10 should be ok as long as you buffer the stream in adobe setting, which is pretty easy to do.

What you should investigate in whether they have a bandwidth cap, some of those streams can add up fast depending on the quality."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Mark Sanchez - chicken tender wrap
ImTheOnlyChipHere,And that he had a lifelong dream to be a fireman.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dorsett is gonna surprise I think.  He's in the best situation and I think there is a bit of a misconception out there that because the Colts pick of him was ridiculed, that it was ridiculed because he wasn't good.

It was ridiculed because they had other issues to take care of, and WR wasn't exactly a weakness *this* season (obviously Andre is at the end of his run and TY is a FA after this year looking forward).  

Cooper is still the best of the bunch, and White probably has the most superstar potential, but for this year I'd go with Dorsett."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think that is the big problem at the beginning for sure, my GF and many friends kept telling me to watch, and finally I did, and there are so many characters being introduced at the beginning it's hard to keep track of who is who.

But even the smallest thing in like season 1, will effect something way later in season 4 or something, that's beauty of the show, you have to pay attention to everything.

Reminds of the Wire in that way."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Off topic here, who do you want Towns or Okafor"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not I sir, said this same exact thing many times in /r/eagles before the draft.

Never said he was a bad athlete, said he's underwhelming as a press CB."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"In the context of this conversation tho, it's about a defamation suit.

Brady would have to give up his phone in a defamation suit"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"[You've done well grasshopper](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view8/4877184/mr-miyagi-o.gif)

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And this is also not to mention the report that Doug Flutie also accidentally put Tom Brady's helmet on once, and he heard radio communication into the helmet well past the 15 second cutoff and into the actual play as well IIRC.

People gloss over the radio communication part of it, as if they just pointed a camera in one game and that was it."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's possible to keep both if PM retires after this year, which is probably likely.

But both of them are gonna be paid elite type money without a doubt."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I agree Blackmon when he did play, was pretty good..

Joekel it is a bit early, but he hasn't been great.

Way to early on Bortles, was happy to see at least they made some OL upgrades for him, poor guy got the crap beat out of him last year.

Well on the bright side, Marks will be back at some point, and Bradley seems like he's got the mustard."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Tag for 5 years tho? It's fully guaranteed
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This question has a ton of different answers, and a ton of different variables

What sparked you to ask OP, might be able to give a better answer that way"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But this is very subjective at this point though...to say a change will cause regression is just as much as a coin toss of progression is it not?

I'm not saying I guarantee we will be better, because the fact of the matter is no one knows right now at the very best, because in many areas we have a whole new team really.

However other than RG, we haven't exactly got weaker anywhere.

And we've upgraded at QB, CB and LB without a doubt.

RB is debateable, but at worst even the most steadfast McCoy lover can't say we've gotten *weaker* to the point we will regress. Maybe if we only signed Mathews, but Mathews *and* Murray...

WR, ok, Maclin is better than any WR we have now.  However, have to take into account the Kelly offensive scheme doesn't exactly favor one WR over the other, we saw that when we went from Foles to Sanchez and all Maclin's production went over to Matthews simply because of targets.  They were still playing the same roles they always did though (Matthews in the slot mostly and Maclin outside mostly)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,*/r/patriots2 vigorously mashes report button*
ImTheOnlyChipHere,McNabb and Reid in the SB.   Andy should have reigned McNabb in.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I like him as a back, don't get me wrong, him and CJ Anderson carried me to the playoffs last year (I had the most terrible luck, my drafted RB's were AP, Moreno, Rice and Gore).

I dunno, is Marvin and company gonna split the carries?  Is he a half year wonder?  Just by where he's being slotted I mean, he's in the 2nd round in mocks right now, too early IMO.

Plus I've also been ""Steve Slaton'd"" before, I know Slaton got hurt and it's a bit diff, but I've been hurt by the one year wonder before lol.  

It's not that I don't like Hill, I just don't like him that high when I could take like Foster or Morris instead, guys who I know are solid (until Foster gets hurt anyway lol) and are gonna get the lions share of the carries.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Like I said, no matter how you feel about the subject, I think that's what he was referring to."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm not relying on that one game, I'm going off:

1. OP's post and research

2. You said 2013 OL wasn't as good as 2014

3. In the only time the coaching staff trusted him to have more than 10 carries in 2014, he again failed to get over 3.0 YPC, and this falls in line with his career pattern thus far."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"WR it's clearly not referring to I would say with Huff and Agholor being added.  Matthews is 6'3 but he hasn't been used in the ""big guy"" role, yet anyway

Again, look at the sizes of all the LB's we signed under Chip."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Doug Flutie put on Brady's helmet by accident once, and he heard all of that past the 15 second cut off. And that's Flutie saying that himself.  Boston sports hero Doug Flutie...

The Pats were messing with the frequencies and allowing themselves to do it

Makes you wonder about what else we don't know with all the destroyed evidence"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,You're not a man if Brian's Song doesn't make you shed a tear
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Its only ok if Pats fans say it, not other fan bases

This sub is being ruined right now, good convo's getting quashed by pettiness"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"LOL Patriots are clean in the earlier SB's

I wonder what team this guy supports...hmmmmm"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Or say for TE blocking or RB blocking - how does PFF know whether he's just supposed to chip, or if he's supposed to delayed block and release, or just be a static blocker?  I would think that would be pertinent information to know when considering whether they did their job blocking or not.

Like how do they determine that for 32 different teams, with roughly 130 snaps per game, in such a short period of time?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Jordan Hicks, our 3rd rounder from this year...

He's wearing #58, Trent Cole's number..

Too soon man, too soon"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Focusing on the run game more heavily was the delta between 8-8 and 12-4.

If any of those guys could even closely supplant Murray, I think they would have divided the carries up a little more evenly last year.  Garrett and Linehan aren't morons, they don't give one guy 400 carries and make him play with a broken hand, and give Randle and Dunbar like 90 carries combined and don't even trust them to start in meaningless games, not to mention still had Murray out there against the Colts most of the game when it was well in hand.

And McFadden....well, Raider fans can tell you about McFadden.

Blah, blah, blah OL, again, if it's just the OL, why did they rely on one back so heavily then?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Moreover using them when they should be, many short yardage situations we would keep them on the bench.  Heck even Leonard Weaver we sometimes wouldn't either."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Except they don't win every year...why didn't they do this to PM teams then?  They are winning by the same standard every year too.

You guys act like the Pats have won 10 straight SB's or something."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yep, totally agree"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I thought everyone on the planet hates the Patriots?

I mean that's the only reason for these trumped up cheating charges amirite guys?  

GUys??"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He said complete, not has a badass OL and one elite WR.

That's only 6 positions bro, there are 22 starters"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,No he can't read defenses for shit
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Here's a theory - is he making it easier to get traded (lessen his value)?

Just a thought.  No one wants to give a 1st....but what if they didn't have to..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Also don't forget about [this guy](http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-3a3d/k2-_029b7752-2a0c-4b91-a1e9-6a3a06e64e93.v1.jpg) and [this guy](http://s48.photobucket.com/user/loluchka/media/video_camera-1.jpg.html)

They should be getting in too all things considered"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,What else should we be projecting from?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Good chat man
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This a proper list, nice to see the 08' Steelers represented in the Top 5, they never get enough credit for some reason, that was truly an all time defense.

Toughest schedule in NFL history, and number 1 on D in a climate where the league had some very elite competition on defense with the Ravens, Giants, Eagles, Cowboys, Redskins, Patriots and Titans all fielding some pretty good D's that year."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea thats what i mean, like BMarsh, very hard to bring down, can power out of tackles even by LB's"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's guilty AF
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea kinda like Tony got all those passes for the awful late season turnovers all those **years** in a row

Let's shit on Murray for fumbles tho"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea me too, graphics aren't as important as the gameplay itself.  I was admittedly just pretty blown away by how good the PC version of Witcher 2 looked, but it's not something I would use enough to warrant dropping big coin on a badass PC.

I'm probably gonna get because the gameplay is said to be crazy good and expansive."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Fair enough, but he did have him behind these 3 even if he was doing a sequential ranking, and you could say that's fair"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He comes in on subs mostly, so yea I guess you could say that.

Our base is usually Cox-Logan-Thornton"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Wow, that guy looks like a real go-getter, we need someone like him"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Crentist
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Jerry Jones is a Pats hater
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Can you send this memo out to the Pats fan base that just because someone says Manning is great doesn't mean Brady is not, and doesn't devalue Brady or his accomplishments?

I know it's not all, but it's a lot."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,No didn't you also hear Spygate was just that one game too?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Nah, now that the offense has shifted back into Romo's hands and away from the OPOY, back to the 8-8 wasteland for the Boys.

But hey, at least you guys got that CB who can...jump really high...?  I mean he's not exactly a good CB when you watch his actual tape, but he can run fast and jump high!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Still, he said he wants to play T, I would think right away he meant."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I find against the CPU it's really hard to roll out, the DL closes at a crazy rate.  I had Mariota in a downloaded roster class, 89 speed, and DL catch him np.

I remember in M10, guys used to run backwards like 15 yards right off the snap, was really lame, is that what you mean?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"If you guys need a QB still, we got Tebow and Sanchez

:D"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,It would be remiss to have a Garcia post and not mention his hot wife.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's all about sacks man, people severely underestimate the value of 3-4 DE's because they don't rack up sack numbers

It's like Richard Seymour in the 2000's, I remember people used to say he wasn't as valuable as pass rushers, because that one year he ""only"" had 8.5 sacks.  8.5 sacks for a 5T is above average and quite damn good."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For $10 man, that's not bad."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Please, I've had football discussions, heck I just put one in another thread.

I was saying the comparison between Chung and Fletcher is unfounded and baseless, because of the schemes and the positions.  I made a pretty decent case, but because it's the Pats, down voted with no response....

It's like, why don't you just join in to convo's instead of just trying to bury things you don't understand with the only outlet you can find to do so?

So many convo's get buried on here because of pettiness."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I just like how he'll talk for like 2 minutes, but at the end of it, he's really said nothing at all lol

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I didn't make the claim that ""he was the best"", because that suggests that he did better than everyone else.

He found one QB that had one good season in 15 years outside of Brady....

How does this make his QB drafting any better than his DB/WR drafting?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"BB will still find a way to cheat anyway, don't kid yourself"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He had more than 2 bad games...and he gets stupid PI's from simply not turning his head, very easily avoided."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"After seeing that post in /r/eagles with that long and very comprehensive string of gifs of Bradford, 

[I think he's gonna do really well here....](https://i.imgflip.com/lqpdk.jpg)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's alright I guess.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"If only you would have started out with this instead man lol...

He's a great kid, and he is smart and has a great attitude too.  He brings leadership ability too.  And his athletic stuff is off the charts.  But he's got a lot of work to do as far as CB.  Personally I just see CB as such an instinctive position, very mental aspect to it, especially with the LOB rules to deal with now too.

Potential is there for sure, but he's got a road to travel for the CB aspect. Don't forget the Eagles were very high on him too, /r/eagles had many discussions on this guy, personally I always saw him as a project."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Bills, Jets, Rams, Fins are the teams in the mix.

You could honestly make an arguement for all of them, but the Rams signing Fairley gives them a bump in the depth department"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Haynesworth?

Look at Haynesworth vs Peppers, both went into FA at the same time.

Dude, Suh would have gotten paid regardless of anything.

Do you think Houston would have gotten anywhere near $60M guaranteed?  Again, not doubting Houston here, just asking.

Peppers was an elite pass rusher at the time, one of the best in the league."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"On play #6 would have liked to see him turn on the jets a bit more the moment he clears Ertz, hit it into 2nd gear.

Matthews isn't a burner but he's faster than that, especially vs a safety."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Cardinals - the John Brown pass that sealed the deal is 100% on Nate Allen, got caught flat footed

Cowboys #2 - Fletcher getting burned again and again by Dez

Redskins - Fletcher getting burned again and again by DeSean.

We were in all those games, and Sanchez actually led us back from 21 points down to take the lead against the Cowboys, he makes stupid INT's, but the secondary really let us down in those games IMO"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"*makes comment after he down votes any and every non- Pro Pats POV in the thread, even the deeply buried ones*

Aww, it's so sweet how you guys even identify him as one of you know"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Jerry is gonna pony up some 2016 picks, I can see it.

The Pats are gonna take Ajayi IMO, they have a ton of picks before the Cowboys are on the board.  After Ajayi, who is left?

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, and all the other 11 years he worked for the Giants too...

What's your point here, Pats/BB circlejerk?

If you actually watched the show, you'd see how much credit LT gives to Parcells for his career over anyone else."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I like pretzels.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Shermans teammates and there effect on how good he is is grossly overstated.

Sherman is the 2nd best CB in the NFL easily, especially if you understand how Cover 3 works."

And he might be the best 50/50 man in the league right now too.

Browns got him on the route running, but I'll take Dez for breaking tackles, 50/50 balls, hands (like showing his hands late)."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Was a joke bro, I know he's let McCloughan do his thing.

I actually like some of the stuff the Skins have done, I respect that they went with OL and tried to invest in RG3 that way.  They spent a lot to get him, and will be spending a lot even when his option $ kicks in, better to at least give him good opportunities with good protection.  I think it's underrated how the Skins have pretty good guys at the skill positions in Morris, DJax, Garcon...interested to see if Reed can step it up too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,http://i.imgur.com/mW1DKYR.gif
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Would totally agree on Jake Matthews, he had a high ankle sprain that he got early in the year.  I think he's gonna show that he's got Dad's genes and why he was drafted so high this year."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I look at it like what the Skins did with RG3, shocking they took Scherff over Williams, but maybe that was the best thing to do in the big picture, they invested so much into RG3, have pretty good skill positions, but a sub par OL to protect him.

I think Fisher would have been a solid pick, especially over a guy who is maybe too soft to play TE and too slow to play WR.

Cam is gonna be running for his life bro, and it wasn't pretty at points last year, last thing I'm sure you guys want is to see Cam injured again.

I like Shaq, seems like a great kid with a great attitude, but I think it was possible to get him in the 2nd, maybe the Packers might have taken him, big maybe though."

Welker is what made that offense go, there is a reason why Edelman followed Welker around like a puppy dog.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,12th DVOA
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's a concern for sure about the injuries, but I expect his carries to be in the 250 range rather than 400, Chip said as much already.

We do have Mathews and Sproles there to spread it out, and Murray himself said he doesn't care about number of carries, the only way he'd be upset about carries is if whoever got it didn't convert a 3rd down or something.

It's gonna be interesting to see how Chip divvies up the carries though."

I don't even care, it's internet points.  Everyone always clicks on the hidden ones anyway, it's human nature like a car wreck."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Holy moley.

Dude, no one ever said deflating footballs was a ""crime"", nor is Brady being tried in a court of law for anything."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Success: Fletcher Cox.  We don't even sniff 2nd overall in sacks without him, he opened things up for the rushers, he's a silent protector, a watchful guardian, the...

Failure - Bradley Fletcher"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Only the Pats fans properly understand, got ya

Rest of us can't read"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,What if the Eagles just gave TO the extra money he wanted?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,500 rush attempts - leash
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Dude he was the OC....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So it is an official rule?  My mistake if it is, was under the impression it wasn't"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"His statement ""bigger guys beat up little guys"", and the fact that all his signings have been taller guys.  

Like Ed M saying they never would have taken Goode...which is also weird because he said we would haven ever taken Goode like Andy did because he's 6'0, but then we take Hicks who is 6'1??"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why would Reggie White be a Packer?

Or Moss be a Patriot?

Why not make Manning a Bronco then, or Steve Smith a Raven, or Favre a Viking, or Rice a Raider, or Deion a Falcon or 49er or Redskin or Raven....

This list sucks da ballz"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Truth man, only way to get that pussy off the pedestal "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,You're forgetting all the lying and being uncooperative parts....let's not cherry pick things man
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Plus they were really banged up last year too the Falcons on the OL.  That Week 2 game they were dropping like flys.

I'm a fan of Jake Matthews myself, and the Falcons would probably be my pick too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Did you know Tony G used to play basketball too!!!
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""You know Mike, this /u/woodlickin, I like this guy, he always knows when to make the right comments at the right time, always putting himself in the right positions for up votes, he knows when to reference old HC's from his team, I call him ""Right on time"" because he's always making posts at the right times!!  This guy is probably the best poster on the whole sub!!"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I wanted Rex to take a commentator job, he would be fantastic"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Jerry Jones and Dan Snyder would be getting hand cramps from writing so many cheques?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I've seen Pats fans say it about every team, ""your just jealous because of this game""  ""your just jealous because you didn't beat us this year""....it's like, where is the cutoff for this nonsense lol

I've said it 1000 times, and on here too, Andy Reid is to blame and no one else."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'm actually not worried about Bradford.

I'm still worried about the secondary.  Quite a bit.  We got rid of some bad players, but we've only replaced one of them, and despite the fact Cary Williams is an asshole, he wasn't that bad of an actual corner outside of bad PI's.

Our secondary is what burned us out of a playoff spot, and it's still not completely fixed."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dorsett is a good player, but it is pretty insane you guys passed on Brown, then the Pats of all teams get him.

Everytime Blount and Gray are pounding the Colts next year on the run, you guys are gonna be thinking ""Malcom Brown."""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's what I was trying to think of, but can't remember really.  When Brady missed 2008 I don't think they were doing the lists yet.

Rodgers never missed an entire season, just partials.

Revis maybe?  But even he played 2 games that year."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He doesn't seem to understand to entire concept of ""spell"" in the the term ""spell back"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Don't sleep on the Hawks, they are good"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's not really my point though bro, I'm not discounting Mariota here, I've seen tons of him, enough to last a lifetime, As an Eagles fan I've been bombarded with ""Mariota"" for over a year now lol.

Just saying Gruden tried to make RG3 more of a pocket passer, which kind of played away from his strengths.  I know Whisenhunt said he would adjust, but time will have to tell if he can go away from his typical mold and scheme for what he's wanted in a QB up until this point."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Absolutely dominant.....if he wanted to be.  Would take plays off, even games off sometimes.

But when he was on, motivated, one of the best players in the league.  Also could put him anywhere on the DL and have him be a matchup nightmare, even for elite OL.

And speaking of Madden OP, he was the best player I ever had in Madden lol.  I remember in Madden 08 one game, he had 19 sacks for me, and I wasn't cheesing or anything, I was user controlling another player, Peppers was CPU controlled.  And this is on All Madden as well.  19 sacks in one game lol."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Hope he's ok...that didn't look good tho
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Since you replying to anything I said within 2 to 3 minutes.

Tell me your 5 favorite moments from the Patriots 2004 season within 4 minutes.  I know you've read it because of the velocity of your responses, so any longer than 4 minutes, don't bother because I know you're just googling it.

And no SB moments, they are too easy to look up.

Go."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh, and who did most people call the MVP of the Cowboys?  

Wasn't it that fella who won OPOY, always forget his name...

And for the record, the Redskins ended our playoff hopes, so there's that.

Also, Mark Sanchez."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I do like that actually, I'm actually anxious to see if he got the message from the coaching staff too that they aren't just gonna give him snaps because he was the 1st round pick.

It's almost like when most of us are talking about the team now we totally forget he's even on it :(

Show em you got it MS2!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh for sure there is, it's just kinda sad when they put on different teams and then only talk about the Patriots, and never talk about that team lol.  

Like what's the point?

I mean is it this ruse that it's not just Pats fans who are defending the Pats kinda thing?  Like anyone actually gives a shit?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"DeSean has been bracketed most of his career man.

The Skins are loaded with weapons?  Those QB's and he put up comparable stats to what he usually did?

Dude, I'm not doubting him, but way to early to say Top 5.  Teams have tape now."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, yes, Wade Philips bad, Jason Garrett good.  I get the narrative.  Let's forget that Wade Phillips is an amazing defensive coach, just a bad head coach.  But if you don't think that Wade Philips had tons to to do with that D, I dunno what to tell you.  Don't bother replying to this because you can just google it, but tell me you can name the Cowboys DC in those year without looking it up.

No paper, they were a good team.  Defensively, this team or last years team doesn't even come close to comparing.  Are you hedging your bets on guys like Gregory who we've never even see play at all?  Jones who we've never see play?  Lawrence who we've barely seen play?   Lee coming off three ACL's, assuming he'll be the same guy he was 3 years ago?

Like, no, not on paper.  You are accusing me of not watching the games, but really, it doesn't seem like you did man.  If you don't think those defenses were leagues better than what the Cowboys have now or last year, I don't know what to tell you."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He was more referring to PM Colts though.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Era rules and style variance is gonna skew things to recent offenses looking way better.

But the Greatest Show on Turf Rams, 2007 Pats, 2013 Broncos, the Coryell Chargers are some that come to mind."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"To be honest, i don't know enough about the Broncos part.  Haven't done as much research.

But the Lambeau thing happened, that was probably the warning shot if anything.  This was common knowledge for the public, quite sure the league knew and it was probably a key factor in sending out the little ""reminder"" memo.

Honestly, this is where we are at now, the NFL is out the get the Pats?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"There were leaks, who they came from, we can't say for sure.  That's also speculation, it's like someone dug up that tweet from that NFL VP, who used to be in the FO for the Jets, now the unconfirmed speculative story line is that this former Jets FO member, so bitter over BB leaving the Jets, has leaked stuff to the press, he's the one for sure.....based on what?  I hear all the time on here about proof and hard evidence, then we see stuff like this that is a pot/kettle situation?

I mean Mort reports that 11 of 12 balls were deflated, and now the connection is made to this guy because he was a former Jets FO member?  Where is the connection other than speculative?  Couldn't it also be possible Mort just made it up, as Mort as been caught doing many times over the years?

I just don't see how Brady would prefer to take this to court rather than handle it internally....I mean think back to BB saying ""you'd have to ask Tom""...it was no secret from the beginning that Brady was the central figure in this thing, and that his cooperation was gonna be paramount, the NFL has punished for being un cooperative and not forthcoming before, this was no secret.

We can't forget that this isn't a criminal court of law case, it's an internal matter, there is no burden of proof, and smoking murder weapons aren't needed.

And they did assure him that he and his council could supervise the whole thing...why not go along with that unless there was something to hide?  Why look at a long game of court, where the phone wouldn't be subject to such assurances?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Seriously there is about 20 threads with the same exact topic right now
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You are a bandwagon, you don't know shit about those teams do you.  Took you too long, Mr Google.

Of course you are gonna jump to a conclusion, I gave you my answer, it wasn't the ""Patriotz cheated"" answer you wanted and were prepping for, so here you are, still grasping at straws that ""everyonez hatez da Patz"" and that everyone is just mad over a prior loss.

So weak and lame lol.

Enjoy defending them for the nest 8 years again whenever you bring up ""da ringz"", Brady and BB get the rings, you get to sound like a fool defending them, not to mention, you weren't even a fan back then quite obviously, you couldn't even answer, you just went with what you could google the fastest .  Yet you come on the internet with big boy pants proclaiming ""ringzzzz""

Bye, enjoy defending the cheaters for 8 years again bud lol, now he's driving LOL."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You don't understand how this works bro.....

Offseason study of tape, while teams are adjusting scheme for the upcoming year and have months to do so, vs in season tape watching of one week which has to include many players, plays, offense, defense and ST's

Good comparison"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,ACL stem cells
ImTheOnlyChipHere,How far do you think that line of thinking will go with Wilson and his agent?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"We are the NFL's only hope, only the Eagles can stop the Giants in the playoffs

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,[Who would do that?](http://philly.barstoolsports.com/files/2013/02/nnamdi-asomugha-lunch-in-car.jpg)
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Or it's just stupid to think that a guy that has played 4 years is the GOAT?

No picks, it's just stupid.  Clearly."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Consistency....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's unfortunate, because Byron Jones is awful in off man.  He's not great in press either, but off man, well, you watch the tape and decide for yourself....I watched a lot predraft myself...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I agree, it would be more like the Chris Benoit case in hindsight"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh yes, it was Rolle, my mistake

Still though, the whole size thing does kinda get thrown off by Hicks, so I dunno why we would be trying to trade Kendricks really...I mean maybe it's a long term cap thing, Cox, Johnson, Alonso, Bradford all due for deals soon?  But then again, Johnson will essentially take Peters' money when Peters' retires, and Kendricks will take Ryans' money when he moves on....

I dunno, Kendricks played very well last year IMO, love his tackling and his pursuit, and it's been forever since we've had a LB that can cover TE's well"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Please relegate the Pats propaganda sources to /r/Patriots

Thanks"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think in terms of fantasy, Cooks is primed to be a stud this year"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Shotgun Power or Shotgun Gut
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I dunno dude, would an agent lie to protect his client?

Sounds farfetched..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,You kidding...look at his guarantee compared to others....if anything if he gets hurt he's set...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Explain
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Last time we had a healthy QB for a full year, *7 fucking years ago*, we make the NFCC...go figure...

Can we get Sam that leg thing that magically healed all Batman's injuries in the Dark Knight Rises?

In the bright side, if Bradford does get hurt, it's nothing we weren't used to already lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The Patriots were blowing out the Colts too, they had a RB get 200 yards on the Colts with an arguably inferior OL....and he didn't have a broken hand either.

Just saying, you said it's because of the older OL weren't as good, but the only other game Randle had over 10 carries, in 2014, same story, under 3.0 YPC..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Why Dupree?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Get the feeling the Pats will take him
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He had me at ""ol Tiki"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Oooo how long did you take to think that one up
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's no Edelman I'll tell you that....
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You said I was in all the Cowboys threads.

I had a conversation yesterday in a thread not about the Cowboys, not about the Eagles, was a generic thread, and I had a conversation with a Cowboys fan, Hivenode, and despite our banter, if you clear the tears away from your eyes long enough you'd see how we were quite cordially talking about our teams respective CB's as the conversation went on....

Really, one comment, in one thread, that's your smoking gun?  From a link another user posted?  Really?

Where are ""all the Cowboys threads"".  Links?  Oh and make sure you get the ones where it's just big ol bad me in there, and the orderly Boys fans being orderly....

So in order not to hurt your precious feelings to prevent you from going to cry to ~~mommy~~ moddy, should I just never talk to Cowboys fans on here?  Are there any other fan bases you don't want me to talk to Dad?  Again, at least next time you are gonna cry about me, be man enough to /u/

Don't forget to down vote, that'll really show me, oh and here, take your up vote too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I assume he's referring to Kraft saying they'd accept whatever the NFL decided.

Then going to: “fighting the league and extending this debate would prove to be futile.”

Now saying how it's all ""not fair"".

Whatever your stance is on the issue, he certainly hasn't been sticking with his original statement back in February-ish that they would just accept whatever the NFL decided."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Actually, that pretty much is the question, going into 2015, who will be/is the best."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"IIRC wasn't Roy Willams also in a contract year at that point too?  The Eagles were another one the rumored teams at the trade deadline for him, remember there was huge hype going around for it at the time, our WR's had been crap for years.

But I do remember Dallas gave him a new contract within the season as well."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I try and play with a different team every time.  I don't care who, I'll play the Jags as much as I'll play the Seahawks (although I'll admit, in M25, the Seahawks and 49ers had such an advantage for the CPU getting cheap hitstick fumbles for you, everyone seemed to always be Seahawks or 49ers due to this and the fast QB, that I would often level it out with picking whoever my opponent didn't pick....go figure most of the time the guys who only pick Seahawks/49ers would refuse to play anyone who also picked Seahawks/49ers....)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol yea the Eagles fan base was pretty high on a Kendricks-Kendricks middle lol

He should be a great fit for the Vikings, I love their draft"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ya but dude, teams had no tape on Beckham either.

Why do we just assume that Beckham is gonna repeat a rookie season where they had no tape?

I agree on Foles, there was no tape, and it was a new system that there was no tape on either.  Team will study Beckham just like they did all the other WR's, it's the 2nd and 3rd seasons that really show who a guy is.

Not doubting him, just saying, we have to see more before we crown him.   I'm like Dennis Green on this.  I'm not letting him off the hook lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's either in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXYLlrJ5OFY

Or I may have saw it here (more gif based): http://nflbreakdowns.com/scouting-report-alvin-bud-dupree-kentucky/

ImTheOnlyChipHere,Just one is cool man...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's big talk from a guy with a whole 100 career carries

TIL when your most notable career highlight has been stealing some Fruit of the Looms, it gives you the right to shit talk the reigning OPOY"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Something that's also really interesting about the Eagles being first on the list:

For years the Eagles would hold offseason at Lehigh university, and I remember one year, holy shit they were dropping like flies.  ACL's, the whole deal.

In 2013....the Eagles stopped holding offseason at Lehigh...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dear god man.

I don't understand why you guys have to circle jerk him so much on here, everyone already thinks he's great like wtf"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt;Everyone likes to point and laugh at Dallas

You had me there bro, I didn't even bother reading the rest"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For the token LolSB's part of it: [The Eagles are the only team in the ranked Top 10 in total wins since the year 2000 that hasn't won the big one](http://www.therichest.com/sports/football-sports/the-10-best-nfl-teams-this-millenium/).  And we are actually 5th on the list.

Also something that is not well known, for the McNabb led Eagles, it was something like 3 or 4 years where McNabb led zero 4th quarter comebacks.  We were either up going into the 4th, or we lost.

We also haven't had our opening day QB play a full season in 7 years.

Last year we lost every Sunday game played at 4:30"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"To be fair, workplace banging is something that pretty commonplace, and the higher you go the more it's typically overlooked.  It's taboo and against most official policy, but really one of the parties typically has to kick up a stink of harassment or something of the like for it to be acted upon.

The ""I want my 2nd round pick back"", Dear God that would never happen."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Honestly man it was months ago, linked via /r/nfl, I don't have it saved or anything, but he's a pretty knowledgeable guy who has been following sports a very long time."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"My memory of how many years it was is a bit hazy, this was in 2009 I remember it was said after we beat the Bears that it had been a very long time since we had a 4th Q comeback under McNabb (granted, McNabb has a lot of missed time during some of those years)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Eagles are the same I think, if we were interested, which why wouldn't we be, I dunno if Chip would just promise him a starting spot, that doesn't go with how Chip has said he runs the team.

You earn you spot, it's not mandatory you just get it.

Also as mentioned, Collins said he wants to play T"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ok think about it, and keep in mind, I know his son is sitting in the big chair now, I get all that, but it's still Jerry's team.

1. Romo's Kimmel interview.  Romo told that story about how they were talking about re-signing Murray, and how Jerry and Romo's window is closing.  That is true, for different reasons, one kinda dark but whatever, Romo told the story and he said it lol.  Now think about Jerry Jones, a man of immense pride and ego, the kind of guy who hands playoff tickets out before he ever makes the playoffs.  The kind of guy who I remember DeMarcus Ware said one offseason was relentless around training camp telling players this was the year etc.  This guy wants another chip before he ""moves on"".  

2. That interview he gave about the 1st round picks after the draft.  He was asked about would he consider trading a 1st now that he scored Jones, Gregory and Collins, all 1st round grades, would he consider parting with the 2016 1st for a player like he's done in the past.  He didn't exactly say no:

&gt;""I'd be reluctant to, but certainly if the right situation came along that could improve us now, with where we are with (35-year-old quarterback) Tony Romo, his career and where we are with what we've put together, it's a good time to go for it,"" Jones said, per Fox Sports Southwest.

Now this is one quote, he also followed up lamenting about the Roy Williams deal and how it stung etc.  However, Collins was a Top 15 talent, Gregory has issues aside from weed but talent wise he's a top talent as well.  If I look at that, it does kinda make the 2016 1st expendable

3. He loves AP

4. He loves AP

5. AP is willing to take a pay cut to play in Dallas.  Won't be massive, and I'm sure he'll still want more than Murray and McCoy average, but did I mention JJ loves AP?

6. He saw what a strong running game did for his team, a perpetual 8-8 team, 8-8 in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013....giving the ball to Murray allowed them to mask deficiencies on defense by controlling the TOP.  Can Randle or DMC do that?  Maybe a better question is, if JJ was completely confident he was all set, would he be rolling in re-treads like Felix Jones and Ben Tate?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Worked out pretty good, we should keep going to see if we can make it a 1st in like 2018"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,If you had a sense of humor and self humility it might?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And let't not pretend that guy who just carried 10 times, is gonna look as fast as a guy who came off the bench for one or two carries.

He had 50 carries for the season combined, and average of 3 carries a game....Murray had an average of 25 carries a game....no shit he looks fresher and faster when he comes out in the 3rd Q for his 2 carries"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I dunno, like I remember the Cowboys game from this year, like he looked like he was just at his 9-5 grind it out until quitting time job the whole game.   He looked like that this was the last place on the planet he wanted to be.

I don't remember him being that way in Denver, but that was awhile ago.  I can see during the Martz years him becoming frustrated, like he was being left out for dead out there with a terrible OL and Martz's routes and concepts weren't conducive to that....but he just seems like he's punching a clock or something

[There is this too](http://i.imgur.com/43KwAQt.gif), it's like seeing a unicorn lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ah, so how is this part of the Goodell Marketing Machine?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ohhhhh...a joke, ya, ok..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"As a fan both are fun, but sneaking in on the Wildcard is more fun as a fan I'd say.

2008 was exciting to watch because we would be up, we would be left for dead, back up again, throw up a clunker, then pulled it all out in Week 17 for the last wildcard."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They typically decline closer to about 30, while other positions like OL, LB, DL and even WR can play into their 30's at a high level

Being 21 means I'll probably get more mileage out of them potentially, although RB can be more tied to total carries to be fair."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What, teams other than the Cowboys have acquired players on rookie contracts as well over the past few years?

I think you may wanna check your research on this"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well, let's simplify it, which one has been caught and punished for tampering with footballs that was only possible as a result of this rule?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Fair enough, there is a point there, just saying OJ is the only one with a 14 game schedule.

I also think TD's 2000 in underrated too, it gets forgotten that the Bronco's would often be blowing teams out that year, and TD would be sat down a lot in the 2nd half IIRC."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They also had an elite OL as well, something that is often underrated about those Jets teams."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Exactly, sacks are far from everything.

Several years ago Jason Babin had one of the highest sack totals in football, but he was an awful run defenders, and unless he was sacking the QB, he was absolutely useless.

People rely on ""sacks"" as the be all end all way too much, there is so much more to DL and pass rusher than just sacks"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's a pretty brash strategy, but Ben Dogra is very used car salesman.

This is kinda all coming out of left field, some pretty crazy shit he's saying for one of the highest paid players in the league.

I've thought he was going to end up in Dallas for awhile myself for many reasons, this just adds to the pile"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You said that it's a setup by the NFL so they could create parity and get more profits.

And you've been defending that very poorly."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This is awful considering he *just* lost a full year 

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Really?  I didn't see that, Maclin's route running is top notch, Agholor has great understanding of routes and manipulating zones and NFL level route running for college level, but to say he's better or even near Maclin is a real stretch.

Seems like a great kid though, but then again, Maclin is a great guy too.

I do like how he will fight for balls though, he won't win 50/50's like say Dez, but he'll fight for them.  Maclin's only real knock is that he does not like contact."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,http://i.imgur.com/PWu1nsM.gif
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What you got against Nelson?  

I mean MS2 hasn't done anything, thats warranted, but why Nelson?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You are forgetting that Brady, Vilma, Gordon - all did something wrong!

This is on par with how Goodell has always handled things, it's just a double standard that he's so unfair now.  I mean c'mon, how many posts have we seen over this whole thing that this all just ""the NFL out to get the Patriots"", when that's just not true at all."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol I clearly said it was last year....how is that not keeping up on the news?  

I saw Cam getting abused last year, how about that news

Lol you guys are being mega homer, here bud, whether you agree with PFF rankings or not, [the Panthers had the 22nd ranked OL overall, and the 27th overall for pass protection](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/2/).....but no, everything is fine with Michael Oher added now, who was a sieve last year, playing LT on that 28th overall OL, and getting a terrible grade from PFF for it.

It's alllll good can reach on TE/WR tweeners and LB/S tweeners, no need for OL, everything is perfect
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They were still blitzing a lot tho, still a lot of Nascar.  Tuck would come, Tuck dropped on the Celek TD.

They brought the DB blitz on that 3rd down scramble by Vick deep in our own territory.  The DB just took a bad angle to the inside allowing Vick to get outside.

On offense I'd say they took the foot off the gas a bit, not on defense though.  Still tons of blitzes in that last 8 minutes."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Didn't you guys lose to Mark Sanchez and Colt McCoy?

You guys better pray it's Bradford, Cowboys struggle with backup QB's..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Another one is the bozo's on here that think just because of Chung that everything about Fletcher is unfounded.

That one Pats fan Horny Hindi or something on here was one of them that was going on about it IIRC.

Just shows a real misunderstanding of scheme and coverage concepts.  It's like, did you eat paint chips an hour before you typed that?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Nope, I have mad respect for BB and Brady and many Pats players and have said as much a lot on here.  Seymour is my favorite DL of the 2000's.

It's just hilarious all the extreme, uneducated opinions a lot of Pats fans have on here.  Like literally, the majority have no clue what they are talking about."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They were 4-12 the team he took over, and switching to a 3-4 with 4-3 personnel dude.

I mean, two 10 win seasons with a 4-12 roster....and he's said many times this offseason that 10 wins is just not good enough for him, that's not why he came here.

Of course I'm being a bit homer here, but it's not like he inherited a roster that was coming off Reid's best teams here."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And he was playing on a team that just went undefeated the year prior...

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What was I thinking....

I like Kendricks a lot actually, just surprised he missed that many."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Of course you don't.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Wikipedia...nice.

What was the reason they destroyed all the evidence?  Any link for that?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Romo calls the checks....learn how to read ya nimrod.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's all lawyers and it's probably quite boring in reality I would imagine.

[I think you have a visual of it going like this OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVXn1kLNj4)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea but Luck was 1st overall.  Like some draftniks have said, if Russell Wilson was 4-5 inches taller, teams would have taken him in the 1st no problem.

Wilson is gonna get his, think of the league right now, I posted a list yesterday, but it's like half the league you could very reasonably say would be interested in him if he hit the market, and would sign him to a mega deal making him the richest guy in the league.

Speaking for the Eagles, Chip Kelly would be all friggin over this guy."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dear God, really?

I like Gregory too, but guys like Jason Peters and Trent Williams will absolutely abuse a 235lb 4-3 DE, Rod Marinelli or not.  He's got a lot of work to do, starting off with gaining about 25 lbs"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes Debbie Downer, thats what I meant

You must be a real hit at parties"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,We'll just have to live with watching Tony Romo sack himself 3 times out of fear behind that greatest of great OL's.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For /r/nfl, any of the ones from the Giants guy on here, forget his name but his gifs take the cake"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Evans will be Top 25 next year, book it"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't think Irving can last two more series, he's pretty banged up

LeBron has been amazing, that block on Rose a few nights ago...outstanding"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously??? 

How is this possible 

This is reminiscent of the NFL Top 100 players of all time list a few years back, and they left out Derrick Thomas... That was bs, and leaving David out now is too"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I just hate that game man.

And in both games like you said...Polk?  In the Cards game Polk is the one that got us up there, then we took him out?  It's the same old song for us for years, but it's kind of like when we could never punch it in in these situations in the McNabb era too, and we would always lament that we need a power runner.  Polk is a power runner, that's his thing, I know the 49er defense was playing outstanding and we had OL issues, but at least put Polk in and do PA...Spyder 2 Y banana anyone (but that 4th down does have some Spyder 2 Y banana concepts to it).

I just loathed after the Cards game how Chip said he didn't sneak it because it failed against Dallas in 2013....

I'm not presuming I know more than Chip or what plays better to call than him, those games just piss me off.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's throwing his career away is he does this
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Deion Sanders, his recovery speed as a CB was unmatched.

You could have 5 yards on him and it didn't matter.  He could bait QB's like no other."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Let's take the Jets tho, base alignment, 3-4.

DE - NT - DE (Wilkerson)

OLB - ILB - ILB - OLB (Pace)

Who is the T blocking counting it's not with filled stunts and blitzes etc, if the formation has the weak side on Wilkerson/Pace?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I wasn't being serious, Welker is way better than Edelman

To judge a guy who led the NFL in catches for many years, and IIRC leads the NFL in catches since 2007, to say he has bad hands because of some dropped passes on a big stage, that's pretty silly.  

That's like saying the restaurant is awful because the icing on the dessert wasn't great, even though the meal and appetizers were fantastic.

Edelman is a not a better WR than Wes Welker."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Jake Fisher?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"All-22 would be very hard to find on torrent sites.  I'm on a all football torrent site with tons of content, and they don't even have it.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt; Wilson won't sign the franchise tag until the final six games of the season to get an accrued season.

Doubt it, when has that ever happened really?  Players leverage that, but don't go through with it.  You think Justin Houston actually isn't gonna sign that tender?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,He's in for sure
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's one play man.

Didn't Ted Ginn and Stevie Johnson also have huge games against Revis too?  

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"My God, forget it.

This isn't a court of law, this is what you guys don't understand.  This is his employer."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"http://overthecap.com/position/defensive-line/

6 out of the top 10 total value contracts are interior DL.  And keep in mind, when the Bills signed Mario, they were 3-4, and they were using him at 5 tech IIRC, so you can almost say 6.5 kinda.

If you look at guaranteed it's a bit skewed because of rookie deals, which is related to draft position over quality of player."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Haha you phony

Buh bye little parasite, have fun with your butthurt"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Throw Albert Haynesworth onto that list too.

I dunno what that guy is talking about, BB has taken many chances on guys with questionable character over the years"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Sorry, I remembered that they did, must have been just for part of the year.  Didn't go back and check the final tallies.  They still had a very effective rushing game, and to say that McFadden/Randle will be just as good or even better is kinda off.  McFadden has been wildly inconsistent, and Randle had been a spell back with limited carries,  we can't judge him on that.  It's like saying Choice could be a feature back, he was good in his role, but he wasn't a feature back.  Take Ward from the Giants, good in his role, but once he went to Tampa and took over the lead role, he wasn't that guy.

I know it's all the craze to discredit Murray right now, especially because of the team he ended up with, but the suggestions that it's all the OL and anyone could do what Murray did is silly.  If that were true, I don't think they would have had the carry distribution the way it was right?

Bennett wasn't the same guy, but he was decent as a 2nd to Witten.  Witten is still good, but his prime has passed.  He's not just as good as he was, no way, Jason Witten back then was crazy.

I'm not saying it's a bad team or anything, I'm saying to say ""this is the best team we've had in a long time"", which was what I was replying to originally, is kinda short sighted to those teams, especially for defense and the run game."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,*pass rush intensifies*
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Doesn't say that anywhere

Would you like some fries with your salt?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I love how they are pulling a quote out and trying to make it out of context, typical media click bait.

He's clearing just referring to Spygate.  The single sentence quote alludes that he is referring to more.

&gt;""Everybody's blowing it up because it is Tom Brady,"" Revis said Wednesday. ""I understand that. But if (the NFL) feels he did the crime or he did something and they want to penalize them, then that's that. (The Patriots) have a history of doing stuff. You can't hide that. Tom was there when they did that stuff in the past.""

This isn't even news."

Legally.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I like how it was to his own comment, as if he read his post and just said ""by gosh, there is no bash on the Eagles in here"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""We gotta do a better job on that""

""times yours""

-every Andy Reid post game presser after a loss for 13 years"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,And the reasoning is the NFL is out to get the Pats like some James Bond villain?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"TIL 998 yards after 1st contact - not so great vision.

May I ask sir, did these articles by ""Cowboys beat writers and bloggers"" come before March 13th or after?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"His vids are great, thanks for the link"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Uh huh
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh we are on to spelling now, dear god

Buh byeeeeee"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol says the guy who openly encouraged other Pats fans to report non-Pats fans posts

What a cop out response, no one cares about that stuff dude.

You went around trying to create a stigma that fans of other fan bases also support the Patriots and defend them.  God knows why.

You put Texans flair on then just talked about the Patriots...then when a few of us caught you doing it(like you don't do it all the time anyway), you lied about it lol

Not a fake account...until next week when you delete this one like you've done others and make a new one and pretend you are just a simple fan of a random team that just has to stick up for the poor ol Pats in 95% of his posts





"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No idea who that is, I was replying to your post....

I rarely pay attention to the username, more the post and what the person is saying"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh yes I remember that now!

Thats some weird shit man lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He's not up there with Watkins, Evans and OBJ, but he had a pretty good season considering Foles didn't target him a ton in the first 9 weeks.  Most of his production is from Sanchez on.

I think he's primed to be a 1000+ yard guy this season, everyone points to that he played slot here and played some slot at Vandy too, but he's 6'3, he can probably play outside too.  He's probably taking the role that Jackson/Maclin had this season, and those guys had the best years of their careers as Chip's number 1.

People forget guys like Jordy started in the slot too.

I like Landry too as possession guy in short and intermediate."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Jason Peters.  OL don't really get the love that the skill position guys do, and it makes sense why, it's not sexy.

But Peters, even getting up in years, is just so athletic for a man his size.  I saw the NFL Top 100 from last year on Peters, guys talking about how it just seems like he's playing with guys sometimes.   Great instincts, knows how to use his body and balance so well, it's gonna be a shame when he retires."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,According to Panther fans yesterday there were no tackles that could start day 1 from the Funchess selection on
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Just make sure to inflate everything to the proper specified levels then.

In the interest of ~~fairness~~  safety"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ajayi has a foot injury, bone on bone from what I heard.

Still, Murray and leaning on the run game dramatically changed that offense last year, dunno if those guys can fill his shoes.  If the Boys thought the other guys could fill the void they probably would have split up the carries better, but I think the final tally was Murray 400 the other guys like 90 combined?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You are literally leading the vanguard in every deflate gate thread at an obsessive level every day

""I want to get into it again"" lol
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Cam Luck and Wilson getttttinnnn ppppaaaiidddd son.

$46M guarantee...Rodgers is at $57M...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh so I guess his career is done.

Guys, call Chip, tell him we're fucked now.

You said:

&gt;Still doesnt sound like something thats just gonna be okay for a full season

I asked you what information you are basing this from.

Your answer was he has missed games before.

Is that the sounds you were hearing?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,We would do that without music
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Agree, I think back to the /r/nfl thread that shows the NFL had a 20,000 yard increase for passing yards from 2003-2013.  20,000 yards overall in 10 years!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,LE's are usually bigger than RE's bro...
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Shoo fly, have no time for phonies "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"We might see some action on June 1st and a few weeks after.

June 1st cuts means they can spread out a cap hit over 2 years instead of one, makes it easier to absorb.

Usually their aren't many, but there should be some."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea I see that as a potential RG3/Gruden situation, going away from his strengths too much and maybe trying to make him into something he's not.

Also that they are probably gonna throw him out there Day 1.  I was of the belief that even if he came to Chip, he probably shouldn't start Day 1."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Sno Caps Perhaps?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"If I'm Wilson, I'll gladly walk to the market where the Browns, Jets, Bills, Texans, Bears, Eagles, Redskins and Rams will all surely offer me a contract.

Throw in the Chargers, Raiders, Broncos, Chiefs, Giants, Bengals, Saints and Cardinals all as maybe's.

If I'm Wilson, I have no issue at all walking to the market, I'm gonna get this highest paid contract no matter what."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's a pretty hefty hometown pay cut....

I'm comparing these two because they both just signed new deals very recently.

Revis' average is $14M.  CHJ is $8.5M

CHJ is what, 5 years younger as well, but took 40% less?

Elway is just that good of a sweet talker?  C'mon...

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"With a broken friggin hand, what's Randle's reason"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"OP put a very misleading title to this, insinuating that was not supposed to happen.  ""remotely ready"" are the words of the writer, no Eagles coach, trainer or Dr said those words.

Bradford was not supposed to be ready right now.  We've known this for awhile now, since the trade.  Bradford said it on his first presser the day after he was traded.  

This is not even news, this is OP trying to stir up something by taking two words out of an article."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol, your practice at deflecting over the past few weeks has honed the skill.

Ahahahaha, and it comes out, he was looking to fit the narrative all along.

So sad, have fun being a phony on the internet bud, proclaiming and bragging about Championships for a team that you didn't even watch when they won most of them.

You've been exposed you fraud lol

Buh Byyyyyeeeee"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Nicks fizzled off, he's been injured for 3-4 years now?  Is that what you are saying?

Again, Nick Foles."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Fining the Pats $1M is pretty much fining upper management.

And he did it, and he lied about it, that much is pretty clear."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol so much for the low end all guaranteed deal huh

This is no surprise, he's a QB that has been to two SB's in three years of playing, he's got all the leverage"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why don't you ask AJ Feeley if he was tampering with the balls before the rule change?

Or is Feeley just a hater too?

Pats fans at this point have been so brainwashed by the NESN's of the like that ""it's all not true"".  Yes, these guys with law degree's like Goodell and Wells making millions a year, all these Pats fans and Tom Curran know better than them.

Again, can you link me to your ""lolz Brady"" posts?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What I'm saying is, everyone has been exposed to this letter and thinks its this smoking gun thing....then a week later, Goodell just says, ""nah, I'm gonna do it still"".

I think it's being overstated and overhyped almost to the extent of like a free agency player signing, that Brady signed this ace free agent lawyer.  It's being taken like the NFL doesn't or hasn't had lawyers advising the whole way on this too.  I'll give you an example, I had one fan tell me that Kessler is amazing, like he had ever heard his name before last week, and that the NFL's lawyers were shit.  He then told me that Ted Wells, the investigator, would be representing the NFL for this....it's like a bad game of telephone the interpretations of what is read.

I mean, do you really believe that Goodell made this decision to not recuse himself without getting advisement from the NFL's lawyers first?  Like they are just so arrogant about Kesslers whole narrative that only Goodell can hand out that specific punishment and not Vincent, that Goodell just simply said ""IDGAF"" and just kept himself on?

The NFL and their lawyers can see several steps down the road too..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously, if you asked DC's who they fear more and have to plan for more, I bet 9 times out of 10 they say DeSean"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Oooo you got me
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This is the correct answer.

Era variance for size is misconstrued, it's more about the rule changes when comparing the 80's.  Maybe we go back to like the 50's and 60's and little bit of the 70's for size, like Mike Webster."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Bavaro was a beast, Gronk is very much like him in how he could break tackles and drag multiple guys behind him.

I remember in the 1986 America's Game, LT is talking about Bavaro, and there is a play from that year that most of us have probably seen on NFLN at one time or another, where Ronnie Lott is literally being dragged behind Bavaro and he just couldn't bring him down.  LT was like ""that's not just nobody, that's Ronnie Lott that can't bring him down!"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,QB
ImTheOnlyChipHere,GOAT LS as of 3 minutes ago
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No but, is it an official rule they can't play?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"To be fair to that, teams were already stacking the box a bit on us last year.  Teams feared Jackson way more than they did Maclin deep.  Maclin's main strengths were intermediate, his route running would get him open a ton, but Foles/Sanchez would miss a ton of throws.

Run game will definitely be more power based - and that's exactly what Chip Kelly wants though.  One cut, hit the hole.  For Sproles, he'll be used very sparingly, I imagine that Murray is gonna get about 270 ish carries, Mathews 160 ish, and Sproles probably around 40 or 50 and be mixed in to do different things on passing downs.

Bradford, we'll see, but as a QB, he actually is a pretty good QB, very good arm, and pretty accurate too.  Someone posted a super long series of gifs in the Eagles sub on all of his throws, and the amount of dropped balls the Rams WR's had on this guy, like holy shit.  Had no idea, but it's like every few plays, on target pass dropped."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's not our uniform, but he does often have his face in the turf when he plays us, so I guess that part is accurate."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think going T was smart though.  That OL os not good, and you just spent 1st overall on a QB.  

Totally agree about the MLB in Lovie's Tampa 2, Urlacher is what made that defense go, but I don't disagree with the T pick"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'd say that looks very ACL-ish
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Awwww, that's really sweet of you to say

We'll pass that along to him"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He's a LS tho, he doesn't have that age cutoff other positions do

Dorenbos Eagles 4 Life!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I think the entire NFC East all had good drafts
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"If you find one, call Mr K. at 555-CHIP

VERY interested"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Nice to see at least one Cowboys fan actually watched football back then
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt;He went from a guy that probably would have struggled without TO and Witten to a guy that got Laurent Robinson a big payday in Jacksonville because Romo made him look that good.

Nice argument, lol.

And no, you don't seem to know your team at all.  Especially with all your ""on paper"" talk lol.  You look up stats like its the be all end up, you need context for stats, you seem new to football but you'll understand eventually don't worry, takes time."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They are similar and do share concepts for sure.

I just think he'd be better off sitting for a bit, even with Chip.  He still has to adjust to the NFL level back 7's even if he is more familiar with the offense."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, like if any of us were 72 year old billionaires we would be doing any different lol

Power to the guy man"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ya but Brady had that epic juke on Urlacher, that's gotta count for something"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yea, a better question would be why didn't TO/Roy or Austin/Roy work.

I mean, they got a 1st, 3rd and 6th for him...that's just too good to turn down when you just drafted Megatron as well"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"1. Adams Gurode and Davis were all Pro Bowlers.  Not Pro Bowlers from times passed, Pro Bowlers in those years.

2. Barber/Jones/Choice, a trio that led the NFL in rushing....you would take McFadden/Williams Randle....ok dude, this doesn't sound good.  THEY LED THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING.

3. Rest of the WR's and TE's are a wash?  Jason Witten in his Prime?  Miles Austin?  Martellus Bennett?  You can't be serious here.  TO at an older age was still very effective...he's one of the most intelligent route runners I've ever seen.  

4. Top 5 defenses aren't great....TIL. 

You lost me here, I'm not even gonna bother.  And this isn't just any old Top 5, this is Top five at the height of the Steelers D, one of the best D's the Ravens ever had, the Eagles D in Jim Johnson's last year, and the Giants D coming off a SB...the Cowboys were up there with these very, very good defenses.

Way younger and way more talented....you are throwing Gregory and Lawrence out there....one who we haven't even seen play yet, and the other we've barely seen play."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,The obvious answer is when OP said not to include the obvious answer of Collins.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"What if I told you, there was a player who always forgot to eat before the game: 

Tenders and Dogs, the Mark Sanchez story."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Let's it this way, a few years ago, who would you have taken, Maclin or Nicks?

I think everyone would have said Nicks,  same draft class, same round.

In today's NFL, both guys have suffered injuries, Maclin has had a bunch, who would you take, Maclin or Nicks?

Things change."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why?  PFF is going by their cumulative grades are they not?

In terms of this discussion, how could it possibly be unfair if they are (apparently) ranking guys every game by the same grading system?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Getting out of shotgun with the game on the line when down at the goal line....*cough* Cardinals game *cough* 49ers game

Also, sneaks with your 6'6 QB in the same situation because they failed in a game the year prior as the excuse why.

A lot of our unsuccessful plays were more personnel based, like fades to Cooper in the redzone, he's big but that's just not him, he doesn't know how to use his size, body or hands effectively for 50/50's.

Also we would run a ton of sweeps with multiple pulling OL, then McCoy just wouldn't hit the hole waiting for another hole so he could try for a home run (last year), then we'd end up with nothing or negative."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You make some valid, well thought out points man.

Our OL, definitely a concern....for 2015 though?  Mathis and Peters are getting long in the tooth, can't deny that and no player no matter how good can beat father time.  However, Peters and Mathis still played at a very high, elite level last year, two of the top ranked OL in the entire league still.  For 2016 and 2017, big concern for sure.  You don't just find elite OL out of thin air.

Depth is a bit of a concern if we do have injuries again, can it be worse than last year though (knock on wood)?  Literally the entire OL except Peters was injured at one time or another, sometimes up to 4 starters out at once....we still finished 10-6 with our backup QB no less...

Maclin hurts for sure, but I explained my feeling on the WR position in a post later in this stream.  I won't discount Maclin for a second, the guy is a extremely good and smart and had working route runner.  Only knock I ever had on Mac was he hates contact and has always shied away from it, but I've had that opinion since his rookie preseason.

We lost some positions, however, does that positives outweigh the negatives?  We can talk about WR but then we ignore the possible progression we've made at CB and LB.

RB, depends what you want and what you like, and Chip definitely made no secret that he wanted one cut hit the hole *before* the McCoy trade."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ohhh, we really need like a guidebook for this, would make things easier to understand"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Did you see that Falcons game?  And then the Ravens game 3 weeks later?

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Because they don't go on carrying on conversations with members of whatever fan base they are relentlessly complimenting the Patriots?

Saying ""if only we didn't run into the Patriots man, we would have been set!!!""

This is all created in your own head man, the Patriots are caught in a scandal, is what it is.

You gonna touch on any of my points from the original conversation or just go on and on about how I've blown your house down?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Your non-answers are hilarious.

Where my link?  Rough guess lol.

Really, tell me how 11 out of 12 footballs were deflated...oh wait, that was a total lie...last year you say, that is funny, you are right.

Haha facts, have you read your posts?  Facts???"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I wouldn't go that far, RG3's problems extend beyond just on the field"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He had it all, potential to be the GOAT"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I thought I read that he got his law degree while working for the league, I know he's worked for the league pretty much his whole adult life, but I thought I read he had a law degree as well.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, from the guy who thinks because a Pats fan complimented another player, God Forbid he might have thought he was better than Tawm at one thing....he must be a fake fan of another team in disguise!!!

Pot meet kettle.

When's recess Silky

Don't forget to mash the down vote button, that'll show me!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You mean like, one page?

You guys are really grasping at this one here huh?

So glad you guys remember things I say though, I'm honored, and touched, really."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They can go to court if they want, and if they want to take it to a proper court, Brady's phone is the first thing asked for in discovery.  And now they have to give it.

This whole conversation started by saying ""lolz this is the rule Manning had changed"", why do we just laugh at Manning for getting rules changed and not Brady?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Seriously he needs to STFU, birthday camel life going to his head, he's still the highest paid RB in the NFL is he not?

He's getting like QB money..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"[Agholor and Jeremy Maclin have almost the exact same measureables](http://i.imgur.com/AXl7JGi.png) and even their production is pretty similar too.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"For every Moss there is a Ocho, for every Talib there is a Haynesworth.

I don't doubt BB is the best coach in football, I know plenty about him bro I can assure you, but to say everything he touches turns to gold is just not true.  And I'm sure BB himself would be the first to tell you that.

People like to point out the Moss' and the Talib's, but then ignore the Ocho's and the Haynesworth's.  How are they different aside from the former worked out and the latter didn't?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Look at the other side of Goodell's tenure.  

We all seem to think he sits in an ivory tower handing out suspensions and fines and pops his head in for the 1st round of the draft and that's his job because that's our exposure to him as fans.

Look at the NFL's revenues and profits since he's been in office.  Look at their increased global exposure, branching out to new demographics like the female market, primetime, the presentation and marketing of things like the draft...

There is a reason that 32 multi mililonaires/billionaires are giving this guy $40M a year..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ah, got ya

Ya, that definitely could be true too"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You don't find that hypocritical that it was only brought up by certain factions when something didn't go their way?

When it was balanced with no resolution, Wells firm had still done work for cig companies, but no one said boo, wasn't an issue.
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"How do we know they won't value the position more?

How do we know they aren't thinking Ford can step up?

You laugh at the notion that Ford could step up, 3-4 years ago if we said ""Justin Houston could take that role"", would you have laughed then too?

You assume ALOT of things."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,This is a very serious topic
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""Patriots reveal""

""NESN""

Next..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"We need matte helmets and back to the true, darker midnight green, not this thing Nike has now."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They do for sure, but I guess it's the volume of bandwagoners from the Pats right now that exacerbates it right now.

Like God forbid the guy has an opinion that isn't ""Tom Brady's shit doesn't stink""

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"That's what I'm saying, we'll see.

It's silly to discredit all the coaches around the NFL that they aren't gonna game plan this and Beckham is just gonna repeat this every year now.  Same goes for Watkins, Evans, Benjiman etc etc

IT'S ONE YEAR."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Again, they don't need a smoking gun, this isn't the American judicial system, they are his employers.  As per his agreement with the union, he is subject to their rulings and procedures, whether Pats fans or Don Yee and Tom Curran don't agree, it's irrelevant.

Also, where are your ""lolz Brady"" posts?   How many times you gonna duck this."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"2009 vs the Raiders.  

One the worst games of the Andy Reid Eagles era, against the lowly (no offense Raider fans) JaMarcus Russell led Raiders.

It's before the 2 minute warning, Raiders have the ball, we are doing the whole timeout schtick (Andy Reid and timeouts is the center of the story, surprise!).  The Raiders run the ball like you do, and with 2:02 left, Andy calls timeout after the 2nd down run.

This now opens it up so the Raiders can either run or pass, doesn't matter because the 2 minute warning is gonna stop the clock regardless.  If he waits and calls the TO after the two minute warning, sacrificing only two seconds of clock, the Raiders will no doubt definitely run the ball.

It should be noted, our younger, faster MLB Stewart Bradley is hurt at this time, and retread past his prime do not fucking put him out on passing situations whatever you do Jeremiah Trotter is out there.

The Raiders run a play action, a Spider 2 Y banana type play, Russell hits it to the FB, Trotter is too slow, boom, 1st down, game over.

Andy Reid timeout management in a nutshell right there.

Also something I will always remember from that game, probably my favorite DL from the 2000's, Richard Seymour, was on the Raiders at the time.  King Dunlap , who Chargers fans will know is a behemoth of a man, 6'9 and 330lbs, was subbing for an injury.  Seymour picked that kid up like a forklift and tossed him aside like a toddler, he fucking abused that kid all game long.  Seymour was a very, very powerful man."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,*[Philadelphia media](http://i.imgur.com/vf36e0n.gif)*
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"In what context OP?  

Like the GM doesn't make moves that the fans approve of?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Look at the run/pass ratios bro.  I don't mean it as a slight to Romo, but Romo would often not stay disciplined with the play calls, he would check in the wrong situations.  And it would often cost the Boys.  

Packers 2013 always comes to mind.  Vikings 2009 as well.  I'm not saying ""it's all Murray"" because Murray is an Eagle now, I'm saying just sticking with the run period.  It helped mask deficiencies on the defense as well by allowing the Cowboys to control TOP, Seahawks game is a great example of this working the way it should.

Again, I don't mean this as a slight to Romo at all, but as a Boys fan, dating back the even the Barber/Jones/Choice era, how many times did you hear JG say ""we are gonna run the ball more"" ""we have to run the ball more"", then the Cowboys just didn't do it.....now, combine that with Linehan being brought in, and Romo being stressed to stick with the game plan.

Honestly, could never figure out why they didn't run the ball more back in some of those seasons, they've had a good backfield dating back to at least when Barber was drafted."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"How do you know it had little to do with Goodell?

What information are you basing this off of?

Please no speculation, actual factual things that can be backed up please"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh, the ""everyone"" cheats retort.  Original.

That excuses this totally lol"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Because that's what most people base it from, ""well, PFF' and end of story, like these guys are God's word on football.

I don't think that's accurate that Del Rio asked CHJ to cover on an island anywhere near as much as BB did Revis.

How is actually watching a guy play not proof of anything??

Again, take NE's pass rush vs Denver's.  NE's sacks and pressures were much more coverage based.

Also, again, like I said earlier about interior DL vs pass rusher, follow the money.  Both guys got new contracts within the last year, Revis got more guaranteed that CHJ got for his entire deal.  Is CHJ and his agent just complete fools accepting so much less?  He's younger and just as good as Revis but he accepted wayyyy less money?  Is he an idiot?

We can say what we think, but the guys getting paid millions to hand out millions seemed to feel much differently about the value of both guys..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Forgive me, I forgot we have to play checkers with some of you guys not chess.

Let's take your original point, the NFL is out to get the Patriots to provide parity to the league, presumably to make the league more profitable.  

1. More profitable.  Is this assuming that if teams that are in the playoffs more often, they will be more profitable and therefore the league will be too?  I think you should go look up the most profitable teams in the NFL over the last 10 years and how much the teams at the top made the playoffs; and look at the NFL's growth in revenue and profit over the last 10 years as well, and ask yourself, why would they want that to change?

2. Parity.  I asked you why they didn't take PM teams and do the same.  Let's use 10 years as a measuring stick.  PM teams have 125 reg season wins over the last 10 years.  The NEP also have, 125 regular season wins over the last 10 years (not including PM or Brady's missed years).  Over the last 10 years, the Patriots have 12 post season wins, PM teams have 9.  A few more yes, but for the context of this discussion, at the very least, we should put the Pats down to 11, since the whole investigation started before the SB (remember, your basis point here is the NFL is only doing this as a witch hunt to get the Patriots, and this conspiracy started before the SB, therefor the NFL's motives had been predetermined to hatch this plan against the Pats.)  Not a big variance there.  So I'll ask again, why isn't the NFL out to get PM teams if the reason is parity?  PM teams almost always win their division too....

3. So I'll ask again, why would the NFL be out to get the Patriots?

Things are different when you have actual facts aren't they...."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,The Patriots weren't even a Top 10 defense in 2014....and you think they are anywhere near a discussion about Top 10 all time??

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So true man, totally depends on the neighborhood you are in, I moved recently, got a supposedly *faster* internet, but my neighborhood is alot more populated residentially so it's actually slower it seems.

OP is moving to a pretty remote area, I would guess it's gonna be DSL because it will be based off the infrastructure of existing telephone lines, which that far north might be a bit dated, would explain why 10M is the max speed.

~~I imagine the cap on bandwidth might be about 40-80GBs~~. Sorry OP, didn't see the 20 GB part, you might want to inquire about paying a flat fee for unlimited bandwidth, most Canadian ISP's will have such an option.  Even just Jets games you will probably go over, and you have to take into account youtube, netflix etc.

You are 100% right, that is the concern, one game and his entire months bandwidth could be gone.

And most ISP's won't tell you you are close or over, I got dinged with that myself before several times, and mostly with streams as the reason after I cut the cord on TV."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Someone posted on here earlier that Mayweather made more money every 20 seconds of the fight than Russell Wilson will make all year.

That being said, that fight just killed boxing for the foreseeable future"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This was the one that came to mind for me right away.

TJ hit FA, and I remember the Eagles fan base, desperate as we were since TO left for a good WR, were clamoring for TJ.

The guy did put up big numbers in Cincy, but this is the story to point at that always be weary of a guy opposite another elite WR.  Makes me think of this offseason with Cobb, I like Cobb a lot and not bashing him, but he is not a #1, that's just not him."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I dunno man, there is quite a bit of smoke for there to be no fire at this point.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Nope, they don't, it's not all about skill or ""who is the best"", there is so much more that goes into it.

Like look at Tanny's guarantee, $46M.  Rodgers is at $57M....

Wilson, Luck and Cam's agent now have HUGE leverage.

Shit man, Bradford's agent if he balls out this year too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ah ok, couldn't remember what game it was from, but what a sick run"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Haha I guess that would be true if things go exactly the same 1979-1985.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And going to court for what?

This whole thing doesn't fall under a court of law jurisdiction, Brady is contracted by the NFLPA, who has a CBA with the NFL, that investigation and punishment is handled with the league.

Can no one answer *what* they would be going to court for?  "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Everyone hates the Pats, wahhhhhh"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Honestly, who cares they are internet points, but how uninformed they are is tantamount to dark ages witch hunts, no proof needed"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And I think it did filter down to guys like Asante, that being a great corner didn't mean you had to tackle.

But Deion's covering skills, unmatched, even by guys like Revis.  He had the speed and the skills, many guys are fast, but not many can combine it with the intelligence needed to be a great CB like Deion."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Don't you think he would have just given up his phone in the first place?

They offered to do everything in front of him and his lawyer, and with Brady's supervision and that they would only review things related to the case...

Brady refused...

Now he'll be ready and willing?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Someone say something even if completely factual, that may be construed in even the most obscure way that it might be negative to the Pats and get down voted for no reason at all!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,No thanks
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"More complete than Denver?  Seattle?  GB?

I like Gregory, but he's gonna have to significantly get his weight up and keep it up in order to be a 4-3 end, NFL tackles will abuse him with his hand in the dirt at 235.  Let's not overplay that he's got a lot of work to do, he didn't drop soley for the weed dude.

Jones....I'm not super impressed with Jones as a CB (I've always maintained that).  He's got a lot of work to do too.

Decent?  You have career backups and a guy who has been averaging like 3 YPC.  Don't just blame the Raider OL or whatnot, because it's on him too.

Very good LB's?  Dunno about that."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No one handles the media better than him.

Popovich is a close second, but Pop is a bit more direct about his disdain, Pop is kind of like a cross between BB and Chip Kelly when it comes to media."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""On paper""

Lol

McFadden/Randle/Dunbar &gt; Barber/Jones/Choice....that's rich

Romo is just magically better, had nothing to do with completely changing the run/pass ratio, he's just magically better.

The defense will just be magically better too.  For some reason, God knows it defies logic, but they will

The OL weren't good.  Jut Pro Bowlers, and considered with the Jets and Vikings to be the best OL's in the league, they sucked tho right?  Romo's never had it so good!!!!

Yes, you don't seem to know anything, you seem like you looked up some stats and thought that made you have big boy pants. 

Better luck next time bud"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Jags vs Buccs
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Isn't that pretty much the definition of abusive....

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Gio is undraftable for me right now.  Hill is iffy.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Court for what?  I see this thrown out wildly now by Pats fans.

What exactly would they be going to court for?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dude, in those years, the Cowboys OL was elite, had 3 Pro Bowlers....

Cowboys were considered to have one of the top OL's in football back then, but like the Eagles now, they were just getting older.  However they were still a really good OL.

Not to mention, he had TO back then, and in his prime Witten.  Then moved on to Austin who was really good back then too.

I know it seems to be a common theme amongst Cowboys fans that Romo and the gang has never had a good OL until now etc, but that's just not true at all."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"PM

Guys got records to solidify in what is most likely his last season."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh get over yourself jesus.  Just saying he's good.  What is with people on here, always in battle mode.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,You know the Patriots existed before BB became the coach right?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Am I or was I in two, one yesterday and one today and you are pretty much making the rest up?

Get over yourself and quit being such a coward about it too, you don't like don't read.  No need to make up that I'm ""in every thread""

Literally him and I had one conversation, yesterday....in a generic thread not even about either team...so, pre tell, unless you scoured my profile for your assumptions, do tell how you come to this conclusion?

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Friday Night Lights was pretty good.

Any Given Sunday is a bit over the top, but still pretty good.

Rudy probably takes it for me, that kid had so much heart!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I would assume there is a PR aspect of not doing it too.  

Most 7th rounders don't amount to much, but hey, you never know.  I guess teams figured why take a shot on a guy that said he wouldn't play, and also facilitate his plan of not playing so he can get drafted next year.

Still think he ends up in NO if this whole investigation turns him out clean, but I'm sure pretty much every team will be after him if it does pan out that way."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"These guys will literally grasp at anything at this point, validity not needed "

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Me too bro, me too"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"So more speculation then....

You interpreted a random tweet as ""they are going to court""

That's what you took from that?  A tweet from Schefter is your smoking gun that they are going to court?

Again, you guys think the NFL doesn't have ace lawyers?  This multi billion dollar enterprise?

And again, what would they be going to court for?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol thanks for the heads up

And I don't doubt you guys"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You cold man, ice cold."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Don't forget about tampering with radio communication systems so they could relay information to Brady past the 15 second cutoff and into the play
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'd give it to Dez now, I'd also put Julio over him at this point too.

He's still great, but he's on the downslope of his prime."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I already did, go back and read

You are just irritating at this point because you are in a bunch because my answer wasn't the one you wanted.

LOL  

Get lost bandwagon"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"He said ""Mark Sanchez will start the whole season""

He was asked what information he was basing that on

He said, because he's missed a bunch of games and has knee troubles and hasn't played in awhile.

I don't see the connection.  Could Bradford get hurt again?  Sure he could.  Is there any indication that Bradford won't play the entire year yet or is not on the same recovery path he's always been on?  None that I've seen.

Maybe he has inside information that we don't...
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Are our changes regression though?

There aren't any positions where you could say we got *weaker* other than maybe RG, and the way our blocking scheme works it's more about the T's than anything else.

Change yes, regression would signify we got weaker at positions....that's not really the case is it?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well Matt Schaub also has better production than Joe Montana

So, Schaub &gt; Montana?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But, but, Bradley Fletcher will be good now because Patz

INB4 ""it's da same az Chungggg"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Cary had 6 DPI/holding/illegal contacts, and Fletcher had 4 PI's, but [actually had 8 that cost yardage including holds and illegal blocks](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FletBr99/penalties/2014/)

It's gonna be interesting to see what BB goes to considering it's risky to have Chung deep in C2, and it's risky to play Fletcher in C3 (we played a lot of C1/C3)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Proof that media can spin an already hyper sensitive group of people very easily is more accurate.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Pats lost in 1996 to the Packers and in 1985 to the Bears.

Their only wins are in the BB era...and how *some* feel about *some* of those wins, well that's a different discussion.

Cowboys won in 1992, 1993 and 1995.  Cowboys also had their run starting in 1966-1983 where they only missed the playoffs twice in that period, and made 5 SB's and won 2, and made a ton of conference championships too.
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Just a word of advice on the Wire, don't get discouraged in season 2, it kind of drags a bit, but it picks right back up after that, and plot points in seasons 2 are important for the rest of the series.

It's well worth the watch."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Because vision helps you find the path of least resistance, allowing you to break tackles easier?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Whoever he is, I'm sure Dan Snyder paid him a lot then had 2nd thoughts about it later"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Warner is a bit different I think because he went through that lull where he was a backup in the middle of his career.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,Slow and tall

ImTheOnlyChipHere,Lol Steelers were the king of the bubble screen for a long time there
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"They were Top 5 in 08, I remember because most of the year it was the Giants/Redskins/Cowboys flipping all around between 4-6.  The entire NFC East had Top D's.

Giants may have edged them out at the end of the year, but Boys were Top 5 for a lot of the year.  Steelers were 1st all year, Ravens 2nd, Eagles 3rd, the other three were rotating in and out of the other spots.  Titans were up there too IIRC."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'l take the DL for sure, gotta stop the run and the pass.

Look at the dominant defenses of the past 15 years, you see a ton of Casey Hamptons, Brett Kiesels, Vince Wilforks, Richard Seymours, Jay Ratliff's, Haloti Ngata's etc, and that's just for 3-4.

For 4-3, DL for sure, 2009 Vikings.  The rest of the defense was alright, nothing crazy, Winfield was elite, but it was alright,  but that DL was beast.  2008 Titans as well.  And of course we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the Giants, who's rotational Nascar was essentially Jim Johnson's Eagles defense, which was the big reason why the Eagles had a good D for a long time in the mid to late 2000's.

Heck I just posted in another thread, Eagles from last year being 2nd in sacks....no damn way we are close to even Top 10 without Fletcher Cox doing what he did.

It all starts up front."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Tell us how much Tony Romo costs next!
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No it's just you guys, Pats fans all got legal degrees a week ago from NESN U"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh I thought they would put it at the bottom, my mistake.

I like to get a laugh out of this as much as anyone, but even I can admit this one is going a bit far on the leagues official site.

The PSI thing, this, what's next, these things usually come in 3's.  NFL is flexing the muscle today.

This reminds me of a place I used to work, the 2nd in command guy always used to underhandedly try and make his own decisions after our boss had already decreed what was gonna happen.  One day the boss called a meeting and very clearly stated ""I'm Daddy."""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Shocking
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Revis and Rodgers for me.

Having Revis adds so many more pages to your playbook.

Rodgers just seems like he's not even trying to be awesome sometimes, like it's just so effortless"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,They have everything but QB....it's a shame really.
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes I think it would have for sure.

Walsh changed the league on so many levels.  Does he get the same rope from anyone but DeBartolo?  DeBartolo was a very demanding owner, and I think that played a big part in the 49er/Walsh's success as well.  Does Walsh become the same guy?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Haha yes they do, just seems there are tons of people that think the respect that Watt gets is circle jerk.  Like it's just because he has sacks, which is totally not the case at all."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"In addition to the obvious Seahawks answer, we also have the 2005 Steelers to point at too.

And even though a majority of NE fans for some reason think Tom Brady was the reason they won all the early SB's, the 2004 team ran the ball more than they threw it, and the 2001 and 2003 teams were pretty close to being even too.  Basically they won they same way the Seahawks did, great defense and great run game even if newer NE fans wanna pretend Brady did it all back then.

The answer really is, yes, if you have an elite defense, and the combination of the two allows you to control the clock."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think it would be crazy to trade within the division post FA and draft, but then again, Chip doesn't exactly play by the traditional norms.

Can point to the McNabb trade, but the rumor there was part of the motivation to move him to the Skins was so the Skins wouldn't take a QB in the draft.  Dunno if that's true, but it's out there.

I can't see Reese wanting to part with much for him considering his age and contract (and the fact that he wants a bigger contract as is, thats the only reason Mathis is even ""on the block"" as is, whatever team he goes to is gonna have to give him more money).  

For something like a 5th, with our own OL issues, I don't think it would be worth it for us, especially to help a division rival."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"As if Brady never lobbied for rule changes

As if we didn't see Brady crying for flags 500 different times as a result of these rules

I remember once I ran 4 plays for the whole half, just sat in the pocket and ran out the clock on two of them with no pass rush.

I thought I heard they got rid of that in M15?  What do people do now?"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Exactly, Wilkerson is easily 2nd behind Watt.  And I'm an Eagles fan who loves Fletch, but I can admit Wilk is probably better.

And as the market has shown, elite interior DL get paid more than pass rushers do.  I don't think teams just do that for the hell of it, it suggests teams value this position more."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think it's a lot easier for a ref to see defensive stuff though, because typically there are jersey tugs and such.

They allow jostling, but the mileage seems to vary ref to ref.  WR's know what they can get away with, in the Eagles/Colts game the Eagles DB's said TY was flopping all game long trying to get calls, and on the ""PI"" that was ""uncalled"" it's pretty obvious that TY is flopping for a call when you see it broken down.

Just a lot of inconsistency if anything."

If he repeats his production after teams can now game plan for him, adjust scheme for him, and had a whole offseason to do so. sure, he's worthy.

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Matthews made the comment about being the (or rather not being) #1 in more the context of unselfishness and being a team player vs. Chip told him he's not gonna be outside.  He is 6'3, so he has the size.  I know he started out in slot for us (and played a lot of slot at Vandy), but take like Jordy, he started out in slot too, also 6'3.

Chip hasn't really said anything yet, but I imagine he's gonna be getting a lot of targets no matter where he actually lines up (granted, this also depends on the chemistry him and Bradford develop too).

Agholor won't be given anything, Chip has made it very clear (see Marcus Smith especially) that being the 1st round pick doesn't guarantee you anything, you've gotta earn that every week in practice and on the field."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The courts would have to accept the case first of all though, and take CBA language that investigations and punishment are designed to be taken internally.

It's not like they wouldn't ask why they refused further interviews, why was Brady un co-operative with the phone thing.  I mean Brady isn't obligated to give his phone, but they did set ground rules as to what they would go through, and offered that everything would be done in front of him and his council.

And in regards to the defamation, I agree, that's pretty much what I said.  I can't see from a fans point of view why a defamation suit is something a fan would be excited over....as a fan, don't you just want his suspension reduced?  A defamation suit will not do that for you.  And yes, I do believe Kraft would have weight on this, he can't mandate what Brady does or does not do for that, but I would assume he would have an opinion on it to share with Brady.

I think people got so worked up by media that Brady has these awesome lawyers that it's spun into ""we are going to court"", when more likely is this guy was hired to work on his appeal internally."

This is a silly debate, and you are acting like I badmouthed LT.  I didn't.  Don't be such a homer"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Were all of his 10+ carry games in blowouts?

In regards to this specific example, think of the Patriots game.  They were blowing out the Colts too, Colts were selling out on the run then too, Cowboys have a better OL than the Patriots, and like Randle, Gray hadn't seen much action until then either

It's just a factor of the discussion, not the whole discussion.  What else should we use to project, hopes and dreams?  Games where he used as a spell back and had 3 carries and busted one for 30?

Darren Sproles also had a high YPC as a spell, but you can bet your last dollar he couldn't be used as a 15-20 carry back."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"8 out of 50 dude....if he dropped 16 out of 100, I mean you wouldn't be like ""oh ffs"".  Smith dropped 10 on 134 last year, 2nd highest for a guy with over 100 targets...there weren't moments where you were like ""oh come onnnnnn man"".

I don't overestimate mental issues for things that are split second things like catching a football running full speed.

Brady was asked repeatedly in that presser about ball pressure etc, Brady answered numerous times ""I've never thought about ball pressure/air pressure ever after I've selected the balls, never given it another thought etc""....did Tom just totally forget these balls from the Jets game in this presser?  Underinflated, overinflated, whatever it's still ball pressure and he didn't appear to like it...yet he said he's never thought about it and it's never been an issue ever, like 10 times too?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"But is he just an idiot?  Him and his agent don't know his value?  It was no secret Revis was gonna be wanting more than PP, RS and JH.

If CHJ is just as good, and 5 years younger, does that make any sense to you at all?  This kid just short changed himself on $20-30M?  Does that sound realistic to you he just loves Denver that much?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Like I said, there were bouncing all around that year, but they were ranked at 4 for awhile I remember, Giants and Skins bouncing in and out of that spot too.

Point is, they had a really good D in those years, I don't think it can be argued that the 2014/2015 Cowboy D is or will be as good.  That really just discredits how good that D was, I realize we all wanna be homers, but let's pepper in some realism too.

And Gregory, Jones and Collins seem like a good haul, but right now, in May, you'd be hard pressed to find any fan base not thinking that their Top hauls from the draft aren't gonna be great and game changing.  When in reality, even the 1st round has like a 40% bust rate.  We can't really just claim Gregory is gonna be better than anyone on those D's with no basis to do so, I'm sure back then you could find Cowboys fans high on Bobbie Carpenter too, that he was gonna make the D awesome."

You can trade up like the Jets did with Revis, or the Steelers with Polamalu and end up with an absolute stud.

Jimmy Johnson said that you are gonna miss on picks, you know you will, but the more picks you have, the more chances you have of hitting was his thinking, more room for error.  But Jimmy Johnson also had more trades in the draft back when he was putting that team together than the entire league combined...

Of course you have to combine this with knowing what type of guys you want for your team as well."

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Didn't he suffer a bad injury last year?

They have him on the cheap for what, two more years still?  Cro is on the wrong side of 30 (but played very well last year for a guy who is), and easily cut after this year IIRC too, and Revis although still very much the best CB in the NFL, also isn't a spring chicken anymore either.

I mean on paper, signing Skrine, Revis and Cro it looks that way, but why would you?  I know this regime didn't draft him, but didn't he show promise when he was playing before the injury?  There was little chance he was ever gonna live up to the ""Revis' replacement"" hype, but why cut him now while he's still cheap?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And for 2015, new and improved MMA Lane Johnson."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, that's why they got kicked out of Lambeau in 2006, then weaseled around to another area after being kicked out, and had to be kicked out again.

It's ok, I expected as much."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"$20-30M???  C'mon, this is a big reach here.  This is his one big chance at a contract, most CB's get one big one.  You realistically think this conversation happened:

Agent: CHJ, you are as good as Revis, and better than Haden and Peterson for sure, just as good as Sherman.  You gonna get paid son

CHJ: I don't care, I just love Denver so much, OMGz it's so great here, here's a blank contract, just tell Elway to fill it in with whatever he wants!!

Agent: CHJ, you realize you can get crazy guaranteed money right?  Even if you want Denver, you are one of the best and you are young.

CHJ: I don't care, Denver is da best, so good I wanna give a 40% discount!!!

And that's a token player speech, c'mon.  I'm sure Revis went back to NY because he just lovvvesss NY too.

I'm sure he liked being a Jet too, but he liked his $70M and proper market value too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Perfect title lol
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I got in a pretty silly one the other day, we were talking about how there are parallels between Ben/Steelers and Wilson/Seahawks in terms of Wilson's upcoming contract.

Another guy said that it's not the same situation because Ben has always been elite his whole career, and Ben has unique ability to escape in the pocket (like Wilson doesn't...).  He also said that Ben took discounts and Wilson is being greedy (Ben's guarantee in 2008 was behind only PM)

It turned out he was a Pats fan, and he went on these diatribes about how Brady takes 50% less than the top paid QB's (he basically cherry picked out Brees vs Brady this year, not taking timing of contract signings, and not taking restructures into account), and that Brady took so much less it allowed the Pats to sign Revis, Browner etc....as if there is no other team in the NFL that has ever done this....

I didn't even know where to start.  It's so apparent some people haven't watched football for long and don't understand a lot about the multiple layers of contracts "

On one hand, both got to throw GW TD's at the end of SB's that will live in highlight glory forever.

Both were brought to their 1st SB's on the backs of great defenses and strong running games.

Both were on teams that squeezed into the playoffs as a WC and won it all.

Ben I might give the slight edge too because in say like 2008, his OL was friggin awful.  Like really, really bad.  And he played with a bad OL for *years*."

Just cuz a guy left doesn't mean his importance and talent has to be downplayed big time.  Losing Maclin sucked for us, he's a good player who was a key part of our offense."

Poor you Adrian and your $15M you get for 2015?  How dare you be dealt with for beating your 4 year old son over something stupid?  How dare the Vikings want you to get your millions still?

Garrett has been OC for a long time, he's been the play caller for a very long time, as OC and HC.

Murray's YPC during the years you mentioned was still pretty high, his career is like 4.8....I disagree that the Cowboys had a bad OL and this is why they didn't run the ball more."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Texans this week huh...cool, enjoy."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And that was the desired effect of propagating that information at that specific juncture

Population opinion control 101: media"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No I'm taking just this past year into account too.  And the year before that.  Recent years, as well as years prior.

DeSean missed games, had crap QB's, sub par OL, and still put up big numbers.  He beat some of the best CB's in the game last year too, had a big play for a TD on Sherman/Thomas, and burned Patrick Peterson like nobodies business."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Speaking of blocking schemes and a bit off topic, looking forward to seeing the Shanahan blocking scheme in relation to Coleman/Freeman.

I know it's quite early, but any buzz on who will be getting more of the carries?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Normal Irving guarding Curry I'm be concerned with, but injured-has-to-go-through-another-series-first Irving guarding Curry, very concerning.  And yes I'm assuming that the Warriors are gonna run through Houston/LA

And yea, Shump and JR have really stepped up.

I'd love to see Cleveland take it though, would make a great story for sure and give one of the best fan base in sports a title."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"See, we told you all we upgraded at QB"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Those players gave up and there were a lot of weakness'.  In the Falcons game it was like they were a JV team, just abused.  The final score isn't even indicative of just how bad it was, Buccs got some garbage time points, but it was a complete and utter domination.

McCoy and David are studs, Verner is good.  Outside of that, yikes."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Explain

And remember football has three phases"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Dude, you don't have defend your LS pick to me.  I feel like it's a silly conversation.

Just saying we love Dorenbos, he's been on the team forever and he's actually a really good dude."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Wilson's ability to extend plays and escape pressure, and also his threat as a runner gives him an edge for sure.  Tanny can be mobile too, but not on the level of Wilson.

And Wilson's accuracy and arm strength is a bit underrated, he can drop them in, and deep too.  His reads and progressions could be a bit better, but he is a 3rd year QB, that kind of stuff comes with time too."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Really, dude there was this one study of his 2012 or 2013 season, studied every game and every play, whether it be man or zone.

He's really fucking good dude, if I can find the link again I'll post it.

Personally Revis is number one for me, but I'm a bit biased towards man corners myself.

But I'd take him over any of those guys, and I think all three of them are great too.  Sherman is a beast though, there is a reason why even elite QB's stay away from him.

In Cover 3 it's not like he has two safeties bracketing with him, that's very far from the truth"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Good, that's called ""progress"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, everyone hates the Pats, stick with that.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Maybe not, but we are probably guaranteed to see their floor in Week 2 and Week 9."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Just Nick doing Nick things
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I like Benjamin, but look at the targets as well, the catches and the TD's.

It's debatable "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Artist: Hot Leg

Song: You can't hurt me anymore

In honor of: half our team"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,QB for sure.  They still have a good team otherwise.  Especially if Clowney becomes who he was thought to be (even with the surgery)
ImTheOnlyChipHere,That's nice
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"However, couldn't you make the arguement to follow the money in terms of value?

Who had the biggest contracts in FA over the past bit?

Suh and Haynesworth.  Heck, look at Haynesworth vs Peppers contracts.  Haynesworth had him by like $25M.

Is it really more valuable?  The money doesn't suggest

If Houston wasn't franchised, would he have gotten more than Suh?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EFZelyPpdg

Bryant was a pretty good WR who just couldn't stay consistent, and had off the field problems IIRC as well

But when he was on, he was one the better WR's in the league"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I picture him during the draft, seeing all the sheep praise absolutely anything he does:

BB: Watch this Robert, I'm gonna take a fucking LS in the 5th who isn't even eligible to play football, and they are gonna call me a genius for it!!  

Kraft: No fuckin way dude

BB: Watch, I'm gonna do it...

*picks up phone*

10 minutes later

Pats brigade: GOAT LS, GENIUS!!!!!

NESN: 40 f'n MPH!!!!!!

Pats fans: HOLY SHIT 40 F'N MPH!!!!!

Kraft: .....I'm speechless

BB: LMAO"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Yes, it's everyone that hates the Patriots lol

Not that they cheated, it's not that we don't like cheating, it's that we secretly hate the Patriots!!

You got us!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's package plays, when we go up to the LOS, the QB has 3 options typically, you see Oregon do the same thing a lot.

For example, there will be a bubble screen, a HB Gut, and a QB Keeper.  The QB reads the defense pre snap, then decide which one gets run.

Sometimes this same ""play"" will be run over and over and over, but it looks different because sometimes they are passing, sometimes they are running etc, but it's essentially the same thing but the QB decides pre snap what is run."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It would take a ton to get fair value for Watkins considering what they just gave up to get him period.

Like Collins and/or Hightower would have to be involved I would think at the very least"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Yea but on top he's got the hair of T Smith's 80 year old grandpa
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Jake.

Fisher."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It was college though, was it illegal there too?  

I honestly don't know myself"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"&gt; multiple super bowls as the leader of his team

Brady in those early years was not much different from say Russell Wilson right now.

Would you say Wilson was the leader who led his team to SB's?  "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Agreed man, that's why I said if he keeps it up.

I think the general public just think he's a sack man, they don't realize the diff between 4-3 DE and 3-4 DE.  Watt lines up everywhere as well, 7 different positions last year.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I'd take Rhodes
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I know, all you heard last year was Pats fans saying how CHJ's PFF ranking was bs blah blah blah, he's nothing compared to Revis, Revis covers all the good WR's and follows them, Talib covers most of the good guys for DEN.

Now that Revis left for a rival, oh well Revis gave up two TD's, he's overrated.  And of course all that other stuff is downplayed.  CHJ is the best now.  Revis is washed up and gives up TD's.

That's why I was making the point earlier about coverage pressure vs pass rush pressure, when you compare NE vs DEN last year, a huge difference there, which definitely factors the CB's too.

Let's also put it this way, if we swap out Revis and CHJ, does BB scheme the same?  Does he trust CHJ consistently on an island so he can have Chung in the box?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Philip Rivers when selected by the Giants had no phone call and said as much on live TV

They were working out the trade with San Diego, but Rivers says he never received any phone call from the Giants to this day."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well this is just common knowledge, everyone knows all teams cheat like crazy, the Pats cheat less than those teams, but the Pats get picked on.

It's because Kraft is not a good host when he has Goodell over for many, many dinners and parties, one time he didn't even serve dessert and Goodell was like ""take the Pats to the woodshed Ted and Troy"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"RB probably could, if its the same blocking scheme.

Or systems that are the same, a QB needs time, but just to use as an example, in 2009 when Favre went to the Vikings, he said the plays and even a lot of the nomenclature was the same as McCarthy.  Like if a RB went from Andy Reids system to Brad Childress', I would assume a lot of the plays and calls and language is the same or very similar like Favre said it was"

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I can envision:

Murray: 250-280

Mathews: 150-180

Sproles: 50-70, and passing downs used in different ways."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Lol was funny when that guy asked a question about conditioning, and Chip cut him off saying ""we don't do that"", and then gives him an extra long stare while processing the next question like ""I'm gonna remember not to answer this mf'ers questions anymore"""
ImTheOnlyChipHere,I said no 4th's!!!
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I actually do think it's a great idea for him, and just so happens, the one spot the Cowboys have ""open"" is RT....

Fuck Dallas"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I like the Powers that have two pulling guards.

There is one run, it's in the Saints playbook, Pistol something, it has three WR's stacked close to the line to the one side, the TE on the other, and it has two pulling OL, it kills against 4-3.  Called Strong Power."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I wouldn't take Cobb or Fitz, Cobb is a slot specialist, an extremely good one mind you, but that's what he is, and he's perfect for GB's system.

Fitz's prime was 7 years ago, dunno why people still think he's top 5, he's not even the number one on his own team.

Again, it's being construed that I ""hate Beckham"", i don't, I think he's good, it's early to put him as Top 5.  We haven't seen consistency.  We haven't seen teams adjust to his tape.
"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It's about cheating on your GF, how is it about winning?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think so too, unless he does a restructure/paycut like Fitz.  "
ImTheOnlyChipHere,LaCanfora does his best Florio impression
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I don't hate the Pats at all, I just don't like stupidity, I don't like that antics of the fan base and made up delusions.  Those are two different things.....now I don't have to tell you specifically what antics I mean do I?  I have tons of respect for the Patriots, have read tons about BB, Seymour is my favorite DL of the 2000's, Harrison was one of my favorite DB's.  I love BB's schemes.  Don't confuse my eye rolling of some of the fan base for a hatred of the team itself.

For the Seahawks.  What is Pete Carrolls specialty?  DB's.  He's a fucking DB master.  Pete Carroll knew the exact thing he wanted in a DB, big, physical, smart. Do you think it's all just great drafting they ended up with most of their guys in the 5th/6th?  No, a huge credit has to go that Pete Carroll knows what he wanted physically out of players, and Pete Carroll is a fucking master at coaching DB's.

As for the Patriots stuff, you totally ignored most of what I said, and I asked what info you were basing it from, and still no answer.

Don't forget to down vote me rather than have a conversation tho bud, that's productive."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"This isn't an American court of law, why can't people understand that.  

They don't need this smoking gun, if you want reading material to refer too, refer to the NFLPA and NFL's agreement when it comes to investigations and punishment of which.

You guys are acting like they need to see Brady delafting the balls himself, they don't.  This isn't a court of law, this is his employer."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Hmm
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Can you elaborate why?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"[Or this play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYH6PPYaPI)

That's Randy Moss in all his glory to me, the vision of his twitch reactions, the agility of his dodging and hurdling, then the uncatchable breakaway speed at the end.  

And it doesn't even have his absolutely insane ability for multi covered jump balls either, also something he is arguably the best at ever.

Most talented WR ever IMO, too bad be didn't have the attitude to match it for his whole career."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"It definitely does require a QB with an understanding of defenses pre snap, because the QB decides what play is gonna be run.

It's not a traditional ""call the play in and run that one"" offense."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Why are people down voting a guy saying thanks?

I mean really, he's saying thanks, you make sure you get those Jets fans though guys, that'll show him!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Here is [a bunch](http://www.prideofdetroit.com/2015/1/4/7492057/lions-cowboys-refs-flag-pass-interference/in/7223260) of different [examples with gif's...](http://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2015/1/4/7491493/cowboys-lions-final-score-detroit-dallas-playoffs-24-20)

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Whattt??  But in Spygate they only filmed that one game, just the one....according to all the Pats fans anyway.

NVM that in 2006 the Packers had to kick a Patriot cameraman out of the stadium not just once, but found him filming again later in the game and had to kick him out again.

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And that's why I said ""if he continues what he's doing"".  I mean I don't think anyone felt he would continue doing what he did after that rookie year, that was insane what he did.  And yet, he has kept doing it lol, and against worse odds if anything (teams can scheme for his tape now, and he gets doubled and tripled more now)

Don't worry bro, i get what you are saying, not just doing recency bias here, been watching the game for a long time, I don't throw stuff out like that easily without regard to history myself.

I just think he is that damn good, but he does have a lot of career to go.  Not disrespecting guys like White, Taylor, Sanders, Smith etc in anyway here."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I still think he would have, he was playing out of system with the Jets, and he wanted to go to Minny all along to rub it in TT's face.  And Childress and McCarthy, and Holmgren for that matter, all pretty much ran the same system

TT had to put that clause in about trading him to the NFC North when he was moved to the Jets"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"[Bro, he's a mobile QB](http://www.andrewishak.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cam-newton-laptop.png)"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I dunno dude, I think on that one, we also have to consider that, this is by far not the first time Mort has been caught spinning out things that weren't true....is it he's getting bad leaks, or is that Mort might just be full of shit and trying to stay relevant in a climate where he falls further and further into irrelevance with each passing year as it relates to his role as an ""insider"" breaking news.  There is a whole webpage showing how many false reports Mort has put out into the world, this is far from the first.

As far as the phone, from a legal strategic POV, it would be poor strategy to not give it at the beginning, and looking ahead to a  long game in civil court, where it would receive no protections like the ones the Wells team offered.  How could he prefer that?

Now Don Yee, despite being a lawyer, doesn't appear to be the smartest guy, maybe that's the issue.  I mean all his shit talking of the NFL before the verdict came on punishment, not the best strategic move."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"No idea really, but I was hoping we'd get him, seemed like the 49ers turned that card in within like 20 seconds lol.  Was surprised Odigi fell as far as he did too.

Bowman was expected to go in the early to mid 3rd IIRC, we needed an ILB at the time, I didn't expect him to turn quite as good as he has, but he was from our backyard, and we selected like 5 picks before you guys (and took a bust who hardly ever played)."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Sorry we aren't counting Madden XP in the context of this discussion
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I'd call it more up-tempo vs no huddle.

No huddle can also include like Peyton Manning offenses, and a lot of times he's doing it to prevent you from subbing, to confuse you on defense, to not let *you* huddle, try and get a penalty out of a substitution while you are running off the field etc....but he'll still mostly take his 40 seconds to do it.

We are trying to snap the ball as fast as we can, and a lot of times aren't even changing the call, we are running ""package plays"", which is essentially several plays in the same play, the QB just decides which one gets run.  Like for example, we'll have the same formation, over and over, but there will be like 3 options, a HB gut, a WR screen, and a QB keeper, and we'll run that same thing like 5 times in a row, it's just up to the QB which one is gonna be run by what he see's on defense before the snap, and the coaching staff wants that decision made ASAP.  A lot of times we'll snap the ball with 35 or like 30 seconds still left on the play clock.

Might be splitting hairs there, but I think there is a bit of a difference there.  And in both cases, success depends on the intelligence level and skill of the QB."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Maybe we'll just sign RW instead :p
ImTheOnlyChipHere,LOL
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"The curse of letting Brian Dawkins walk, we still feeling that shit 6 years later."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Jake Fisher wasn't a project tackle

ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh Romo get's blame bro, no TD's, and INT's and fumbles.  And on that Leber INT, he had tons of time, he just threw a really, really stupid pick.

Don't blame the OL for losing to Jared Allen at the peak of his powers, the man was unstoppable.  They had the best DL in the NFL and it wasn't even close."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"""Been"" starters....could name you tons of guys who have ""been"" starters.

Cassell had one decent year in KC...

Hoyer just benched and let go in his only year starting...

Mallet we know nothing about, what player that we don't know much about and haven't seen play much doesn't have ""upside""?

Kliff Kingsbury - who?

Kevin O'Connell

Zac Robinson

In 15 years he's had one guy outside of Brady who churned out one good season really...one out of 6, one season. 

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"On a whole 51 attempts, [good for him](http://www.gifgifgifgifgif.com/gif/5950.gif)

I mean it's not like he didn't do 3.0 the year prior or anything....

And that other new guy you signed, he's getting better too, he went from 3.3 YPC in 2013 *and* 2012....to 3.**4**YPC in 2014!!!  And his only year playing a full schedule too!!  Awesome!!!!"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"You said it didn't *sound* like he'll be ready.

You were asked what information you were basing this from, because it sounded like you were *hearing* things

Then you just said it's because he's missed games before.

Is this something you just heard recently that he missed games?  I'm not following here..."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Uhm, that's not exactly wrong.

You gonna draft Julius Thomas high in fantasy this year?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Well there aren't a lot of NT's making big dollars, there aren't really any elite 34 NT's in the league that aren't under rookie deals anyway.

So if you take it as a basic two interior and two edge, it has balance."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I have a lot of respect for Brown, don't get me wrong, his route running is friggin outstanding.  

I just like how Dez can be used in anyway really, redzone, deep threat, over the middle threats, great hands, non stop motor....just a personal preference maybe, and I'm an Eagles fan who hates the Boys, but no bias here."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Still can't answer huh?

Had like 10 Pats fans here, one answered defamation, which would be crazy for Brady to do and has no chance of reducing his suspension either, the other 9 couldn't answer, including you.

Just a lot of speculation and dodging.

Good chat bud, better luck next time"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,One of the best in the game today without a doubt
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Patriots doing everything awesome, ask their fans most of whom weren't even watching during the first 3 SB wins...

Everyone is jelly, and all this is just a conspiracy to bring them down cuz dey are sooooooooo good"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Oh god, go away troll boy, did mommy not love you enough or something

I don't respect your opinions, they are baseless and just bad

Byyyyyeeeee"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Nitpick much?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Not what I asked.

No one covers in man like Revis.  No one mirrors like him.

Everyone gets beat on occasion, Watt gets blocked on occasion.

Just because he's the best doesn't mean he NEVER gets beat, that's a silly argument.  Deion Sanders got beat too, he's still probably the best cover corner ever."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Buck?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"I think he's gonna have a big year.

Word is he's been working out like he has something to prove"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,Who would you put above him?
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Didn't Wharton just retire last year too?  I don't think that LT is the only position the Panthers could do with an upgrade on that OL.

I realize you guys are defending the picks because it's your team, but c'mon."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Foles is not a Top 10 QB when healthy.

Don't just go by stats here, you are leaving a TON of context out here, and also leaving his 2014 season out of it.

I'm sorry brother, but you don't seem informed."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"And it also just assumes that every team is running the same schemes, and practice and coach the same way to do the same things.

The NFL isn't linear like that."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Couldn't we say the same of Romo, Brees etc

The Fins moved his cap around to be the biggest hit in 2016, this is not exactly uncommon."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Ohhh, good one!!!!!!

"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Find me one RB in the NFL you can't find a little thing to nitpick, a few plays that are negatives...

You know that Aaron Rodgers guy, or that Tom Brady guy, they threw some INT's.  I guess that means they are bad and left too much meat on the bone?"
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Just want to actually talk football sometimes, not about peoples butthurt feelings."
ImTheOnlyChipHere,"Murray &gt; underwear thief and highly drafted RB bust

Good luck with 8-8 Tony back as the main fixture as the offense"
Mclovin_21,No. McCarthy completely broke down all of Rodgers throwing motions and mechanics and made them what they are today (pretty much perfect). McCarthy is an incredibly big part of the reason why Aaron Rodgers is so good.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah but you're not going around saying ""omg we beat Slater we're so good"". You're bragging about beating a hobbled LoB on a neutral field."
Mclovin_21,I daresay that Alex Smith got thrown into the worst situation of any top QB prospect in recent memory.
Mclovin_21,If they wanted a strong safety then maybe yeah. Weddle is better though.
Mclovin_21,It's probably gonna be the fucking pacers or something.
Mclovin_21,"Oh okay, haha. I get you now."
Mclovin_21,He's still playing.
Mclovin_21,"Your're fucking delusional if you think Russell Wilson is the reason you guys made the SB. The difference is we played you guys at home, against your defense, and Aaron Rodgers is the best QB in the NFL the rest of the time. We went 2-5-1 without him, you guys got 3 wins *maybe* because of Wilson."
Mclovin_21,"I was assuming Aaron Rodgers would play for a few more years. But w/e, argue semantics instead of actually contributing."
Mclovin_21,It makes me giddy that other people recognize that he looks like he could be special.
Mclovin_21,I know. He actually doesn't throw a crazy amount for how often he throws.
Mclovin_21,"Nah, Shields *maybe* top 15, but he's too inconsistent. He could move up next year. But yeah I forgot about Talib and trufant and a couple others"
Mclovin_21,Alright fair enough.
Mclovin_21,"Aaron Rodgers.

Mike McCarthy and Brandon Bostick. Not cool."
Mclovin_21,She's pretty damn hot I must say.
Mclovin_21,I wasn't even the one who brought up. I get that bandwagoners have to stick together and all but geez...
Mclovin_21,"Watching tape is subjective, they sensationalize certain players, discriminate against others. Some of them are just flat out wrong. PFF is only good as a general indicator of skill level, nothing more."
Mclovin_21,"I dream of the day the Packers defense shuts someone out again. I don't think our scheme works very well for that, cause after the half Capers goes full on prevent defense."
Mclovin_21,That's ignorant...
Mclovin_21,Except the tuck rule was a shit call in an actual game and this is all Pats fans bitching about how TB didn't cheat when he obviously did. Way different.
Mclovin_21,That's horrible...
Mclovin_21,"Actually your entire career is over because your trial was handled poorly and everyone hates you! All for one drunken mistake! So great, right?"
Mclovin_21,"Uh, yeah. Let's see. 0 points in the entire first quarter before the lane injury, then after that the patriots magically start doing okay on offense! Simon got picked on all game, he's the reason you won."
Mclovin_21,"Hayward might not even end up on the outside. And if we switch to more cover 3 the roles will be even more mixed. But as it is with Hayward in the slot he's the best slot corner in the NFL. I was just talking about pure hypotheticals, with the way the rest of our secondary is playing we just need one of our other 4 DBs to step up and we could be elite."
Mclovin_21,"I don't want to believe anyone is that dumb, or that vocal even though they know nothing."
Mclovin_21,We do it as long as it's not about the Vikings.
Mclovin_21,WR in the third. Bad pick. No TT apologizers gonna convince me otherwise.
Mclovin_21,"Brett Favre. He *was* football to me when I was younger, he's who made me a GB fan."
Mclovin_21,Yeah Rollins is my favorite pick from the draft. So hyped on that guy. The stuff he did in college in his first year of collegiate play is insane. I'm trying to curb my enthusiasm but I could easily see him as our next Charles Woodson (obviously I'm too psyched up on him).
Mclovin_21,"Nah he's underrated. All you ever hear is ""Hur dur PP so overrated he was horrible this year worst corner in the league."" He had a down year but was still really good, no one puts him in their top 5 anymore but he still is."
Mclovin_21,I honestly think we'd be talking HoF for Rivers if McCree hadn't fumbled in 2006.
Mclovin_21,"Man, Jordan dunking on Brett Favre for the win in the final moments of the world series was heartbreaking."
Mclovin_21,"Oh well I meant the belt celebration he doesn't do every time. Of course he celebrates, everyone does."
Mclovin_21,"Oaky, but it still doesn't show him as cooperative."
Mclovin_21,"I said nearish. I don't think he's gonna be a hall of famer. But you can be a GOAT player without being a GOAT athlete. That's just a dumb thing to say. Jerry Rice wasn't the best athlete ever, still the GOAT. Ray Lewis wasn't the best athlete, still the GOAT. Plenty of great players, including corners and safeties, have been great players without being the best athletes ever."
Mclovin_21,"I mean, first QB to ever throw 4000 yards, won a SB in the biggest upset in sports history, multiple accolades, *made* the AFC. The list goes on."
Mclovin_21,"""They're just entertainers"""
Mclovin_21,"Probably about equal. I think Rodgers skill level is ahead of Andrew Luck just enough that it overrides the age. Neither team would want to make the trade though, but I think they could just do straigth up Luck for Rodgers. A year from now? Maybe not."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, no one likes the Panthers!"
Mclovin_21,"Only receiving duo to ever have 1200 yards and 12 TDs each, I'd say that's a pretty good duo."
Mclovin_21,Yes it did... D:
Mclovin_21,It's ridiculous how athletic he is. I didn't pay that much attention to him before but he truly seems like Clowney is right now. Maybe the most physically gifted player of his era.
Mclovin_21,Nope. You guys went 11-5. Also your defense jumped from top 10 to top 2 and allowed 5 points less per game. That's a *huge* difference.
Mclovin_21,"Romo, Eli, Frank Gore, Marshawn Lynch. All on the fence, but really at this point unless they do something spectacular none of them should make it."
Mclovin_21,"Morgan Burnett is pretty underrated. Ignoring 2013 he's been a top SS in the league for most of his tenure, and this year he played out of his mind, top 5 easily. I think because he fell off a cliff last season he lost all the recognition he was starting to get but this year he undoubtedly backed up his worst year with what you'd see out of an elite safety. 

I don't think we have a truly overrated player because outside Clay and Rodgers none of our players get that much media attention/attention in general. If I had to say someone though, I guess it would be Matthews, but /r/nfl seems to rate him pretty accurately and recognize that although he's a great pass rushers he's not the best player ever. I do think our sub overrates him (mostly his ability to play inside) a tad though, so there's that."
Mclovin_21,"I think McCourty and that other dude, can't remember his name. Oh and Eric Reid and Bethea are pretty beast. Bethea is the best SS in the league imo."
Mclovin_21,"I feel like Cobb is way too low. I mean, 100? Are a kicker or a rookie LB really better than him? Maybe I'm just a homer."
Mclovin_21,"We were ranked 13th in points scored last year. Now we get Raji back and HaHa has another year under his belt. Still a question mark at ILB though. We have potential to be a top 10 defense, we'll probably be somewhere from 8-14 though."
Mclovin_21,"Zero SB wins without cheating.

No but sersiously it definitely would be a little bit tarnished. But obviously that's only if he had such a large role in it that he got suspended for a season. But I mean still 4 SBs. He'd just be second to Montana for sure to me were that to happen."
Mclovin_21,So good.
Mclovin_21,But TJ Yates won their first ever playoff game for them!
Mclovin_21,"Well Rice is definitely the GOAT, but I think Moss was better."
Mclovin_21,Lol.
Mclovin_21,I was counting this one.
Mclovin_21,I don't really go to other subs nearly as much as this one but still imo /r/nfl is worse than the others. The mods can go a little too nazi sometimes about somewhat vague rules and the community is *very* hiveminded. The massive downvoted to any unpopular opinions (I get that there are exceptions) deter actual discussion and make the sub worse than it could/should be.
Mclovin_21,"Covering the slot is harder. And again, allowed the lowest passer rating of any CB in 5 years, so... He allowed less than 200 yards, zero TDs in the regular season, and not even a single catch the entire postseason. "
Mclovin_21,"1. Packers

2. Fantasy Team

3. Good games

4. Trash talking my friends' teams/fantasy teams

5. Seeing people/teams I hate lose"
Mclovin_21,"It was ridiculous. By the time the playoffs rolled around we literally didn't even have 4 healthy LBs that could play, so we had DEs converting to OLB. Shocked we even almost won the wildcard."
Mclovin_21,"Stafford, but it's pretty close. Though I do think that people vastly overrate how clutch eli is. He's not any more or any less than some of the other ""clutch"" players."
Mclovin_21,That gif makes me lol every time.
Mclovin_21,I mean Drew Brees did exactly the same thing basically. 
Mclovin_21,"He aint in the league anymore but Ray Rice was pretty damn clutch. Hey diddle diddle, Ray Rice up the middle?"
Mclovin_21,No.
Mclovin_21,They had 2800 yards between them
Mclovin_21,Teddy has a million more things going for him on offense than Carr.
Mclovin_21,I'd disagree but I guess you have an argument.
Mclovin_21,"There was a decent gap, but anyway not in the darkest timeline they don't. Like I said, they aren't the same defense without Bowman, even you have to admit that. But it was just a hypothetical anyway."
Mclovin_21,"I want to see a coach with a great, depthy Oline (Cmon, Garrett) whip out his humongous dick and play jumbo all game and absolutely run over everyone. Change the league, man!"
Mclovin_21,Is he being a dick cause he's fed up or is he joking? I honestly can't tell.
Mclovin_21,"Except no other receiver has even topped 17 TDs since 1995. The majority of the top 15 or so single season TD leaders are from before the ""modern"" passing league. The only exceptions are moss himself and Gronk who's a TE."
Mclovin_21,"Or ETIII or Bowman, imo. He wasn't better than any of those players that year."
Mclovin_21,Really? I swear a decent amount of people thought they'd make the playoffs.
Mclovin_21,"Meh, I think it was kinda one sided until the last 5 minutes where Peyton had a crazy almost comeback."
Mclovin_21,Yeah that's fair. Kinda strange how much Chung bounced back.
Mclovin_21,"To be fair, Brown has only been good for 2 years."
Mclovin_21,Throw it up to Randy Moss.
Mclovin_21,Cobb motions out of the backfield.
Mclovin_21,"He got like half the yards in the 6 games where Johnson was hurt. Just because receivers don't get a zillion targets every game doesn't mean they aren't good, just there are other options."
Mclovin_21,RG3
Mclovin_21,Just pray the rest of his team shits the bed like what happened in a certain divisional round in 2011 D:
Mclovin_21,"In Madden once I came back 17 points in the last 3 minutes, ending on a hail mary for 50 yards to kick a field goal and force overtime. First play in overtime I strip sacked the QB and kicked a field goal to win. My greatest ever feat.

Edit: And like Joe Montana and LT combined, leading the game tying drive and then forcing a turnover for the win."
Mclovin_21,AJ Jenkins was pretty good but I don't know if I'd call him a top 3 WR all time.
Mclovin_21,Ouch. At least it's not a Texans flair or something!
Mclovin_21,I'm actually really surprised we were favored in 2010. Especially after the rocky start and all. Though our record that year was definitely not indicative of our actual level.
Mclovin_21,"Harder balls are good for people with big hands, but not all Qbs have huge hands. Most of the QBs in the NFL like the balls less deflated."
Mclovin_21,"ITT: My Team's division.

That said, the NFCN. Best receiver, best Qb, best RB, top 3 Oline, amazing secondary, best receiving overall receiving corps, great Dline, and pretty damn good LB crew."
Mclovin_21,"People saying CJ are crazy. Just because he's physically dominating doesn't mean he doesn't run routes well. He's one of the best route runners in the league. Better than Dez, Julio, DT, Jeffery easily.

Also OBJ is not a top 10 receiver."
Mclovin_21,It's not cheating as long as the refs clear the footballs. He said they almost always take some air out anyway. There is almost no equivalency between the cases. And Brady was given the chance to choose exactly which messages to give to them but still declined.
Mclovin_21,"If only he ever had someone like Titans legend Randy Moss, right?"
Mclovin_21,28 TDs is virtually 30. The point is he's better than half the Qbs in the league.
Mclovin_21,"I was gonna say Donald Driver but then I realized he wasn't active anymore. D: I guess I'd have to say Rodgers. Dude is hilarious, always seems to be having fun. You can tell he's a little cocky but overall seems like a pretty nice, chill guy.

Honorable mention is Tony Romo. He's definitely the kind of guy I'd want to have a beer with."
Mclovin_21,"Smith is in a good place but he still is a 5th rounder. You don't get lucky every year with an All-pro, even though obviously some of it comes from a great coaching staff.

EJ Gaines looks like he has some good potential. He could be pretty good in the future.

My homer pick would probably be Quinten Rollins, we have two of the best DB coaches in the league as well (one for Safeties one for CBs) and he looks like he could be special."
Mclovin_21,"Huh, that's interesting. I never particularly paid attention to him, maybe I will now."
Mclovin_21,"Fuck that. I laughed when Favre threw the game losing int against the Saints. That's one of the best moments ever. The Vikes can pry a Lombardi trophy from my cold, dead hands."
Mclovin_21,They should give it to the last team that beat the Patriots that went to the playoffs!
Mclovin_21,"Alright thanks for the actual statistics! But I still think the broken tackle metric isn't very reliable. It doesn't take into account running styles, Oline, whether it was possible or not, whether you got hit behind or in front of the line of scrimmage."
Mclovin_21,"Look at Revis prime. He just never got thrown the ball, he almost never gets high interceptions."
Mclovin_21,Ask Marlon McCree about that
Mclovin_21,"That's because he was a badger! The first badger in a *long* time that we've drafted, and he was really special at UW. He was also probably one of the best route runners in the draft. We have a right to be excited about that!"
Mclovin_21,Romo. He's a better QB. I think regular season vs playoff performance is dumb anyway.
Mclovin_21,"I mean at worst we have two top 15 receivers and a top 10 RB, at best we have a top 5 reciever, a top 10 receiver, and a top 5 RB with a top 5 Oline and the best QB in football. We also have one of the better secondaries in football and a pretty good Dline. I'd bet money that we win the division quite handily."
Mclovin_21,"No, McCoy is not. He had pretty average numbers for someone who got such a high volume of carries last year. He's not top 3 right now."
Mclovin_21,Why aren't there frogs in space?
Mclovin_21,Packers over Colts. But honestly that's just me hoping. The pessimist in me says it'll be the Cowboys or something.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, basically."
Mclovin_21,Well the OP said players who get significant playing time.
Mclovin_21,Gotta say [Tommy B](http://blog.eastbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nfl-watch-divisional-round-tom-brady-under-armour-fierce-cleat-700x510.jpg). I've always liked the wrapped cleats.
Mclovin_21,If they are healthy. The line was garbage last year because of injuries.
Mclovin_21,"[Casey Hayward highlights!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0IBHn6asnM) Dude is a beast, if he plays outside next year at the same level as he can play the slot he'll easily become one of the next best CBs in the league."
Mclovin_21,But Marcus Marioto tho
Mclovin_21,That's debatable.
Mclovin_21,Not us. But ITTWT.
Mclovin_21,BAH GAWD OUTTA NOWHERE
Mclovin_21,Chiefs is the only recent answer. Went 2-14 in 2012 and then started out 9-0 in 2013. If they hadn't got crazy injured in the last stretch they would have probably won the West and the wildcard game.
Mclovin_21,"Brotherhood is overrated. Hatred and resentment conceiled with sportsmanship is what keeps the NFL together, and I wouldn't have it any other way!"
Mclovin_21,Shhh... AB having two top 3 years and LB having a single top 2 year makes them both the best players at their positions.
Mclovin_21,"It seems like he knows how to make a defense, and it's not as if any of the other two are any more proven. Fox is definitely the worst in our division."
Mclovin_21,"I have a great story about that play! In my fantasy football league I had a 39 point lead on one of the other teams for the last seed in the playoffs. His last player was Tom Brady, who of course decided he was gonna ball out and put on like 4 Tds and 300 yards against the Texans and score almost 40 points. It was the last drive he was gonna be in and and he threw that pass and was almost assuredly going to get a touchdown (be it on that play or on another pass afterward, Brady was on fuckin fire that night) and out of nowhere comes JJ Watt to punch it right out of Woodheads hands. Since Lloyd ""recovered"" the ball instead of it actually being a passing touchdown, Brady got no more points (ended up with 36 I think, narrowly missing my point advantage by 3), after that drive was sat and taken out of the game and I moved on to the playoffs and eventually got 2nd that year! JJ Watt saved my fantasy season."
Mclovin_21,"I knew we were gonna choke the NFCCG. I had a sickly feeling even up 16-0. I finally let myself believe for a moment we might win once Burnett picked Wilson off. That was my worst mistake, I became too emotionally invested in the SB at that moment. Quarless dropped a 3rd down pass and I knew it was over.

I was physically ill for about a week and a half after the game, still get a little sick every time I think about it for longer than a second."
Mclovin_21,The entire state of Wisconsin would have an orgasm if JJ Watt ever came to play for the Packers.
Mclovin_21,"I think Haden is a little underrated, and all three are equal imo, so completely interchangeable from 3-5."
Mclovin_21,All the time. It's kinda dumb.
Mclovin_21,"Hell, I'm jealous."
Mclovin_21,BB the coach makes up for a lot of shortcomings BB the GM has.
Mclovin_21,"They won 9 games, and LT single handedly won games ."
Mclovin_21,"Did anyone think the Chiefs weren't gonna be good? They were incredibly talented.

But anyway, the Raiders this year."
Mclovin_21,"Realistically only one, and they are coming off some serious injuries that we don't have, so I give us the edge. But I think top 2 at worst."
Mclovin_21,How dare you insult the Jimmy GOATGOATGOAT.
Mclovin_21,Sitton is 1C at worst.
Mclovin_21,"QBs can add wins, but QBs don't win the SB by themselves. None of them ever have and none of them ever will."
Mclovin_21,I mean you don't know that. She still married him. 
Mclovin_21,"The NFC is better right now, that's football."
Mclovin_21,"And a prequel called ""Hell: How the Inferno Froze Over"""
Mclovin_21,80 tho.
Mclovin_21,"Not really, I just disagree with homer goggles seahawks fans."
Mclovin_21,He was subpar because he didn't do jack shit in Seattle.
Mclovin_21,"Quinten Rollins was our best pick. Dude is gonna be beast.

Also, the WR pick was stupid no matter what anyone else tells me."
Mclovin_21,I'd take Caldwell honestly.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah Byrd is the only one I could justify taking him off for so I did, just because we haven't seen him play like he was when he was the best safety in the league in Buffalo in quite a long time."
Mclovin_21,Our Oline's weakness was the fucking dolphins. You guys like knew our cadence (I'm assuming your coach had something to do with that) and Wake exposed the fuck out of Bulaga with his speed rush.
Mclovin_21,"Definitely not the best in NFL history, but [this one](https://simmqb.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dezb-story.jpg) is probably the best from last years playoffs."
Mclovin_21,"(Hopefully) BJ Raji. Navorro Bowman for the Niners. Dude was the best LB in football before he got injured. Hope he returns to form, otherwise that's a football tragedy. He was that good."
Mclovin_21,"Jim Kelly would be 100% indisputably the GOAT. A 4peat would never be done ever again, and no one would come close to his legacy. He's already the father of the hurry up offense, and now he'd be the greatest postseason QB ever with 4 rings to back it up and amazing stats. There wouldn't be a comparison."
Mclovin_21,"Not all teams should have the same expectations. Sure it's great if the Titans make the playoffs, they have pretty low talent. It's expected for us, and it would be dumb if we didn't make a deep run."
Mclovin_21,Considering there's 35 Flairs an 7% of the people are Pats fans that's quite a bit.
Mclovin_21,It's obvious if you're someone who doesn't love Brady with the fiery passion of 1000 suns.
Mclovin_21,Literally a holdout.
Mclovin_21,"That's the worst thing I've ver heard. I can safely assume you know nothing of the Falcons, Bengals, Matt Ryan, *or* Andy Dalton. Ryan was top 5 like 2 years ago and still puts up stats of a borderline elite player with no help."
Mclovin_21,Except that one time he was exposed by Alex Smith [***mindgames***](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000266467/Smith-5-yard-TD-run).
Mclovin_21,"I mean he still threw the ints. And Teddy has a much better surround cast than Carr does, minus maybe Oline."
Mclovin_21,Honestly I don't know if it is just me but I've never particularly liked Jerry Rice. I don't dislike him but he comes off as a little... eh. The stickum just gives more fuel to the fire.
Mclovin_21,"I'm not saying it was. I think he was great. Just the last couple teams he played against sucked, that's all. He's still really good."
Mclovin_21,"1. Carr

2. Teddy

3. Winston

4. Bortles

5. Z-Mett

6. Marioto

7. Jimmy G

8. Geno Smith

9. Johnny Manziel"
Mclovin_21,"How does this keep coming up? Rodgers said he likes his on the over-inflated side of the spectrum, so before the balls were checked he had the pumped up decently. If any were too far pumped the refs would deem them unfit. The balls were all checked off and given the okay by the refs, he didn't have the balls checked and *then* uninflate them like Brady allegedly did."
Mclovin_21,"[Alex Smith fake handoff TD.](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000266467/Smith-5-yard-TD-run) Mindgames or broken play, whatever. It always makes me laugh."
Mclovin_21,"I'm kinda torn. I like him cause he seems nice and he was a Badger, but I got kinda irked by him saying them winning the NFCCG was ""God's plan all along"". Like thanks, that's a nice way to dismiss the effort of every one of your teammates and even more everyone on the Green Bay Packers. Just a big fuck you to everyone saying that God wanted them to win. Rodgers is Christian, but like he said ""God doesn't care a lot about football, only the people playing it."""
Mclovin_21,"The ""hot streak"" is kind of overblown, it really just matters how well your team is playing together overall. You obviously don't want to be losing 4 of your last 5 or 6 games, but a loss here or there doesn't really matter as long as you squeak in (Ravens in 2012, Packers in 2010, Giants in 2011)"
Mclovin_21,"They said that Vick would compete but when he got there they were like ""Nah"" and then halfway thru the season said they were disappointed that he didn't fight for it."
Mclovin_21,I mean Rodgers has only missed one game outside the collar bone incident.
Mclovin_21,We run much better under center in the I though. No point in using the shotgun toss in obvious running situations.
Mclovin_21,I refuse to believe Bakh is the best LT drafted in the past two years. He isn't that good.
Mclovin_21,Draft Jamarcus Russell and DHB
Mclovin_21,I think they'll both be around 8-8
Mclovin_21,"Eddie Lacy with 4.3 speed would be scary as shit, Aaron Rodgers would be indefensible. Bj Raji would just be funny to watch sprinting at light speed."
Mclovin_21,You get downvoted but for the most part you're right. The last several teams he played had terrible pass defenses.
Mclovin_21,"Because he played pretty good on a team full of shit for half the season, and then in his view they completely fucked him by drafting Mariota. There's really no way he can win the starting job. Even if he was better there's almost no way they don't eventually start someone they use their 2nd overall draft pick on. I don't think it's unreasonable to seek a trade if you think you can excel somewhere else."
Mclovin_21,"Eye test, he had a great TD:Int ratio. Thought he did more with less talent on his team. Played the mental side of his rookie season pretty damn well, eliminated mistakes (which is usually the No1 problem for rookie QBs) and seems to have a better overall feel for the pro game so far."
Mclovin_21,Alex Smith is like 15 attempts away from having the highest career postseason passer rating of any active QB. He just needs his team to not shit the bed and he'll be fine.
Mclovin_21,"I think Andy Dalton could take us to the playoffs, but really only Brady or Rodgers could get us to the SB."
Mclovin_21,It's so sexy.
Mclovin_21,Majik gets a mention but Dickey doesn't?
Mclovin_21,Charles Woodson
Mclovin_21,"If they play outstanding we'd pretty easily be top 5. Hayward, Shields and Burnett are all already playing at a pro-bowl level. HaHa looks to be improving to pro-bowl caliber, and if our rookies become stars there's no way we wouldn't have an elite secondary."
Mclovin_21,"It was Driver, but probably Aaron Rodgers now. The work he does for the MACC fund is awesome and he seems to really care about Green Bay despite not being from here. Unlike Favre he's not on the first plane out of here after the season ends."
Mclovin_21,"I could see over Manning, but Rodgers has been better than Brady for 5 years now. Prime Brady was 2007, but Rodgers *first* year ever as a starting QB was better than every single one of Brady's years before that."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah. Honestly he seems like too good to be true, so I'm worried that somehow he won't translate to the NFL. We have really good CB and Safety coaches though, so hopefully he can translate and learn and break out."
Mclovin_21,"Uh, he was born in Mississippi, went to Southern Miss, and wasn't even drafted by us."
Mclovin_21,"My favorite nickname is Jeff ""The GOAT"" Janis, also known as Janis the Mannis. But like a quarter of the people on our sub hate it with a passion and bitch about it non stop."
Mclovin_21,Go big or go home.
Mclovin_21,"""What if RG3 never destroys his knee?""

The Redskins beat the Seahawks in RG3s and Wilsons first ever playoff game on the back of an actually healthy RG3. The Redskins, no match for the Falcons, get completely dominated at the Georgiadome. Rolling off of a more dominant win than what actually happened against the Seahawks, they keep up the pace in the 2012 NFCCG and end up beating the 49ers. Flacco's magical ride comes to a halt as his defense meets an offense that it can't handle. The Falcons win the SB by 10ish points in the Superdome (how happy they would be) as the Ravens offense just can't keep up.

Legacy wise this changes the entire NFL. Matt Ryan is now heralded as one of the better postseason Qbs on the back of an amazing playoff run. He cements his spot as the number 5 QB in the league (as he was often thought of in 2012) and becomes elite. The Falcons end up not sucking in 2013 and winning a playoff spot as the wildcard. As a result of them being just good enough, they beat the Packers in 2013 and the Bears become NFCN champions.

Meanwhile The Seahawks don't win their very first playoff game and that sets them back several years. They lose in the NFCCG against the much more experienced Niners team who rolled through the hapless Bears, and the reigning champion Falcons get knocked out before they even face the Niners in a rematch.

The Niners go to the Superbowl, this time a year later, and face Peyton Fucking Manning, focused on destroying the team he plays, but much more calm because he doesn't have to face the Seahawks defense.

Manning ends up not being terrible in the SB and they are able to beat the Niners, mostly because of Bowman's injury. The Niners defense just can't keep up with the Broncos. Manning wins his 2nd Superbowl and becomes the indisputable GOAT. He rides off into the sunset as a 2 time SB MVP, finally outshining Eli completely.

So basically, if RG3 never tore his knee, Peyton Manning would be the GOAT QB.

This is the darkest timeline for everyone other than the Broncos and Falcons."
Mclovin_21,"A Seahawk fan once said to me when I pointed out that they've never beaten an elite QB in an away game that because they beat the Packers in the preseason, it counts as them beating Rodgers at Lambeau."
Mclovin_21,"Because Russell Wilson took a 7-9 team that allowed 15 points a game to an average of 12 wins a year. Luck took a 2-14 team that allowed 25+ points a game to 11 wins a year. That's without an even *decent* rushing game, just as shit of an Oline (actually worse because they cant run block for shit either) and obviously no defense. His 2 or 3 good receivers dont make up for that. No one does more with less than Andrew Luck."
Mclovin_21,Tony Gonzalez
Mclovin_21,"Run Blocking, especially behind Bakh. He's pretty bad at it tbh, doesn't have the size or power necessary to be a good run blocker, but even the rest of our line isn't that great at it (I guess it's mostly the tackles, you can't run up the middle forever, even if we have the best run blocking center in the league). We were like 24th in being hit behind the line of scrimmage. Lacy may be the best goal line back in the league but he gets hit behind the line half the time lol."
Mclovin_21,Honestly I'd take Tyron Smith at LT over anyone else.
Mclovin_21,"&gt;Not enough love for Seattle. Watch them get Matt Hasselbeck 2.0 and surprise everyone.

If only they knew, good call /u/xero45"
Mclovin_21,"Because our pass blocking Oline is leagues ahead of our run blocking ability, and we have Jeff ""The GOAT"" Janis and Abby to play reciever too."
Mclovin_21,"Make it actually fun. Different events all week or something like the combine. Have races, flag football with players playing different positions (omg I would pay to see BJ Raji in shotgun as the QB). After TDs the players do their best celebrations and get scored on them. Getting the ball thru the uprights on kickoff gives an extra point. "
Mclovin_21,What's Cutler's record against us again?
Mclovin_21,I would say most football players are not Dbags. Kaep is just especially immature.
Mclovin_21,[My favorite Eli picture](http://i.imgur.com/xN1CzGw.jpg). 
Mclovin_21,Yeah. That movie was just... ugh. It's more possible for Space Jam to have *actually happened* than for this to ever occur.
Mclovin_21,"Golden Tate. He's a piece of shit, dirty, and a liar. He isn't that good either. He was no one before he was forced the ball 100 times a game during the absence of CJ."
Mclovin_21,"Well played games, not defensive low scorers but definitely not shootouts. Also, December football is my favorite. Games reek of desperation and heartbreak is at it's peak in the regular season. THat's when real football starts."
Mclovin_21,Well give me your list of sadness.
Mclovin_21,"We're a little salty that after the Kaepernick hit (which btw I agree was totally inexcusable, that was dirty) every hit he makes that any other player would normally do is considered dirty. He hasn't had problems in the past, he doesn't try to injure anyone. It's unfair to put him on the same level as Suh or Raiola."
Mclovin_21,"Niners

Bears

Panthers

Redskins

Jets

Browns

Raiders

Jaguars"
Mclovin_21,"Remember when the Lions went 4-0 in the preseason and everyone thought they might actually be good, then they went 0-16? Good times."
Mclovin_21,There's a difference between greatest and best.
Mclovin_21,It's just Pats fans crying about how even though he broke the rules he doesn't deserve the punishment. Thankfully a decent amount see that he deserves a punishment.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah don't bother watching it, it's pretty painful."
Mclovin_21,"Okay, that's fair. Thanks for actually counterarguing instead of going ""hurdur no ur an idiot"". But the Tebow one couldn't have been anything more than a media move, and I still don't think Vick was given a fair chance in training camp before preseason."
Mclovin_21,"Value is different from worth, and different people can value things at different levels. And the undervalued overvalued thing is *exactly* how trade works, so I don't really know what you're talking about. Without some outside factor making someone desperate to get rid of something, no one would give something up if they thought they were receiving less than what they thought it was worth. Obviously the titans thought Mariota was worth more than what the Eagles were trying to trade for him. Since they wouldn't trade for anything less than what they valued him at, that's his actual value."
Mclovin_21,If Lane didn't go out with that injury I doubt the Pats win.
Mclovin_21,Melvin Gordon. I said it before he was drafted and I'll stick with my pick!
Mclovin_21,Chiefs or Raiders. The other thread was probably about the NFC because its hard as shit to get into the wildcard compared to the AFC so it's a little more difficult for bad teams to step up. Though the south is weaker.
Mclovin_21,"No, but saying that he got the completion record doesn't prove he's good or something. THe other statsare better examples."
Mclovin_21,"Anyone who says that football is terrible, has no action, shouldn't be called football, players are pussies because of pads, etc. It's so annoying.

Oh, and the worst: ""It's just a game"". Fuck you in particular. The worst thing someone could say, especially after the NFCCG."
Mclovin_21,"It's not how much he deflated it, it's that he illegally did it after the refs had checked it. Even if the refs deflated it too much and then he re inflated them to proper levels, that would still be cheating."
Mclovin_21,Going by what we were by the playoffs? Then 2010. It was basically the 2nd ranked defense with the offense from 2011. That team was legit.
Mclovin_21,"Uh, no. He had the same 40 time as Cam Newton. He's just as mobile, he just doesn't do it as often."
Mclovin_21,"Running QBs

Game Managers

Technicians

Journemyan

God(ger)s"
Mclovin_21,You get downvoted but I agree. If Luck had any semblance of help on his team he'd be a top 5 QB easy and would more likely than not already have a SB win.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, it's a double whammy. At least we pretty much dominated him both times he played us."
Mclovin_21,"His career percentage is what I'm talking about. One year slightly better than Rodgers is an outlier, unlike what Rodgers consistently does every year. Brady's *best* years are average to Rodgers. Obviously that doesn't tell the whole story, but he's still leagues ahead of anyone else over the course of his career, just like in TD:int ratio, too."
Mclovin_21,"I think Sherman is a pretty good sportsman. Talk shit, but he backs it up, gives props when he gets burned."
Mclovin_21,"Lol, he robbed that from better competition."
Mclovin_21,It's basically the same thing. Usually wing T has one receiver outside and another HB or TE lined up to either side
Mclovin_21,"[Figure this one out, coach!](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/smoking-aaron-rodgers-in-tribute-of-jay-cutler.gif?w=1000)

No but seriously I wonder what that one means."
Mclovin_21,Slightly worse than Rodgers? We can barely win playoff games *with* the best QB in the league. 9-7ish is what I'd think.
Mclovin_21,"Well I said ""Raiders"", not ""Raiders fans""."
Mclovin_21,Fair enough.
Mclovin_21,"We were 13-3 in 2007. And the reason we lost that game is because Favre threw a game losing pick. Nothing Eli did was that special. In 2011 we went 15-1 and then all our receivers dropped every ball, Aaron Rodgers was our leading rudher, and our Oline shit the bed. Eli had a good game, but seriously we were the 32nd ranked defense and his defense had more to do with the win than he did. Twice is not many times."
Mclovin_21,[This play](http://gfycat.com/WastefulGeneralCrossbill#) is just like some Madden bullshit. Such a ridiculous play. Too bad it was called back.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah but the difference is that they usually get criticized, and are nowhere near as bad as Brady."
Mclovin_21,"Just because you're great outside or great inside doesn't mean you can switch easily. Hayward didn't get targeted that often, and had comparable stats per target to every other elite CB.

There's a reason he got 6 votes being a ""backup slot corner"" on a small market team, because those 6 people actually knew what they were talking about and he was amazing."
Mclovin_21,"I guess the Eagles. Greenbros, miracle in the new meadowlands, wrecking the bears in 2013 so we could still win the division.

Aside from a certain 4th down I don't like to talk about..."
Mclovin_21,['85 Bears' Wilber Marshall destroying Joe Ferguson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuj_NF7gteQ#t=72). That's a nasty hit. Ditka thought he killed him!
Mclovin_21,"Sam Shields pretty easily, like you said. Dude is a beast. I'm honestly not sure how he didn't get drafted just based on his speed."
Mclovin_21,Either Rodgers or Luck. I'd say it's Luck's to lose because he has an easy ass schedule compared to Rodgers.
Mclovin_21,I didn't realize we were on /r/Seahawks
Mclovin_21,Josh Gordon and it's not even close. 
Mclovin_21,"He was top 5 two years ago, still puts up top 10 numbers. Hes way underrated."
Mclovin_21,"2/3 Times, meh. The Saints raped us, I don't hate Mark Ingram or Drew Brees. The Seahawks beat us, I don't hate Sherman or Lynch. Kaep is just a douche though. This tweet is pretty good evidence of that."
Mclovin_21,"Honestly I kinda hope Bell does. I like the guy, and I would have loved him or Lacy out of college (so basically I got the dream) but I'm pretty tired of hearing Steelers' fans say ""We have a top 5 QB, the best WR and the best RB in the game"". Also seriously one good year (albeit it a phenomenal season) and suddenly he's light years ahead of Lacy, who had a much better rookie year and is almost as good imo. People ignore the fact that he had a worse rookie year than Trent Richardson and has off the field issues, and that kinda irks me. I do like him though, so I'm kinda conflicted."
Mclovin_21,Seriously the worst jersey you could ever buy. No one over 5 should own one.
Mclovin_21,Because Rodgers is the career postseason passer rating leader of all active QBs and his defense hasn only allowed less than 23 points like twice since 2010 (which is fucking awful).
Mclovin_21,"I honestly forgot about him, but Cromartie did have a pretty killer year. He also shows up for the playoffs every time."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah this thread is seriously awful. Especially when they compare him with other QBs who have great defenses, Olines, run games and receivers (which Luck hasn't really had until recently) and then say he's shit because they look at his stats after he carried the team by himself."
Mclovin_21,OBJ better than Nelson? You crazy.
Mclovin_21,"Maybe, but the difference between their skills is much bigger imo. Graham can't block for shit, he disappears against good coverage and he doesn't fight the same way Gronk does. It's Gronk's fiesta and we're all just living in it."
Mclovin_21,"I hate when people are like ""you can't have an opinion on a draft till three years later"". That's a dumb mentality, it's interesting and insightful to try to rate drafts before, during, and after their first year of playing."
Mclovin_21,"I'm sure I got my fair share of downvotes for it, but it's ridiculous that people have him in their top 10 and in some cases in their top 5. He's just not there. Talk about sensationalism."
Mclovin_21,"I used to like Russell Wilson but I can't stand his fake ass shit, blaming their wins solely on God, broke (tied?) the rookie TD record on the fail mary. His robot smugness irks me. "
Mclovin_21,"I'm not salty at all. (Okay maybe a little about the onside kick) But I didn't mean for it to seem mad. Just calling it how I see it (and how it actually went).

If all of the LoB come back to full potential and another one of their corners steps up they'll be favorites to win. But even with that sometimes it's better to be lucky than to be good, and I think they showed that last year (though they were both)."
Mclovin_21,Rodgers blowing the statistical average out of the water for division games.
Mclovin_21,I'm positive that Rivers could have just as well won the SB in NY.
Mclovin_21,Crazy that that shit happens when 3 of their 4 best players get injured in the game.
Mclovin_21,"I'm confused, they did have the 7th overall pick. Didn't they?"
Mclovin_21,"I've never seen anyone call Rodgers the GOAT. It just doesn't happen. People do, however, sometimes say that he may be the *best* to ever play. There's a difference between best and greatest."
Mclovin_21,How is it against the rules to check the PSI?
Mclovin_21,"No, it isn't. It's ""Top 100 Players of *2015*"". It's for the upcoming season, that's what they tell the players."
Mclovin_21,"Fantastic. Still was a rookie though. His 2 ints in the NFCCG followed by blowing the 2 pt conversion was a pretty accurate summation of his season. Always in the right place, has potential to make spectacular plays but still needs to learn and be consistent. Shields and Burnett were just always there and always doing their job. Ha Ha and Casey Hayward will probably be the future but until they establish themselves compltely"
Mclovin_21,"Assuming he plays for a decently long career then yes, absolutely. There's a reason he has the highest YPC in NFL history, he's fucking beast. *And* that's after he tore his ACL."
Mclovin_21,"He's a good GM, but he's a way better coach. Gronk, McCourty and Brady are really the only players you could call ""superstars"" on the team, because just like any other GM he has misses and hits. His team isn't the most talented in the league, but he consistently makes the playoffs because he's a much better coach."
Mclovin_21,The same guy told me Aaron Rodgers basically only made easy throws and Brett Favre *routinely* made throws Aaron Rodgers could never do.
Mclovin_21,"3-2, literally tarnished."
Mclovin_21,Kurt Warner.
Mclovin_21,A-rod is easier to type and faster to say. But his real nickname is A-a-rod.
Mclovin_21,Mighty Ducks: The Story of Chip Kelly's Philadelphia Eagles
Mclovin_21,I don't actually really like college ball so no. I just think Melvin Gordon is gonna be a stud.
Mclovin_21,"Completion percentage doesn't make the QB. And he threw more yards because he threw more times. Rodger has a higher ypa, which is what really matters."
Mclovin_21,Far and away Brad Jones. It's not even close. No one has ever been on his level of garbage.
Mclovin_21,"&gt;I'll take ""meaningless stats"" for 800, Alex.
 
&gt;The only Super Bowl MVP winning Quarterback to also win Jeopardy

&gt;Who is Aaron Rodgers?

&gt;Correct!"
Mclovin_21,Too bad I'm a broke college student or I might.
Mclovin_21,I love you anyway for at least thinking of them.
Mclovin_21,"LG: Josh Sitton

RG: Marshal Yanda"
Mclovin_21,"I wouldn't say Rodgers was a ""project"" in what we would label them now.

But other than that, Jeff Janis was a project WR who was really raw but had all the tangibles. Ended up becoming the GOAT, so that's pretty cool."
Mclovin_21,"Plenty of other recent teams have allowed less PPG and less YPG, so not really."
Mclovin_21,Uh yeah he was. He 1v11d us in the final 3 Seattle drives.
Mclovin_21,"I'm gonna say you don't know anything about playing Cb if you think it's easier than playing outside. CBs say *all the time* that its harder to play inside than outside. He played 1/3 of the snaps yet still had 6 ints? He had comparable stats to the best players in the league with less attempts. I'm not sure his exact snap count (its definitely more than 1/3) but he still had the same amount of tackles as PP, Joe Haden, and Sherman, with 2 less ints than sherman, 1 less than PP, and 3 more than Haden. That's impressive for a ""backup"" as you put it."
Mclovin_21,Seahawks would have won both SBs. RG3 would be really good because his coach isn't a dumbfuck. Tannehill would be awful. Colts would be struggling at 8-8 every year.
Mclovin_21,"I don't think one player gets discriminated against a ton, but I'm saying that each grader has their own prejudices and likes. Certain players do get sensationalized no matter what though. JJ Watt is amazing, I'm probably one of his biggest supporters, but I mean really? He was 70 points ahead of the next closest DE. That's insane, and most likely just arbitrary."
Mclovin_21,My point is that Moss was better with worse talent around him.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah pretty crazy debut. Caught his first pass for a TD (on a wrong route, I might add) and then later received a kickoff and tied the kickoff return record."
Mclovin_21,Stop reading my mind.
Mclovin_21,"Oh, yeah I know. I just meant how do they say he lacks height when Bridgewater is the same size."
Mclovin_21,"Why shouldn't he be? He may not be better than a lot of the FS, but he easily just came off a top 5 SS year, maybe even top 3. "
Mclovin_21,"Call it recency bias but I think Deion was the best corner of all time. Dude was the *original* shut down corner. He talked trashed, played and partied larger than life, and backed it up with superb play. If I was gonna choose one corner to cover the GOAT WR on one play/game I'd choose Deion 100/100 times."
Mclovin_21,Fuck that guy. Never correct yourself. Apply for a position in title only and establish your dominance.
Mclovin_21,"It sounds good, but don't You'll fall asleep in the first 15 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. I *love* all football movies. Haven't seen one I didn't like. But this one is truly the most boring one I've ever seen."
Mclovin_21,As per the rules it wasn't though. He was just being a good sport.
Mclovin_21,I mean it's a program on NFL network every Wed.
Mclovin_21,"Oh shit, you're right!"
Mclovin_21,That was hilarious
Mclovin_21,"It was Flynnsanity! Just Flynn, baby!"
Mclovin_21,I love Smith but you can't put him in over Ryan
Mclovin_21,"I'd probably go to the Seahawks after no one came to my birthday party and the Browns traded up for and passed on me, causing me to slide in the draft until they traded back into the first, 1 spot ahead of the Hawks and traded for all their first round picks they gave for me in the first place."
Mclovin_21,"It's not more valuable than the 1st overall pick, though."
Mclovin_21,"That's probably super unpopular. Adams is a stud. He moved up the depth chart pretty easily, and I'm pretty sure he'll eventually be a probowler like Nelson ended up being. I'd be astounded if he got beat, especially by Montgomery (who has the dropsies and honestly isn't that polished of a receiver) but who knows, stranger things have happened."
Mclovin_21,"""Sam Shields is awful, Clay Matthews can be the best ILB in the league, we need to replace Burnett!"""
Mclovin_21,That's just ridiculous. Some eyeshield 21 shit right there. Looks like what I would imagine how an NFL player would do against an average high school football team.
Mclovin_21,Well he's popular right now so there's always two. The Watt circlejerk and the anti-Watt circlejerk.
Mclovin_21,I'm actually really surprised this is actually a thing. I thought it would just be a third party but this is pretty damning for Brady.
Mclovin_21,"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."
Mclovin_21,"The Packers would have been the first team in NFL history to start 2 HoF players at QB durign all 16 games. Is the ball going to Aaron Rodgers, or Peyton Manning? Who knows? You can't cover both of their pinpoint accuracy throws at the same time. I call it, the backwards inverted wishbone offense."
Mclovin_21,"It did stop him, however, from winning anything meaningful. He's only won a SB with a superb defense behind him."
Mclovin_21,It doesn't matter if he wanted them lower than 12.5 or not. Deflating the balls after they've been checked it cheating. 
Mclovin_21,He is tho.
Mclovin_21,"More read option (not that much but more than 1 play per year), less Clay Matthews at ILB, shift more towards a base cover 3 (which I'm like 90% sure is what they have in mind and are going to do).

And finally, *waaaaaay* fewer toss plays."
Mclovin_21,"Datone Jones is due for a breakout year. He's show flashes of some really great play. If he can be consistent and step it up he can definitely be a very good DE.

And the obvious one in HHCD. Hopefully he steps up to pro-bowl level this year, he showed enough potential to eventually be an all-pro, but until then I hope he just keeps progressing like he did throughout the season. He should be a stud."
Mclovin_21,If only Marlon McCree wasn't a dumbass.
Mclovin_21,"Aside from the tangibles like accuracy, IQ, etc, he's gotta have *it*. Some have it more than other, it can't be learned. It doesn't necessarily mean he's already elite, but it makes you be able to just *see* that the guy is gonna be special. A great example is Luck. He may not be elite now but you can just tell that you're watching someone who is gonna be great. He has the *it* factor that wins games and makes people gravitate towards him."
Mclovin_21,Not that it's gotten any better with the Pats fans. Just after losing the troll Seahawks fans are more quiet. But when one door closes another one opens.
Mclovin_21,"We'd get our total to 14 championships, that'd be okay with me."
Mclovin_21,"""Cobb is in the backfield! I wonder what's gonna happen?"""
Mclovin_21,And you don't think a bunch of Carr's came from his god awful receivers and runningbacks?
Mclovin_21,"Reduces the relevance of a TD, almost makes defense now a tad more important just because of the rule."
Mclovin_21,"JJ Watt. He's ridiculous. I mean people like Randy Moss and Dan Marino changed the game, but Watt (and I know this is still premature) is just so far ahead of everyone else that there's no competition. There's *nothing* like him. There's no way for the game to adjust to such a talent. You can't just start putting 2 safeties deep, you can't queue in on the passing game. The only thing that beats Watt is more guys. He's truly too unique to change how the game is played because there's only one of him and there will probably never be another one like him. It's a pleasure to watch that guy play at his peak just a year at a time, a lifetime of it would be insane."
Mclovin_21,"We don't really know. He never learned the offense while he was starting (he was literally on the practice squad a week before becoming our starting QB in 2013) and after that he didn't impress. People on our sub seem to think he is or is going to be better than Flynn but I don't see it. At least he has a [sick juke](http://dailysnark.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/scotttolzien-spin-move.gif), though."
Mclovin_21,100% Brad Jones.
Mclovin_21,"Assuming that rule changes/athleticism/etc is the same I think no one would be able to beat the 72 Dolphins. Super underrated team imo. It should go without saying they are one of the best if not the best team in NFL history but they still don't get very much respect.

If teams literally went back in time and played them then they'd probably get crushed by a good amount of teams because of athleticism, but I'm not sure every single team could beat them."
Mclovin_21,"Because it's against the rules. Who gives a shit if it's a stupid rule, it's still a rule. Just like the catch rule. It might be annoying or not fun, but it's still the rule, and by the rule it wasn't a catch (and Brady cheated)."
Mclovin_21,He's saying that like 10:1 is bad.
Mclovin_21,Not really.
Mclovin_21,"On the fast track though? That's ridiculous. And he did not have the best rookie season ever. He didn't even have a chance to play more than 12 games so he never hit the rookie wall. And yeah Kam is a good example. Everyone knows him he's part of the LoB, but he's not the best SS in the league, he's not a top 5 Safety at all, but people assume he is because they know him and the LoB."
Mclovin_21,"How does what they've done in a three year span have to do with what they did in 2013. The 2006 Bears and Ravens, 2002 Buccs, 2000 Titans, are all easily better than them. And a few other recent ones are close.

So much recency bias. The 2013 Seahawks are not the 6th best defense in NFL history."
Mclovin_21,Peyton Manning. He's the better QB. Regular season vs postseason play is overrated.
Mclovin_21,"The ultimate team sport. It's a chess match that pushes the best athletes in the world to their absolute limit every play. Most other sports are more about stamina which is nice and all but it's not really the same. I like soccer but a choice between people jogging around all game and super athletes going all out (not to say that other sports aren't amazing athletes, they obviously are) I take football every time. I also like the position differentiation, it makes it more interesting to me."
Mclovin_21,"I didn't say that. I just don't see how anyone could possibly think they've improved. My personal prediction was 11 games but that's just me. I said nothing of the sort like ""they shouldn't try"" or ""they can't win the SB""."
Mclovin_21,"Who are you gonna replace him with? You have one of the 4 elite QBs right now, a HoFer, and you're complaining?"
Mclovin_21,"You have to give the referees the balls before the game for them to inspect. They can be within a 2.5 (I think) PSI range. You inflate them to what you want but then the refs have to check to make sure they are legal. It's okay to make it your preference as long as the refs check off on it, it's illegal to let them check it and *then* deflate or inflate the balls, which is what happened here from my understanding."
Mclovin_21,I can tell this isn't gonna be the thread for me...
Mclovin_21,"Oh boy, lol. You're in for some fun."
Mclovin_21,Who is doom?
Mclovin_21,Nah. Just usual seahawks crying because I don't consider them the GOAT defense with an elite QB.
Mclovin_21,PFF isn't law.
Mclovin_21,"It's way overblown. He maybe would take 4 or so extra sacks over a season that another player might not. Maybe in 2009 and 2010 he did it a tad, but even then it was still way overblown. His line has been a steaming pile of horse shit for every year he's played except for this past year, and even then (though we have a ridiculously good pass blocking Oline) his LT is pretty mediocre, which is probably the most important position in terms of pass blocking."
Mclovin_21,Also we are probably like the most injured team to ever make the playoffs.
Mclovin_21,"Morgan Burnett. He's one of the best run stopping safeties in the league, and if we didn't have him our defense would be swiss cheese. A lot of people criticize him after he fell off a cliff in 2013 but he backed it up with a top 5 SS year after he finally got some help at FS next to him. I think even our fans take him for granted because without him we'd get torched every game. He's the leader of our defense, and sets a physical presence where not many other on our defense can. He also has far and away the most tackles of any safety in the league, and we depend on him to make the plays when we need it the most."
Mclovin_21,"I don't care if he's a top 10 receiver, we don't need a WR so it makes no sense. Shit like this is why we exit the playoffs early every year."
Mclovin_21,Kinda funny how Smith's doing better than Kaep right now though.
Mclovin_21,Bradshaw didn't have an asterisk unlike Brady*. /s
Mclovin_21,Falcons legend Brent Farve.
Mclovin_21,"&gt; which I know he's not

Oh man, so much homerism. He hasn't even played a full season, you don't know jack shit about what he's gonna do. He's a good receiver, just not top 10 yet."
Mclovin_21,"Jesus, such a moronic thing to say. I wanna tag that comment of his and in 10 years when Rodgers retires as one of the best, if not the best to ever play make fun of him for saying that."
Mclovin_21,"There's a few Lombardi Packers that were amazing but might not ever get in. There's a real bias these days against the Lombardi Packers because they always get dismissed as ""having a great team"" or there already being too many so a bunch of them got snubbed D:"
Mclovin_21,It was *probably* at **least** generally aware of the deflating.
Mclovin_21,"While Rodgers may be the best QB to ever play, he's not the greatest. There's a difference He doesn't have the rings, so while he could be the best talent to ever touch the field he's not gonna be that high in the GOAT discussion till his career is over and he has records/MVPs/more rings."
Mclovin_21,"If he just has a down year, meh. If he does absolutely *terribly* like you said then he'd be out of GOAT contention for me personally. It'd be Montana 100%."
Mclovin_21,Mike Wallace.
Mclovin_21,Yeah. I assumed it meant active players.
Mclovin_21,"Doesn't make me any less wrong though, which he is completely. And I don't expect to get anywhere in the Pats/Seahawks circlejerk that is /r/nfl anyway."
Mclovin_21,"I feel like you just wanted to start a shitstorm but it's Luck by a pretty wide margin. Not that Wilson isn't great, but Luck has the most potential in the league right now, and he can carry the team by himself, make all the throws, *and* run like nobodies business."
Mclovin_21,A top 5 QB? No.
Mclovin_21,"Hayward got snubbed a couple years ago, hopefully Rollins plays similarly and actually gets it."
Mclovin_21,Cris Carter talked a ton of shit. Not sure how good he was at it but he did it a lot.
Mclovin_21,"I disagree. Not sure why everyone is so up on Davis and down on Haden, but all three are a step below Sherman and Revis and a step above everyone else."
Mclovin_21,"Offense vs Defense? I mean we were 2nd in the NFL in points allowed, only behind PIT. Both defenses allowed similar PPG to the 2013 Seahawks but we both ended up scoring almost double what we allowed on average."
Mclovin_21,I'd put money that the next three QB MVPs will go to Luck and/or Rodgers
Mclovin_21,"Yeah he does, still isn't a dedicated strong safety though."
Mclovin_21,"20 years is different from 50 years, including 20 of horrible suckitude."
Mclovin_21,"Not sure if it counts cause he had a pretty decent year, but it seems like Hopkins is due for a monster year this year. Kid is special."
Mclovin_21,"1. Bucs - Aaron Rodgers (I know they just picked Winston but I doubt anyone would pass up the opportunity)

2. Titans - Josh Sitton? (I don't know how their guard situation is, but he's the 2nd best player on the team)

3. Jaguars - Clay Matthews

4. Raiders - Randall Cobb (younger, can play the slot better)

5. Redskins - Morgan Burnett (again, not exactly sure about their strong safety depth, but they have no need for WRs or RBs, which are our next best players)

6. Jets - Eddie Lacy

7. Bears - HHCD

8. Falcons - Mike Daniels

9. Giants - Jordy Nelson

10. Rams - Sam Shields

11. Vikings - Casey Hayward (Waynes is still unproven, worst case scenario he's one of if not the best slot corner in the league, best case he's a stud outside CB for them)

I don't know nearly enough about the team needs to do something accurately, but this takes into account who our best players are and what I assume is needed by each team."
Mclovin_21,I mean he's 6'4 and not particularly athletic. He's not a good red zone target.
Mclovin_21,"Shields and Burnett are currently the best players on our defense (excluding Matthews). I'm flabbergasted at how many times people think we're replacing Burnett or something when the dude is coming off a top 5 SS year. Shields shut down some of the best receivers in the league *regularly*. He got beat horribly by Julio that one game but he was concussed and, even so, that was *one* game of the season.

Matthews is a good ILB but he's really not *that* great, he's succeeded based on raw football talent, not because he's suited to the position. Thriving just because he's a good football player isn't worth him moving out of the OLB position, where he's really the best he can be."
Mclovin_21,"Quite possibly the least likely team to be involved in tampergate! We only sign people who are cut, not URFA, so I don't know how we could be tampering."
Mclovin_21,"Mett had like zero help, he played decent for how little he had."
Mclovin_21,"Since he became a starter, absolutely. "
Mclovin_21,1 SB win in your entire teams history doesn't sound like good shape to me.
Mclovin_21,Except Bridgewater threw the same amount of ints and less TDs on a team that's way more talented than the Raiders
Mclovin_21,"That doesn't mean he's a better passer. Passer rating, like I said, only takes into account stats and not the context. Wilson isn't better than Andrew Luck. Wilson just had a down year. He might not even be better than Ryan Tannehill."
Mclovin_21,If he's so great why did he do so poorly after Johnson got healthy? DT was there the entire year and Sanders still got yards and TDs. I recognize that obviously Manning is better but he wasn't very good the last half of the season. His targets went down after he became not the only option and his stats got worse. Are you gonna suggest that Tate all of a sudden got worse and couldn't get open as much?
Mclovin_21,"I think it's time for him to make the leap from ""Elite Dragon"" to ""Elite Mega Dragon 2000"""
Mclovin_21,"The 6 votes part is more of a reference to him saying that a ""backup"" shouldn't have won urn if that was true he'd have gotten no votes. Kuechly plays ones of the most spectacular positions in the game and had a ton of tackles. The players on the Packers other than Rodgers get little to no recognition, especially on this defense because we're not known for having a good one. Josh Sutton has been one of the best LG in the league for a few years but is just now getting recognition. This past year was jordy nelsons first ever pro bowl. Like it or not the players don't get nearly as much coverage as players in New York or Dallas or something do. The effe t is eoomhasized by the fact that he played slot corner rather than a more notable position."
Mclovin_21,Neither of them are top 10 imo. They are pretty close to the same level.
Mclovin_21,"The NFL doesn't particularly care about the fans. They never contradict officials, only crack down hard on drug use and minor protocol errors. Anything that could lead back to fault of the NFL is completely ignored. It is kinda sad."
Mclovin_21,These are terrible predictions. The ones you did last year weren't even close either.
Mclovin_21,"From any team? 1 Patrick Willis, please. Easy SB.

My team? Nick Collins, even though we have a ton of safety depth. He was on a borderline HoF pace. We'd have the best secondary in the league."
Mclovin_21,"That's because you have no clue what his assignment was. Much of the time it was his responsibility to be reading whether it's a run or pass, he's not just rushing as soon as he can."
Mclovin_21,"I think if Lane didn't go out then you guys would have won. Now we have to hear ""Tom Brady shredded the LoB"" all offseason when he didn't even score a point until Lane went out with his broken arm."
Mclovin_21,In 2014. Ended in heartbreak city 5 minutes before we got there.
Mclovin_21,"Rollins was a great pick, the other two not so much."
Mclovin_21,On the other hand instead of playing the three top defenses in the NFL and three of the best home field advantages in the NFL our away games are slightly easier.
Mclovin_21,Byron Jones and BJ Raji. Can you imagine a 350 pound man leaping 12 feet across the air after you?
Mclovin_21,They don't understand. And such dicks about it. The NFCCG was like having a close friend dying.
Mclovin_21,"Uh, the report said specifically the organization was at no fault."
Mclovin_21,"It doesn't take into account Oline, rushing game, receivers, talent, defense. Wilson isn't a better passer than Andrew Luck, and pretty much no one other than Seahawks fans would agree with that."
Mclovin_21,Whata dick.
Mclovin_21,I think they're trying to avoid tarnishing Ray Lewis' reputation as the GOAT linebacker. If we let him play then he'd be the undisputed best LB of all time! There are quite a bit more GOAT receivers so it's okay for him to play there.
Mclovin_21,LOOOL. I would never watch football again.
Mclovin_21,Fuckin rekt.
Mclovin_21,"For the entire run he basically didn't do much, and let's not get ahead of ourselves, he led them down the field for a field goal with no pressure. Still great, but by no means amazing. He was carried on the back of his run game and D, which is fine, but it's not as if he carried his team at all."
Mclovin_21,He needs some fashion tips though ooh boy.
Mclovin_21,"Sherman aint too good at covering the smaller receivers. Got burned bad by TY in 2013, too."
Mclovin_21,Their defense wasn't as good when they went 7-9 so its different. Russell Wilson is good but he's not even close to being the reason why they won the SB.
Mclovin_21,"Packers and Colts.

The pessimist in me says the Cowboys or something though."
Mclovin_21,Well you know what I mean. He's only been a star for 2 years.
Mclovin_21,People question Rice now all the time. Randy Moss has a really strong case for GOAT. Just because Rice played for a million years doesn't mean he was better than Moss. Especially with stickem.
Mclovin_21,"I'm of the opinion that Mariota is gonna bust real hard on the Titans. I could see them winning 5 or 6 games with Metty but not anymore if Mariota is already the ""day 1 starter"""
Mclovin_21,Nah. Moss is 2nd at worst in the discussion for GOAT. Peterson is good but he's not greater than moss.
Mclovin_21,"With Marrone I'd have thought they had a chance to be good. I personally think Rex Ryan is a garbage coach, so I doubt they do anything notable with him."
Mclovin_21,Honestly if you're at a shit football high school like I was the coaches will place you wherever the hell they want.
Mclovin_21,It's just Brady. The Patriots are at no fault here.
Mclovin_21,"I didn't say they won't be good, just that they won't make it past the divisional round. And it's an unpopular opinion for a reason, not sure what me being a Packer fan has to do with it."
Mclovin_21,No he moved inside his last year. He can play every position.
Mclovin_21,"Blaine ""I'm gonna beat you for the next 15 years"" Gabbert"
Mclovin_21,Except rookies almost *always* fall off in the last 4 games because of the rookie wall. THey aren't used to playing 16+ games a year.
Mclovin_21,I guess it just depends how many other receivers are on the list.
Mclovin_21,It really doesn't I've seen/read both but the anime is kinda drawn out for no reason during certain parts.
Mclovin_21,"Nah he was actually ~~all-american~~ honorable mention for all-american during his freshman season. He just converted to CB in college and then got arrested for marijuana possession so instead of bieng a 7th rounder he went undrafted. Dude worked like an animal and got a big payday so I'm really proud of him! He turned his life around, and now could potentially be a top 10 CB"
Mclovin_21,What about Warner or Dickerson? I think of them before Faulk when I hear Rams tbh.
Mclovin_21,Height is a pretty big dealbreaker.
Mclovin_21,"I think you might have had too much of the Ted koolaid. Not evryonr is untouchable, this is the NFL. The difference in 2011 was that webjusy came off a SB win, had just had the #2 defense, and hadn't exitted the playoffs early for 3 of the past 4 years."
Mclovin_21,"I forget which exact season but it came down to points scored between the Packers and Panthers once, and they were both playing at the same time. So not only did both have to win but they both had to blow the other team out as much as they could. But that was only if the Cowboys lost IIRC and they ended up winning so it was moot.

Fucking Cowboys."
Mclovin_21,"Maybe not, but I think most people would."
Mclovin_21,"Brady hasn't won an MVP in 5 years, and Peyton just had the most stacked offense of all time to get his, *and* Rodgers was out half the season. I don't think he'd have won it anyway, but it's really not a knock on Rodgers."
Mclovin_21,2004 and 2007 seem like entirely different eras.
Mclovin_21,I'd honestly say LT or Sanders but I'm not sure if that's just the recency bias talking.
Mclovin_21,Well he didn't have Moss for that long but yeah.
Mclovin_21,"I think Randy Moss is the best receiver to ever play. Jerry Rice is the Greatest, but that's different."
Mclovin_21,Still not really. 
Mclovin_21,"At least you have one of the GOATs, that's better than the Cardinals or something."
Mclovin_21,That's why I'm asking.
Mclovin_21,"FUCK LB, WE PLAY DOLLAR COIN DEFENSE"
Mclovin_21,Your username is my favorite out of all the people on reddit.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah anyone else that's ""you gotta watch your body language on the sideline"" or ""be more mature than that"". With Brady it's just ""he's such a fierce competitor!"""
Mclovin_21,"No. It was not a play he should've made. His job was to **block** and let Jordy Nelson catch the ball. But he decided to be a star and go for the catch, and cost us the game because of it."
Mclovin_21,"Unitas, Dan Marino, Don Hutson, maybe Joe Namath, Ray Lewis."
Mclovin_21,"Except the fact that they received valuable signed merchandise, and Tom Brady denied even knowing McNally even though he really did. He also wouldn't release any of his text messages or emails, and even when given the opportunity to *choose* which ones to give still declined."
Mclovin_21,"[This comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1tvqdg/with_the_end_of_the_regular_season_tomorrow_what/cebxiq8) It *never* fails to make me laugh, especially the fact that he predicted the Rodgers to Cobb game winner (It was the day before Week 17 vs Chicago). /u/xerillum will always be a legend to me."
Mclovin_21,"Nothing, except maybe actually accept the Nike designs they declined a couple years ago."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah. You also can't forget that Wilson has a shit Oline and receivers when we are talking about his stats, but they are underrated and still really good when we talk about the Seahawks. Those are the two big ones."
Mclovin_21,Why?
Mclovin_21,Everyone besides like two people in the 2013 and 2014 draft classes.
Mclovin_21,Fuck that game. It was like Aaron Rodgers was playing 1 on 11. 
Mclovin_21,"Who was the guy that was going up against Megatron and was like ""Ima be called Optimus Prime""?"
Mclovin_21,"How do you know? He might not have gotten injured, and I'd rather let then the bennet than a once in a generational physical talent."
Mclovin_21,"Alex Smith is too low. He has that Ryan Gosling thing going on.  Also a little biased (okay a lot) but Rodgers is pretty sexy. I think he's better looking than Brees.

Also Cam and Mariota too high."
Mclovin_21,"I'd like to see JJ Watt in #12, so he can play QB too and carry the Texans to the playoffs."
Mclovin_21,Why do so many of our defensive players have a slump? Can't we just draft someone that's a superstar thru and thru? Hopefully HaHa is.
Mclovin_21,Tittle?
Mclovin_21,He is but Sherman is fucking 98 and Rodgers was on the run and it was like a perfect 40 yards in the air pass and Sherman didn't even go for the ball. **What more do I have to do?** I'm so bad at Madden...
Mclovin_21,I'm still mad. This kid better be special!
Mclovin_21,"Not sure if you're referring to me, but I didn't downvote shit.

And really, #lolbrowns from a Jets fan?"
Mclovin_21,"Really? How could someone hate Burnett? The dude is the most consistent guy on our defense and is now unquestionably the leader. He played like he was on fire last season, too. If he keeps that up he'll definitely be an elite SS."
Mclovin_21,Partly I think Shields just played really well in our game.
Mclovin_21,Meh it's mostly that he's just a Dbag. I don't hate other people who beat us.
Mclovin_21,"Honestly if the players have shown one thing from the top 100 list it's that they don't know jack shit, and it's just as bad as the pro-bowl."
Mclovin_21,"Go big or go home, right?"
Mclovin_21,"QB: Joe Montana

RB: Jim Brown

WR: Rice

TE: Gonzalez

LB: LT

DL: Reggie White

CB: Deion Sanders

S: Ronnie Lott

Too lazy to do Oline."
Mclovin_21,I like the Byrd pick. Certainly a bold one.
Mclovin_21,I was hoping that would make me like him more but that was seriously a bad commercial haha.
Mclovin_21,"Nah, just maybe articles from a website called ""www.Xplayersname.com"""
Mclovin_21,Yeah It's kinda awful.
Mclovin_21,"I honestly don't understand that. Sure when he was the No1 target he played great, as soon as CJ came back and was healthy he didn't do jack shit all year. Not a single game over 100 yards, only 1 TD the entire rest of the year."
Mclovin_21,"Honestly this would taint his legacy. Not by *that* much, but still he would have won his last SB partially by cheating. That's a big deal."
Mclovin_21,I seriously doubt Kuechly wins it in 2013. I don't think he even should have won DPOTY. There were several players with better years.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah but the saints play at least 8 games in doors, whereas the Packers play at least 8 outdoor, 4 of which in coldish weather."
Mclovin_21,"Well no shit a turnover would be bad, but he doesn't even have to throw it. It was tied, they could have just run the clock out and went into OT."
Mclovin_21,"Sanchez, Tebow, Vick, now Fitzie, all got screwed by the mishandling of the Jets."
Mclovin_21,That doesn't contradict anything I said.
Mclovin_21,I'd say he's better than Mathis.
Mclovin_21,"Bears Packers, Cowboys Eagles, Chiefs Raiders

That said, I don't think that *right now* any other divisions have the same amount of hate that the NFCN and NFCE have. They just aren't on the same level."
Mclovin_21,He sucked on the Buccs.
Mclovin_21,"Well if you look at it another way (not necessarily better or worse) he got more chances than Cobb did per game. It's not Cobb's fault he didn't get forced the ball a ton of times. The reason you can't say tha about a rookie, especially one who didn't even play 16 games is that he never had a chance to hit the rookie wall, and most of his stuff came against horrible defenses. It's hard to tell how good he is when you dont have a big sample size."
Mclovin_21,"The 1958 NFL Championship, Colts vs Giants, ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"""
Mclovin_21,"I guess the Chiefs. Would be cool to see Alex Smith have a GOAT playoff run and carry the shit out of his team. It would be even better if he beat the Niners, and for some reason Harbaugh was back and he celebrated right in his face. Smith's gone through a lot of shit, and he's in the AFC now, so I have no conflicting feelings. He deserves it, and so do Hali and Charles."
Mclovin_21,"He""d bench Garoppolo and play their 3rd stringer and win an AFCCG"
Mclovin_21,I meant too tall.
Mclovin_21,Surely you guys have a better LT than Bahktiari. He's really not that good...
Mclovin_21,Because real stadiums have real grass and only losers use turf.
Mclovin_21,"I don't think you know how it works, and I highly doubt you even read the report. They said specifically that the Patriots organization was basically at no fault, and by using quantifiable terms they are making sure to eliminate error. Based on what they found it's *likely* that Brady knew and was a part of it, not everything is 100% black and white. Innocent people get convicted of crimes, guilty people go free. That's why they do the investigation and leave it up to the NFL to decide what to do."
Mclovin_21,"Neither are that great imo.

The Packers reddit is kind of annoying, no real football discussion, and you get downvoted if you say anything remotely negative about the FO or player performance. And some of the mods are a little... eh.

/r/nfl at least has good football discussion but jesus is the amount of circlejerk ridiculous. Also anything bad or unfavorable about the Seahawks or Pats and some star players (a lot of teams are really touchy about certain players and it really depends if the circlejerk pendulum is for or against that player that particular day) and you get instantly hit by the downvote brigade. Rather than disagree for a reason you get called an idiot for having an unpopular opinion and downvoted for days (I mean really we had a specific ""Unpopular Opinion"" thread and people were  still getting downvoted).

Also people really like to bitch about shitposts on /r/nfl when they can just move on and ignore it. I mean it's the damn offseason, what else is there but shitposts?"
Mclovin_21,"Solid Front 8? We have a decent Dline and horrible LBs. But that's not the problem, you underestimate how bad tolzien is."
Mclovin_21,Yeah I think he's kinda low but I just don't know who I could justify moving down in order to move him up
Mclovin_21,"I think he's better suited to corner. HaHa has much more range and I think Rollins ball skills will be more valuable when he's playing corner. That said I think we're gonna play more base cover 3 this year so it'll be almost like playing safety when we're in cover 3 deep.

Also isn't Smith a FS? Or do you guys not make that much of a discinction and just have left/right safeties?"
Mclovin_21,Their 2013 and 2014 drafts were horrible too. I'm kinda losing faith in Schneider.
Mclovin_21,Janis the Mannis: The GOAT Story
Mclovin_21,Pretty sure it's sudoku.
Mclovin_21,Wilson is safer. Maybe.
Mclovin_21,"It's not that, I think people just underestimate how much Rodgers does."
Mclovin_21,"Broncos Dolphins from this year was pretty good, 2013 NFC championship Seahawks Niners was also a great game."
Mclovin_21,We could go 10-6 and *maybe* squeak into the wildcard spot but it's pretty hard in the NFC so I don't know.
Mclovin_21,Tarkenton
Mclovin_21,Because people like to be needlessly contrarian and anti-hype. At the end of the day it just matters which part of the circlejerk the pendulum is at at the given time.
Mclovin_21,If that's true then Carr must have a way better int per throw percentage. He still threw the TDs and took care of the ball better than any other rookie.
Mclovin_21,ya. Numbers are inflated.
Mclovin_21,He gets discriminated against for being a Lombardi Packer D:
Mclovin_21,"Aaron Rodgers is the best in the NFL at throwing the deep ball, and it's not even close."
Mclovin_21,Whoops my bad.
Mclovin_21,It looks *much* better. But seriously that was like 100 miles an hour for a 10 yard pass.
Mclovin_21,Unpopular opinion: Deion was better than Lott
Mclovin_21,You wouldn't say Lewis is the GOAT?
Mclovin_21,"Mike Daniels is pretty easily one of the better 3-4 DEs in the league, close to top 10 (again, 3-4 DEs only). He doesn't seem to get much coverage but he's our best Dlineman and a beast."
Mclovin_21,"Because Rodgers didn't inflate the balls *after* they were given to the refs. He just likes them pumped up a lot, sometimes they pass, sometimes they are too pumped up and the refs deflate them. Tom Brady is being accused of deflating the balls *after* the refs have checked them. Way different."
Mclovin_21,Just because of one bad pick it doesn't make him a bad evaluator of talent. He's gonna be a HoF GM when he retires.
Mclovin_21,"""Deangelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart cost me my job!"""
Mclovin_21,"Uh, yeah. I could see a Romo argument, but Rodgers was way better than Big Ben. It's not even close."
Mclovin_21,"It's really not that different. In 2004 Manning threw for 49 TDs, in 2007 Brady threw for 50. The TY Law rule was already in effect."
Mclovin_21,I've always liked Tampa 2
Mclovin_21,A-rod.
Mclovin_21,"How am I admitting that and why is it ridiculous? If you're saying that just because we're known that doesn't make us the best, then yes. But that name was from the 30s, even pre Lombardi era, it's not ridiculous considering we won the championship 5 of the first 17 or so years we were in the league and all of them over the span of 10 years."
Mclovin_21,"How come every time I point out Simon was awful eveyone tells me ""No he was awesome he just had a bad game, he could become great!"""
Mclovin_21,"&gt;ILB and CB depth are question marks

Yeah because we didn't just draft two high DBs and already have a very good starter and the best slot corner in the league."
Mclovin_21,Except Browner is pretty unique and is more physical.
Mclovin_21,"To see how people would rank the actual best defenses in the NFL, not to see a bunch of recency bias."
Mclovin_21,He might have been really good but he wasn't more valuable than Aaron Rodgers. Murray was more valuable than him to his team.
Mclovin_21,Good lord these Pats fans...
Mclovin_21,"""The Rams are gonna be *good* next year!"""
Mclovin_21,"Yeah seriously, people saying otherwise must not watch him play. They get the notion that he's big or something and can't be a great route runner but he totally is."
Mclovin_21,Football&gt;gf/family/friends
Mclovin_21,You're so clever! 
Mclovin_21,Yeah that's the reason I made the thread. Been quite awhile since we had one.
Mclovin_21,"I remember watching one of your games. It was like 3rd and 25 on your own 7 yard line or something and you guys did the usual draw play, except this time Foster broke off for like a 40 yard gain and you actually converted. That was cray"
Mclovin_21,"Andre Johnson. He's been one of the most dominant WRs for over a decade, even on a team that has most of the time been mediocre or worse. Always been a class act, does a ton of charity and seems like an overall cool dude. He should get in the Hall, and I hope he does end up in there."
Mclovin_21,"At worst he's 6 or 7. Johnson, Dez, Brown, Julio, Green, DT. No one else really has a case."
Mclovin_21,"Well the Dolphins trashed the Pats week 1 last year, I don't see why they won't do it again. Tannehill is proven."
Mclovin_21,"Nah GB is better atm. Three of your best players coming off of surgery, a shittier Oline than last year, and three terrible drafts in a row don't put you ahead of us."
Mclovin_21,I thought people could use a laugh. Sure got me going lol.
Mclovin_21,"I have this horrible feeling that we won't be able to pay HaHa in 3 years when he earns some crazy contract. Other than that I don't see Lacy finishing his career with us barring (god forbid) some injury.

And I will commit sudoku if Aaron Rodgers ever plays in another uniform."
Mclovin_21,"The Tattoos and hats are fine, he just acts really immature in all his press conferences and seems kind of insecure. Super cocky, too, for someone who also hasn't done that much.

And Okay, but really, a Dolphins hat? You can wear any hat from any team of any other sport except for one of another NFL team. It *is* disrespectful, regardless of what anyone else tells me."
Mclovin_21,Yeah the players even said he gets overlooked by the media and everyone but they definitely recognize him as a force.
Mclovin_21,"No, but almost all the top 5 CBs are on great teams, Haden isn't. That probably has some effect on his performance."
Mclovin_21,"Well if you decide to do it and need a Green Bay writer, feel free to hmu."
Mclovin_21,I had faith until he chose a WR. I'd be fine with literally any other position. Not receiver though.
Mclovin_21,"OBJ, Martin, Mack."
Mclovin_21,"If I *had* to pick, the Bears. They are a storied enough Franchise and as much as I hate them I respect them. And they already have a SB.

The Lions and Vikings can tear their first Lombardi from my lifeless, dead body.

"
Mclovin_21,"Considering the Seahawks allowed like 10 PPG in their last 6 games or so yes 22 points is good, especially in Seattle."
Mclovin_21,"He earned neither of them, but was voted in because of hype. Both years had people who deserved them more."
Mclovin_21,"Ah. Yeah I lived in San Jose, so many ghetto Raiders fans. Most were douchebags but I kinda like the raiders now, I've gotten over how annoying some of the people I knew were. And yeah Living in San Jose we weren't allowed to wear Sharks paraphernalia because of gang stuff. Which sucks cause SJ is thru and thru a hockey town."
Mclovin_21,"Prime Peppers across from 2009 Matthews and 2008 Raji, 2014 Mike Daniels. Jesus the opposing QBs would be ded.

We'd still have hella shit LBs though."
Mclovin_21,"Except Malcom Butler won the game for him and half the ""leagues best defense"" needed surgery but still kept playing."
Mclovin_21,It's not like 10-1 is bad though.
Mclovin_21,Yeah because allowing 37 points in the playoffs is so good? Or how about the next year when they allowed 45? Or in 2009 when they allowed 51?
Mclovin_21,Hence why I said at least. 12 other QBs in the league could get the team to the playoffs and win the SB.
Mclovin_21,"I think they are underrated. Could have one of the best offenses in the league, and call me crazy but I think Luck is the best young QB to ever come out of college, and he's entering his 4th year which has typically been around the time elite QBs win MVP."
Mclovin_21,Andrew Luck.
Mclovin_21,Dunno how to do that.
Mclovin_21,You could minus all their weathers from zero and it still wouldn't be as cold as Lambeau!
Mclovin_21,"I'd love to put him on a list, because he's easily the best slot corner in the league, just can't put him over anyone else. And it's even hard to put him over Shields, because while he might be better at his position than Shields, Shields is till an outside corner."
Mclovin_21,He could have done just as bad for the 4 games he was out as his first couple games. He would have hit the rookie wall and dropped off in production. Victor Cruz might not have gotten injured. Everything changes.
Mclovin_21,Mathis and Sitton are on the same level as Yanda. Him having one amazing year doesn't skyrocket him ridiculously far past them both.
Mclovin_21,Those *are* cheating. I was literally just talking about PEDs. I think everyone should be punished if they cheat.
Mclovin_21,"Obviously not considering he scored zero points with lane in the game.  How Seattle's offense did is moot. You played on a neutral field against 3 extremely injured DBs, and nother one that was sent out of the game and replaced by a horrible backup and then you claim that Tom Brady ""toasted"" them even though he still threw 2 picks."
Mclovin_21,Well no shit.
Mclovin_21,"Eh, I don't think he's that hyped compared to some other people. I just think people see his potential and are excited."
Mclovin_21,Will you be stalking me? Like a... jungle cat?
Mclovin_21,"Burnett going down would fuck our team entirely. It's no coincidence that Kaepernicks best ever passing day coincided with one of the only times Burnett was out for us (it was also because we keyed in on the run too much, but I can tell you a good chunk of it was Burnett being out). He's the leader of our Defense and the most vital piece in pretty much both our run stopping and pass defending. Without him we'd be a bottom 10 defense I think."
Mclovin_21,"Literally stickem, can't be GOAT. We all like Randy Moss now, right?"
Mclovin_21,Making the playoffs isn't the goal.
Mclovin_21,10 million definitely isn't an overpay for someone that young. He'd make $12 mil on the market.
Mclovin_21,Hilton but no Cobb? D:
Mclovin_21,"We'd have Tony Romo, Montee Ball, a bomb ass Oline, JJ Watt. Wouldn't be too bad."
Mclovin_21,I liked him before he lied about the fail Mary but not gonna lie now I obviously don't.
Mclovin_21,Jim Taylor? Ahman Green? Paul Hornug?
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, he's taller, bigger, heavier, stronger, faster than ever single person on every team he played. It's ridiculous that such a great athletic specimen exists. Dude is a once in a lifetime talent."
Mclovin_21,"I'd take Edelman over Tate in a heartbeat, but that's personal preference, I could see him being above Edelman. But Tate imo didn't really do anything special outside of when CJ was injured and he was the No1 target. Sanders and Cobb never had that opportunity to be the No1 and still had better years than him. Cobb especially, seeing as how Stafford threw the ball 80 more times than Rodgers. 8 more catches on 15 more targets with 50 more yards and 8 less TDs doesn't make him better than Cobb. I don't know how that's even an argument. Sanders had more yards, twice as many TDs, a higher average yards per catch on the same amount of targets"
Mclovin_21,"No, it a not the same. I get what you're trying to do but you're just flat out wrong. Dumb equivalency and dumb point."
Mclovin_21,Andrew Luck? Brady will probably still be it though until he retires.
Mclovin_21,I'd be sad if he never did. He was the 2000s imo. No one else had been so consistently good for so long. Only Wayne compares.
Mclovin_21,"Ah, the Texans. The talent factory."
Mclovin_21,Wow That's crazy big if that's true. 
Mclovin_21,"""I told you he's too soft!"" - Michael Bennett"
Mclovin_21,"For no/unknown/random chance reason? A-rod. He probably has the highest talent:how far he dropped ratio.

For off the field issues or an actual reason? Then Alfonso Dennard or Vontaze Burfict."
Mclovin_21,Say what you want but I think this kid just might have a future in football!
Mclovin_21,Not as debatable as what you said.
Mclovin_21,10 other QBs could win a SB with Seattle. Is Trent Dilfer amazing because he won one with the Ravens?
Mclovin_21,Yeah but Martin plays for the Cowboys. Basically anyone who plays there is under the spotlight. Rookies on smaller or more secluded teams like the Buccs or Titans or hell even the Packers don't get as much recognition.
Mclovin_21,"Carr. I liked him better last year, I like him better this year."
Mclovin_21,Run up the middle for a 2 yard gain.
Mclovin_21,Well that's certainly one way to console someone.
Mclovin_21,He's have to throw 10 TDs and 0 ints and go 4-0 for BB to even consider it.
Mclovin_21,They also had 50 more targets and Manning threw 80 more times than Rodgers.
Mclovin_21,"I mean, did you read the report?"
Mclovin_21,McCourty alone though is so good. I think they at least deserve an honorable mention.
Mclovin_21,The fail mary game was awful the entire game. So bad...
Mclovin_21,I mean he probably has the GOAT LB last name. He has to be worth it!
Mclovin_21,Why? That was a dumb rule.
Mclovin_21,I think so. The only other you could argue ahead of him are Byrd (who I mentioned) and maybe Whitner or Nelson. But I think he had a better year than all three of those guys so I put him there. It also helps that he's the best run stopping SS in the league.
Mclovin_21,"*Sigh*...

The catch 2

Jerry Rice fumble

4th and 26

Fail Mary

Bostick fumble

Hail Saint PATer

Cardinals face mask

**Take your pick**"
Mclovin_21,I have Vietnam flashbacks of the shotgun toss for no yards.
Mclovin_21,For top prospects? RB. Don't know how Richardson did it. It's the easiest position to play.
Mclovin_21,That game was pretty crazy. Rodgers last drive though was just insane.
Mclovin_21,"That's fair, I just think no one was on Moss' level. He was amazing, and did most of his work with mediocre QBs compared to the HoFers Rice had."
Mclovin_21,Capers could be if we have a horrendous defensem I'd say if we missed the playoffs McCarthy could be too.
Mclovin_21,21 is the GOAT number for Rbs and DBs.
Mclovin_21,"The NFL doesn't exist anymore? Wow, I learned something to day. You're getting mad at me for a title for our home town that was *coined before any of us was even born*. Like I said. We had and currently had the most titles, so we got called titletown. That's just how it goes."
Mclovin_21,Why are the Colts winning?
Mclovin_21,Teams prepare their own balls even for away games.
Mclovin_21,I always likes Jimmy Goatgoatgoat
Mclovin_21,Damn that was good. Got the Chills. Even after they mentioned 4th and 26 T.T
Mclovin_21,Raji didn't even play and Guion was graded a top NT several times throughout the year by PFF.
Mclovin_21,"Not sure if they are top 5 yet, I'm sure they will be in 2015, but Morgan Burnett and HaHa Clinton-Dix (some Micah Hyde in there, too) were pretty damn good last year. Definitely one of the reasons our pass defense went from shit in 2013 to top 10 in 2014.

ETIII and Kam are the best safety duo in football though. Other than that, the Patriots, Lions, Chargers (really only Weddle, anyone with him looks good), Browns all have superb safety tandems.

Edit: And I forgot about Reid + Bethea, that's a pretty beast combo, especially when Reid is fully healthy."
Mclovin_21,"Lol we're part of ""Cheapsgate"" because three of our players have ever been fined for a hit? That's some dumb ass shit. Some of it's interesting but the rest is garbage.

Also, inflategate on the whole Aaron Rodgers thing? It's like the author went out of their way to be uninformed."
Mclovin_21,"I don't think it's flawed. Of course a QB will get it most of the time, they are the most valuable. It's just like pitchers in the MLB, it should be special if they (or another position in football) win it. Most people who bitch about who wins it seem to forget that it's for the most *valuable* player, not necessarily the best. I don't see why DPOTY or OPOTY isn't enough for the best players on offense or defense."
Mclovin_21,"He was about to win the fucking game before Williams fumbled twice. His receivers didn't do jack shit all game, his Oline didn't do jack shit all game, his defense didn't do *that* well, and his run game wasn't very impressive. He threw 2 TDs and 0 ints, not sure what else you want him to do with a nobody version of crabtree and a handful of receivers that aren't even playing anymore."
Mclovin_21,I *really* hope Quinten Rollins is up there. He looks like he's gonna be a stud.
Mclovin_21,Not a HoFer...
Mclovin_21,Why do you have a Bucs flair then? Jw.
Mclovin_21,Most WWF players actually incredible athletes. I think you mean golfers.
Mclovin_21,"It evens out with him being 17 that one time. Plenty of Qbs are just as good and won't make it, so I wouldn't be too upset."
Mclovin_21,"Holy shit someone actually talked about Sam Shields. That never happens. I think Burnett is better though, so I don't know why they'd leave him off."
Mclovin_21,"Oh god, Goodell clapping was so cringeworthy."
Mclovin_21,"Hopefully 3 for each. I think Rodgers with 3 Rings, two of them SB MVP along with his regular season achievements would put him at a very real spot to be the GOAT."
Mclovin_21,"top 5 run game in the final few weeks of the season, and a top 10 run game for the entire year. And just because Wilson is really good doesn't mean he's carrying the team (quite the opposite). I'm not saying Tom Brady was being carried obviously but he definitely had a good amount of help, moreso than average QBs would all over the league."
Mclovin_21,This aint the AFC. 11-5 or you're out.
Mclovin_21,ETIII or Aaron Rodgers. I'd love to see what they see and why they are so good.
Mclovin_21,You forget they've been resting the GOAT for a year. We're about ready to release him on the world. Don't be surprised when Janis moves up to No1 on the depth chart this year!
Mclovin_21,"I think he'll end up as the #2 by midway through the season at least.

Edit: Wait Lewis is on the Ravens now"
Mclovin_21,He hasn't done anything particularly special to us yet so I'm not sure.
Mclovin_21,"Ray Rice was drunk and hit his fiance *once* (whom he later married btw), then his trial was completely botched by the league and now his career is destroyed. Not a good comparison to breaking the rules in an NFL championship game."
Mclovin_21,"&gt;Blameis Winston

FTFY"
Mclovin_21,Rodgers is gonna play past 35 no question. We have 8 years left I'd say.
Mclovin_21,Are you an Egyptian crocodile by any chance?
Mclovin_21,Statistically 1 in every 3 teams has one. Not that rare.
Mclovin_21,Yeah that's what I mean.
Mclovin_21,"Nah we signed Raji and Guion again, who's moving back to NT. Our Dline is fine. Also shored up our secondary and still have the same 11 starters from last year on offense. We also had a decent draft. Not great or flashy but definitely not a poor one."
Mclovin_21,"Because it's Aaron Rodgers' world and we're all just living in it. He's the best in the league and it's not particularly close. We were a shitty special teams play away from the SB (and imo being the favorites to win it). We massively upgraded our ST, so that should be fixed. We have a borderline elite secondary with a ton of young players just begging to break out or already at pro-bowl and all-pro potential. Our offense is going to have the exact same lineup for two years in a row, which is major for chemistry. We should be the No1 socring offense this year, and if our defense sniffs out top 10 in scoring or even top 5 if we're lucky then there's really no stopping us from the first seed and destroying the playoffs.

We don't lose at Lambeau."
Mclovin_21,"It's okay. I don't expect anything else. They can say ""that wasn't the point"" all they want but they know they were bragging and are just salty."
Mclovin_21,It's a shame they cancelled the rest of the playoffs at the 55 minute mark. I guess we'll never know what would have happened.
Mclovin_21,I think he's gonna be a corner.
Mclovin_21,"&gt; What if Favre doesn't throw that interception against the Giants* in the 2007* NFC Championship?

FTFY D:"
Mclovin_21,I'm not saying that. But any average QB could win at least 8 games with the Seahawks.
Mclovin_21,How am I taking him for granted? If I had to swap someone between him and Arod no doubt I'm swapping him. Both are still the best qb and coach in the division undoubtedly.
Mclovin_21,"Alright, fair enough. For the record I think Wilson is a great Qb and will end up elite, but I just think for 2013 several other QBs could have done almost as well or equally good."
Mclovin_21,"Just really not that much power. I assume that over 50% of the people who watch football and buy things are ""casual"" fans (I mean they can still be diehard, but casual in the sense of analysis or whatnot). The people on reddit may realize this, but that's only because they are big fans of football as a game as opposed to just their teams so they care more about what the NFL is doing. Overall we're a minority with not that much power."
Mclovin_21,"You seem really entitled to wins. Don't take them for granted, they are harder to get than you think."
Mclovin_21,Really? How do you know?
Mclovin_21,"Alright, sounds good."
Mclovin_21,"Jay Cutler is way better than people realize, if it wasn't for his age I'd definitely take him in a heart beat over some unproven rookie. Plenty of teams would kill for a 4k, 30td passer."
Mclovin_21,Holy shit people keep spouting that argument without even knowing wtf they are talking about. Not even remotely the same.
Mclovin_21,"In 2012 for the DROTY, Casey Hayward should have won, he was statistically the best corner in the league. Not just of rookies, but the entire league. He allowed the lowest passer rating of any corner since 2007.

In 2013 for DPOTY, ETIII, JJ Watt, Navorro Bowman, and Robert Quinn all had better cases and years than Kuechly."
Mclovin_21,"Oh, no, I more meant how he was heavily criticized for losing another SB. I'm sure Brady would be a bit too."
Mclovin_21,"No, all three of them are on the fringe, and I didn't put it in order. The only thing is Tomlin missed the playoffs twice, which kinda knocks him."
Mclovin_21,"Peyton Manning set the completion record the year before in the 43-8 Blowlout loss, it really isn't anything to brag about."
Mclovin_21,"I know Dwayne Bowe in real life, his nickname is ""no one"". You had to have been there..."
Mclovin_21,His receivers and Oline made him look average. Dropsies and sacks all around. We always lose when fucking Bulaga gets injured.
Mclovin_21,&gt;Jimmy G sighs dramatically off in the distance as yet another person spells his name wrong...
Mclovin_21,"Tom Brady, 4 time SB Winner*"
Mclovin_21,"Robber on defense, and then obviously just an eligable receiver, maybe a FB would be used more often."
Mclovin_21,"It's always the last one, but this past NFCCG was the worst in my memory. Worse than 2007, worse than Brett Favre leaving. It was awful."
Mclovin_21,Is that seriously why? I always wondered why Howard just never practiced or something. Multimillion dollar athlete and you can't just improve your free throw shooting? I guess I get it now. TIL
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, you're right. Maybe even too ridiculous that it couldn't even be a fictional movie. Certainly no producer would ever think such an insane scenario could ever happen!"
Mclovin_21,I'm *waaaaay* too lazy for this.
Mclovin_21,"Nope it's really not that great. The best it is is a *general* indicator of how people played, but a ton of grades are just flat our wrong or really sensationalized. Ask any coach and they'll say tape is really subjective.

Also star players get graded way differently than unknowns. Unknowns tend to have less biased grades whereas star players can fluctuate due to the grader either not liking or really liking the player."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah I don't think so either. SB wins are a team stat imo, obviously a QB can do really well and influence it the most but still you need the entire team to be good. Brady might be my No1 ever but I just don't think that *right now* he's the best."
Mclovin_21,"The Jags could play in the 70s and 80s and murder people, everyone could.

#2010 Steelers

14.5 PPG, 276 YPG

#2009 Jets

14.8 PPG 251 YPG

#2008 Steelers

13.9 PPG ***237 YPG***

#2006 Ravens

***12.6 PPG*** 264 YPG

The Seahawks aren't *that* special.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great defense. And I realize the rules have changed a tad and offenses are more favored now, but it hasn't shifted *so* much that these numbers are meaningless compared to now."
Mclovin_21,Jw what team are you a fan of? You have no flair.
Mclovin_21,Smitty?
Mclovin_21,What was it?
Mclovin_21,I'm gonna guess that OBJ will decline. I'm still not sold on him being the best WR in the history of the league.
Mclovin_21,Alshon Jeffery.
Mclovin_21,Great argument lol. Attack my team when you can't refute what I'm saying. What happened the last time the Pats played the Packers in the SB? Oh yeah they got their asses kicked. Good times. 20 years ago seems like it was almost yesterday.
Mclovin_21,"I don't doubt that he's made some late hits, but I think he also gets scrutinized for things he'd have no way of avoiding."
Mclovin_21,"They do because he's not gonna specifically target someone else more times than them. They are just gonna naturally get more targets over time, which is what happened."
Mclovin_21,Maybe not that much respect.
Mclovin_21,That's exactly what I think. That kind of ball skill and instinct together is pretty uncanny. That guy's a rare talent. And his tackling and hitting are amazing for someone who played basketball for 4 years. Not afraid *at all* of making the big hit. He'll be a stud.
Mclovin_21,"Well considering he had a better year than 2 or 3 of those guys there's an argument. I'm not saying he is, just that it's arguable."
Mclovin_21,Gotta admit I lol'd
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, and I'm not saying Brady doesn't, but Rodgers definitely has fun playing football, and he wants to win."
Mclovin_21,The punishment for Tom Brady or just the Pats organization?
Mclovin_21,"Not sure why you got downvoted, but yeah that was awesome."
Mclovin_21,Reunited with the Broncos?
Mclovin_21,B. Kelly is underrated and Rice and Sanders are the GOAT at their position. I don't think Sharpe is.
Mclovin_21,"Why would he not even be close? 7 years a starter, multiple MVPs, Sb win, SB MVP, highest passer rating in NFL history. Jw."
Mclovin_21,They wouldn't have been behind in those games if Alex was playing.
Mclovin_21,SB I rematch would be cool in SB 50
Mclovin_21,"Let me try.

""Tom Brady is the GOAT and it's not even close and Russell Wilson is an elite, top 5 QB.""

Did it work?"
Mclovin_21,I'm excited as fuck for our ST to actually be good. Also I'm really high on Rollins. He's gonna be the next star to emerge on our D (other than HHCD if you count him already).
Mclovin_21,He didn't try to deceive anything. Every ball he wanted to be inflated heavily was checked by the ref and given an okay. If not they would deflate them. You don't know what you're talking about.
Mclovin_21,Not really. Everything I said in the original comment is spot on. I don't expect anything otherwise though anyway because this sub is patrolled by the Seahawks and Pats downvote brigade every day.
Mclovin_21,Kraft falls to mid to late 2nd round in 12 man leagues
Mclovin_21,Yeah fair enough
Mclovin_21,"Melvin Gordon is gonna be the next 2k rusher. I called it a year ago, I still think it now. 

Other than that, my homer  pick is Quinten Rollins (pls). I think his max potential from what I've seen (he only played a year in college, there's not much to go off on) is nearish to Charles Woodson. He's just as likely to suck forever and be a complete bust though. He'll ~~hopefully~~ probably end up somewhere in between. We'll see how he does next year."
Mclovin_21,I feel like we've never not drafted a WR or CB in the 2nd.
Mclovin_21,"Maybe, but the NFC is extremely hard to get into through the wildcard spot. The lowest it's been in recent years is 10-6. IT's completely different than the AFC with strong division leaders and weaker wildcard teams."
Mclovin_21,I don't really like adjusted value averages.
Mclovin_21,"I'm not saying that isn't awesome, and it's not really Brady's fault, but neither of the drives would have mattered if Butler didn't get an int. That was the game winning play."
Mclovin_21,....Then why do you have a NYG flair?
Mclovin_21,Quinten Rollins will win DROTY.
Mclovin_21,I forgot about him but yeah. The point is that I have no clue how Kuechly won other than hype.
Mclovin_21,"How? Saying Brett Favre has all the volume records isn't a bad thing, it means he was awesome and played forever. That doesn't make him the GOAT though."
Mclovin_21,"If you take all that stuff into account then Andrew Luck and it's not even close. He's still on a rookie contract and he's the best young QB in the league, and one of the best to ever come out of college. "
Mclovin_21,"He didn't really choke, especially considering on the last three possessions he either didn't even throw the ball, threw the ball and was dropped by his TE, aor drove down the field for a game tying field goal.

Not that he played well but *he* didn't really choke."
Mclovin_21,"The context tho. Doesn't change that he wasn't better than any of those guys, even if you down vote me."
Mclovin_21,"Even then. Sometimes your defense blows it and you say something like ""This Capers defense is gonna cost us the game"" and everyone lashes out at you. Then the other team leads a game winning drive and you're like ""Well, shit."""
Mclovin_21,"That was seriously one of the worst cases of injuries I've seen in a playoff game. You guys had no one on offense and were still rocking it, then everyone on your defense died."
Mclovin_21,"Best: Bears @Lambeau. Pretty much the most domination you could possibly do in the first half.

Worst: Week 3 @Lions. Only 7 points on offense and they scored 9 points alone on defense."
Mclovin_21,It's just the WR pick. It's a little baffling.
Mclovin_21,"&gt;""This just in, Tom Brady has been suspended for week 3, 4, 9 and 15. Definitely not sketchy at all, even if those are the games against the Jags, Titans and Redskins, and one of them is a bye."""
Mclovin_21,Nah we'd win 9 or 10 games with Dalton. We aren't as bad as we were in 2013 (we were also super injured).
Mclovin_21,"Devin Hester scored his first rushing TD, broke the return TD record, and forced his first fumble all in the same game, on the Falcons!"
Mclovin_21,Unpopular opinion: The Seahawks. They are in prime position to get usurped by the other teams in the division. Their line is suspect and their best players are coming off of serious injuries. I think that'll result in them getting a lower seed and being ousted during the divisional round.
Mclovin_21,I'm glad I'm subscribed to /r/EddieLacyfacts
Mclovin_21,I wasn't saying he's top 5.
Mclovin_21,"I thought just for the first half he was actually the playcaller, then after that he just did like you said."
Mclovin_21,"[Yeah, cause SB completions totally matter, right?](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/2/2/5372516/peyton-manning-super-bowl-record-broncos-seahawks) Terrible argument. They are an excuse when you're trying to brag that you beat the best _____ when you weren't even really playing them."
Mclovin_21,Is that like mega super jumbo?
Mclovin_21,Mean Joe Green and Joe Namath had the two best commercials *of all time*.
Mclovin_21,"I just don't think so. I think there's a sizable gap between the teams in the NFC and the AFC. If the playoffs weren't separated by conference, I'd be willing to bet that two NFC teams would make the SB 9/10 times. Obviously I don't *know* what's going to happen, but judging from last years teams the only championship caliber teams were the Seahawks, Pats, Packers, and Cowboys. The Pats have declined so I think they are out of that now.

Again I could be completely wrong but that's just my opinion."
Mclovin_21,In Madden once my guy intercepted the toss and ran it back to the house. I also use intercepted an option for like an 80 yard TD.
Mclovin_21,He can rush for 200 yards every game *other* than against us. Then he can have like 40.
Mclovin_21,"The first time we've made it there since the Super Bowl 5 years ago. So yeah, we've continually exited early."
Mclovin_21,"I agree with most of your list. But there's no way in hell that the Seahawks are top 10 let alone 6th. They are like 6th in just the 2000s imo. And the way you qualified it isn't that amazing, the Steelers allowed fewer PPG just the year before."
Mclovin_21,One hit ever?
Mclovin_21,I'm arguing with everyone! I argue with whoever I damn well please!
Mclovin_21,"""Well fuck you too, buddy."" -Raiders"
Mclovin_21,"I think Rodgers could go first depending on the goal of the GM (ie build a franchise or just immediately win a SB), but either way you don't really go wrong."
Mclovin_21,"You're right, I'm an idiot. I have no clue why I put DeAngelo."
Mclovin_21,"I think Kelvin Benjamin was the worst receiver drafted in the first round. A ton of his stats came in garbage time and he really wasn't anything *that* special compared to the other rookies. I think Evans, OBJ, and Watkins are all easily better than him."
Mclovin_21,"Best: 14-2 win the SB pretty easily on the back of home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Rodgers has another MVP caliber year and a ton of the young potential starts on our defense break out and make the leap.

Worst (I'm gonna assume for the sake of this Rodgers doesn't miss any games): Another year with a ton of injuries to the rest of the team, we go 8-8 and miss the playoffs. Defense ends up being awful because two of our corners walked and all our ILB depth is gone. None of the rookie pan out and we give upa shit ton of points."
Mclovin_21,"Quinten Rollins. He's only played a year of CB in college but he has a crazy ass highlight reel and he can really only get better with experience. A 2nd rounder after a year of starting is pretty insane, he'd probably a be a 1st rounder with another year or even a top 10 with multiple years (again that's assuming the experience would help him improve). He has all the physical and mental attributes to succeed, just needs experience."
Mclovin_21,"Personally I'd only take '84 Marino over Rodgers 2011, so it's different for every person."
Mclovin_21,"You could try to make a 32/32 and get people to volunteer as writers. Tons of people would offer to write for you, I'm sure. "
Mclovin_21,"They did play every well in the SB, that's one of the best SB wins in recent memory, I'll give you that. But they allowed still allowed 13ish PPG in the playoffs, which while good isn't amazing. For example the 2011 Giants allowed 14 PPG in the postseason, and they are nowhere near being a GOAT defense. Maybe to people who've watched football for less than 3 years. I will give it that it's one of the best defenses in recent memory, but anyone who's watched football for most of the 2000s will tell you that the defenses I mentioned were just as good if not better than the Seahawks, and they really have no case against some of the older defenses in history like the 85 Bears, 72 dolphins, multiple steelers and Niners defenses, the 65 Packers, etc."
Mclovin_21,Because this dude has no clue what he's talking about.
Mclovin_21,"20 is basically nothing though. If you allow less than 24 points you have a way higher chance of winning than if you allow above it. Not saying Eli didn't do anything, I mean he scored 3 TDs on our terrible defense but it is much easier nomatter what when the other team doesn't even get 3 TDs."
Mclovin_21,"I don't think he's 12th, I think he's around 8th or 9th but I'm just saying I think a couple other worse QBs could have almost as much success. And yeah I guess that's a fair point."
Mclovin_21,"Lol. Seahawks at No1 when they lost Maxwell, gave away Unger and a 1st rounder, have 3 of their best players coming off of surgery and a mediocre draft? Jesus."
Mclovin_21,"I think Moss had better hands, and it's not like he was bad at anything either. He was one of the top route runners of all time even if he wasn't better than Rice, and best deep ball threat in the history of the league."
Mclovin_21,"1. Brady gets suspended for 4 games but appeals it to 2

2. Garoppolo splits Brady's absent games, the Patriots go 11-5 and win the division.

3. Dolphins finish above .500 but still miss the playoffs.

4. The Jets still pick top 10 in the draft

5. The AFC East has the NFL's yardage leader in *both* rushing and receiving."
Mclovin_21,"I assume someone slips everyone now and then. Great defense play but that would be a ""slip"" in boxing if they were playing that."
Mclovin_21,"Great evaluation. ""You're not actually the president of the US so you can't have an opinion on what he's doing"". We've had 30 years of HoF QBs and 2 SBs. Playoffs don't cut it for a team this talented."
Mclovin_21,"Varsity blues is the GOAT comedyish football movie, but Remember the Titans is pretty darn good overall, too.

Honorable mention goes to When the Game Stands Tall"
Mclovin_21,I still think RG3 will be good. He could still end up being worth the trade.
Mclovin_21,Luck isn't a runner but he is definitely mobile. He had the same combine times as Cam Newton.
Mclovin_21,"I almost never question TT, he had a great past two drafts. But a WR is just too weird."
Mclovin_21,"Kevin Johnson, Benardrick McKinney. Damn you Houston! I knew they'd take Jaelen Strong too!

In other news, apparently I could be the GM for the Texans."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah that's about right. It was utterly ridiculous how injured we were in 2013, finally with some good health we were able to get work done."
Mclovin_21,What the fuck Favre? What. the. Fuck.
Mclovin_21,Gordon gonna be a beast.
Mclovin_21,"I edited that in to make it more clear, haha. But that's what I meant anyway. I see how I didn't phrase it very well. I just think Arians has done a lot considering his Qb keeps getting injured and he's still had one of the best teams in the league for most of the season."
Mclovin_21,"It's not that his passer rating is really damn good, it's that it's *miles* ahead of the next closest person. If passer rating is so inflated now how come he's the only one who has such a high number?"
Mclovin_21,[Al Harris!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAgG9XcrDFY)
Mclovin_21,"Yeah because having the 8th ranked scoring defense is nothing, right? Holding the other team to 7 points in the AFC championship is mediocre. He played a ridiculously injured shell of the LoB on a neutral field and still even then did nothing until their 3rd string CB went out of the game with an injury. His team won him the SB, he might have had a big part of it, but like I said, defense wins championships, not QBs."
Mclovin_21,"Maybe, who knows. But they at least don't regularly cheat or regularly get caught. Something is fishy in NE."
Mclovin_21,"Lacy seems like a pretty cool dude, I feel like we'd have awesome madden tournaments or something. His personality seems closer to that of the people my age than most of the other people on the team.

Also, bonus player not on my team: Tony Romo. He seems like the kinda guy who it'd be fun to have a beer with. [And that smile, tho.](http://giant.gfycat.com/InferiorIncredibleFoxterrier.gif)"

I tried to think of the most important factors"
Mclovin_21,"Uh, no. Rodgers had a higher average yards per attempt, 6 more TDs,  4 less ints, a 10 point higher passer rating, more wins, a farther trip into the playoffs and was MVP. Ben threw for more passes and had Less TDs. There's no argument where Ben is better than Rodgers in 2014."
Mclovin_21,"It's not what he cheated to do, it's the fact that he did it and how he did it."
Mclovin_21,"Tom Brady, with Romo a close 3rd."
Mclovin_21,I don't need to be a time traveler to know we didn't need a receiver whatsoever.
Mclovin_21,"It's just so funny because the linebacker stops and you can tell he's like ""wtf is he doing? Should I be waiting for a read option or something?"""
Mclovin_21,I hope not. Personally I think Kevin Johnson is gonna be awesome across from J. Joe. I could see them being one of the best CB tandems in the league next year.
Mclovin_21,"BJ Raji, Sean Lee, Jairus Byrd."
Mclovin_21,5 extra sacks a season is something I'll take if I get just as good QB play with mobility and better accuracy.
Mclovin_21,"Them being on there is recency bias. I *do* think they have a case as a collective group over a couple years, don't get me wrong, but as far as an individual defense one year I don't think they are up there."
Mclovin_21,"Hate doesn't have to include bad sportsmanship and shitty regard for human decency. The NFCW has nothing, none of those rivalries are even remotely formed at the same level as maybe even every other division in the league."
Mclovin_21,"Nah, The Broncos, Colts, and Packers are all up there. A receiver that hasn't played a down in the NFL doesn't make them instantly the best."
Mclovin_21,"&gt; Eli dragged the 2011 giants to a SB

Yeah cause his defense allowing less than 13 PPG in the playoffs against the 3 of the highest scoring offenses in the league certainly didn't have anything to do with it. Obviously he was super clutch but seriously, his defense was a bigger part of the run than he was in every game besides the SB."
Mclovin_21,"4k yards rookie year, leading the team to the playoffs. He also had a ton of game winning drives and his team waas awful. Pretty great year. And he went to the pro bowl so by definition he was a probowl QB."
Mclovin_21,I like yours.
Mclovin_21,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think Randy Moss was better than Rice ever was, but maybe not greater. Rice has 3 SB rings and a shit ton of volume stats. But just because he played forever doesn't mean he was better than Moss."
Mclovin_21,"Actually I'm sorry, he was only an honorable mention. He just didn't get full playing time, especially during his junior year where he mostly played on special teams."
Mclovin_21,"[""I played the '85 bears in '86""](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/0DB4203B2C1119514249535045632_22a028a32af.5.1.5007832362269498547.mp4?versionId=At85iOwtUVDkKWUZ8UA0_R5oCDpSQ.ik)"
Mclovin_21,L O fucking L. This is literally the best thing ever. Imagine if Rodgers could get even better.
Mclovin_21,I think Lacy is close enough. Dude's a beast. 
Mclovin_21,"Uh, he took a 2-14 team to 11-5 and the playoffs. It doesn't get much better than that. He had one of the greatest rookie seasons in quite a long time."
Mclovin_21,For what it's worth I think you guys would have destroyed the Cards or Panthers were you to get a seed that would pit you against them.
Mclovin_21,"Who's better than him? BB isn't the greatest GM, Ozzie Newsome is good but he's not leaps and bounds ahead of TT. Schneider just had two horrible drafts in a row and he hasn't even had to sign any of the star players he drafted, and had a terrible trade with the Vikings. John   Elway is pretty good too, but again not leaps and bounds ahead of TT.

And as for picks, he's picked the best QB of the era, several All-pros, an currently has one of the most talented rosters in the league."
Mclovin_21,"I guess, but that's pretty shitty for Mett."
Mclovin_21,"How many Lombardi's do you guys have? Oh, zero? That's too bad. McCarthy has one."
Mclovin_21,"Gurley is also injured. Obviously He's the better back, but I don't know how he's gonna comeback from injury. I don't know why I get downvoted for saying my opinion."
Mclovin_21,He didn't have to do anything in the playoffs. That's why he threw no ints.
Mclovin_21,Cowboys.
Mclovin_21,You're insane if you think he would have had 1800 yards and 16 TDs if he played the whole season.
Mclovin_21,Why is there a Rangers Jersey? I'm critically uninformed.
Mclovin_21,Yeah Rodgers humor is pretty dry and it's hilarious.
Mclovin_21,Oh I thought you meant on /r/nfl. I was trying to come up with a bunch of ways.
Mclovin_21,McCarthy needs to take a hint from the 2007 Pats.
Mclovin_21,"Hey, you guys have way better TEs!"
Mclovin_21,They still scored 28 points. They hadn't even scored more than 24 points in the last 6 games of the regular season.
Mclovin_21,"2011 felt like it, but we were blinded by our offense as to how bad our defense was.

2012 really didn't feel like our year imo. We were weak in a conference full of juggernauts.

By all accounts we shouldn't have even been in the playoffs in 2013.  We wanted a cinderella story because of how magical the season was and the fire in our injured, hobbled defense, but I think we all knew it wasn't gonna happen as soon as Hyde dropped the int. 

2014 we should have won it honestly, and we all know that. We beat the Seahawks for 55 minutes and we were 5 minutes and a complete bed shitting from beating a team we had beat already earlier in the year.

2015 is make or break. This is by all accounts the best chance we'll probably ever have to get Rodgers another ring. This is the ""we *will*"" year."
Mclovin_21,Maybe it's cause you're both crazy. The  dude didn't even have the *chance* to get to the rookie wall. He's not top 10 right now. Obviously he could be but not even a full season doesn't get you a spot.
Mclovin_21,It's too bad that Aaron Rodgers guy never panned out. 
Mclovin_21,"Well they have a shittier Oline and their best players are coming off of serious injuries. They did add Graham though. But last year they got outplayed quite a bit in the playoffs and needed a little more than several miracles to get to the dance, can they do it again?"
Mclovin_21,"Except none of the elite CBs are on the Raiders, Buccs, Jaguars for a reason."
Mclovin_21,Not a chance in hell. They would have to win 11 games. They are much closer to the first pick in the draft than 11 wins.
Mclovin_21,Did you know we own the Packers?
Mclovin_21,Fair enough. At least this time the fluky play didn't kill you!
Mclovin_21,Dude Rollins is gonna be *sick*. That kid has some serious potential. His highlight reel is insane for one year of playing. I'm on the max speed hype train for him.
Mclovin_21,TBH I don't want to catch a pass in the middle of the field with Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson bearing to me on both sides.
Mclovin_21,The Bears (hopefully).
Mclovin_21,"Derek Carr lacks height? He's 6'3, how much else do you want?"
Mclovin_21,"Suh, JJ Watt, McCoy, Quinn"
Mclovin_21,Tell me what does Skip Bayless think of all this?
Mclovin_21,BJ Raji and Byron Jones. Personally I would not want a 350 pound man with a 3.94 shuttle leaping 12 feet across the turf trying to get at the QB.
Mclovin_21,"I don't know where people get that even. Not trying to be a homer but literally everyone I've ever talked to that's met him said he was pretty nice and friendly. He does tons of charity work and seems pretty cool, though he is a tad cocky. But that comes with being the best QB in the league and it makes him more interesting imo."
Mclovin_21,"&gt;Kaepin it classy.

FTFY"
Mclovin_21,That why A-rod will play into his 40s (pls D:)
Mclovin_21,For every bad pick he has an amazing one. He's definitely top 3.
Mclovin_21,"""High school football is more important and emotional than college and professional football"" -Our terrible center on our terrible ass C-division non-football highschool football team"
Mclovin_21,"We literally only draft, only 2 people are FAs, you don't know what you're talking about"
Mclovin_21,"Maybe Williams will help him out. He was a big leader for us when he played here. I hope you guys do really well. Honestly the potential in your secondary could make you one of the best in the league, if the rest of your defense figures itself out."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah I think so. I just meant nothing like Xavier Rhodes, Sam Shields,  etc who are already decently well known (Shields) or expected to break out and be awesome (Rhodes)."
Mclovin_21,Maybe the only one but we were awful
Mclovin_21,JJ Watt. How could you not love the Badger from Wisconsin? And the dude is the definition of professional. Love me some JJ Watt.
Mclovin_21,Matt Hasselbeck should be the Seahawks GOAT QB.
Mclovin_21,"Everyone who was nominated, and everyone who was subsequently nominated as a result of someone declining/not being able to play in the pro-bowl."
Mclovin_21,"If you move to San Jose you can complete the trifecta football shitfest in the Bay Area and get even more people shanked! And you always get to be 2nd to a hockey team that chokes in heartbreaking fashion in the playoffs every year, so they've got that going for them, too!"
Mclovin_21,I mean he's only had late round picks twice (I guess three times now).
Mclovin_21,Gronk and it's not even close.
Mclovin_21,Well you get some lucky hits on a few All-pros and you can hold up pretty well.
Mclovin_21,"Chiefs, Broncos, Patriots. Chiefs just for SBI rematch, Broncos for revenge for stopping our repeat in 97, Patriots just cause Brady/Rodgers."
Mclovin_21,Well playing in a deep passing scheme with mediocre receivers and no run game will do that to you. Wilson isn't asked to do nearly as much as Luck.
Mclovin_21,"thirteen*

just kidding, but I couldn't resist"
Mclovin_21,But he didn't say the number of attempts.
Mclovin_21,"Probably not his actual price, but it wouldn't be worth it for us unless there was a No1 overall pick with a good qb prospevt and/or like 6 more first round picks."
Mclovin_21,"Nelson and Cobb is similar, just as good if not better than Megatron Tate."
Mclovin_21,TT scoffs at your ridiculous idea.
Mclovin_21,"Past: Brett Favre

Present: Aaron Rodgers"
Mclovin_21,This year we have the best roster in the NFL and we would have gone to the SB last year anyway if some incompetent play calling + crazy miracle shit hadn't happened. Unless it happens twice in a row then we should be in the SB this year.
Mclovin_21,It's absurd in that anyone who would ever buy [this jersey](http://www.cheapjerseysace.us/images/nike_nfl_jerseys/seattle_seahawks/nike_seahawks-176.jpg) is ridiculous.
Mclovin_21,"&gt;complain about eli throwing ints

&gt;coach makes playcalls and scheme that reduces his ints

&gt;complain about said scheme which is reducing his ints

My favorite."
Mclovin_21,"People commonly improperly rate what Luck is actually doing. Stat whores are always crying ""hur dur he has a low completion percentage and a lot of ints"" when he basically is the entire Colts team. Dude has no help, has to put the team on his back practically every game and then people who look at his stats are just like ""meh overrated, he's not that good""."
Mclovin_21,"1. 1985 Bears

2. 2000 Ravens

3. 2002 Bucs

4. 1976 Steelers

5. 1972 ""No Name"" Dolphins

People having the 2013 Seahawks in their top 5 is some serious recency bias. Not that they aren't great, but can you seriously argue they were better than any of these?"
Mclovin_21,"I didn't say he wasn't good, but the other 1st rounders were much better. Benjamin was a terrible route runner and doesn't have the best hands. He wasn't as good as the others."
Mclovin_21,Kramer is such a big snub. Fuck the Lombardi Packer bias.
Mclovin_21,"Well regardless of whether it's meaningful or not the part about the preaseason is just garbage. And I didn't mean elite team, just one of the elite 4 or 5 QBs"
Mclovin_21,"Yeah. Mack is scary good, he'd have my vote. As much as I'd want it to go to Linsley or HaHa because I'm a homer they don't have anything on him as it is (*maybe* Linsley could be in the discussion)."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah this guy is sick. [Crazy highlight reel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCHLLwLY7fs) And this guy has only played for one year! He should only get better with experience. I'm as psyched for this kid as I was for Lacy and HaHa.

If I had a super homer, crazy biased insanely **bold prediction** I'd say that this guy is gonna be the next Charles Woodson."
Mclovin_21,"Right now it's Gronk

JJ Watt maybe if you just counted 3-4 DEs, if you include 4-3 it's a little closer.

Homer but I think Rodgers is up there too."
Mclovin_21,I personally wouldn't.
Mclovin_21,It was a joke.
Mclovin_21,"Favre handed the ball off like once a game several times just to keep his streak alive, it still counts. Rodgers has only missed one start outside of 2013."
Mclovin_21,"**CBs:**

Honorable mention to Eric Berry (hope he gets better) and Jairus Byrd who I didn't know how to place because I feel like I haven't seen him play like he used to be in Buffalo for quite a while."
Mclovin_21,Well tbf if Brees/Favre hadn't been snubbed in 2009 then he'd only have 4 and/or be equal to Favre.
Mclovin_21,I like to think he's one of the players that transcends all hate in the NFL. Who doesn't like DD?
Mclovin_21,It might be too hard to coordinate with subs voting on non superstars.
Mclovin_21,"&gt;""Formatting is your friend""

-Me"
Mclovin_21,"Hey don't lump me in with that guy! 

What do you call an army of cows? *Udder* destruction!"
Mclovin_21,Probably cause PFF is kinda bullshit and they sensationalize certain players' scores. I'm sure there were other factors that went into it (JJ Watt getting double teamed more or something).
Mclovin_21,"Most exciting: Chip Kelly's offense

Most boring: Jets"
Mclovin_21,"I think Sam Shields is the No1 cb in our division right now but maybe I'm just a homer. Rhodes is great but idk if he's better. That said, a ton of the players on our secondaries are pretty similar in skill level. HHCD, Quinn, Fuller, Hayward, Rhodes, Shields, Burnett, Smith (though he's probably the best DB in our division) are all pretty close."
Mclovin_21,Maybe if you've been watching football for less than three years or are experiencing like I said a ton of recency bias.
Mclovin_21,Not gonna lie though I kinda miss Radio City Music Hall
Mclovin_21,"Okay, that's a fair assessment. I don't think they've gotten much worse or anything, but I just think the surgery recovery and loss of Maxwell mean that they haven't gotten any better. That with their a little bit harder schedule makes me think they'll go down a game, but who knows."
Mclovin_21,"I disagree, and I was saying they *could* be not that they are."
Mclovin_21,Rodgers will play forever!
Mclovin_21,Crushing the Bears dreams in Week 17 of 2013 was pretty nice. 4th and 8 was so satisfying...
Mclovin_21,That's a fair assessment. Moss ended up as an exceptional route runner though. And I guess we'll see how OBJ does.
Mclovin_21,I mean the elite 4 all have pretty amazing footwork and pocket presence.
Mclovin_21,AJ Battle Red is a pretty sexy jersey.
Mclovin_21,His team isn't built for the playoffs really. A finesse passing team with no run game or defense is just a recipe for disaster. Ask the 15-1 Packers.
Mclovin_21,"Uh, bottom of page 129, top of 130. McNally says Tom told him in person what he liked, and Jastremsky said Tom knew him too. "
Mclovin_21,I was in full dumpster fire mode until I checked this kid out. He's gonna be a stud. I'm fully confident that he'll be the best player from our draft.
Mclovin_21,"Screen players are easier to read and int because they are a forward pass though, tosses are much harder."
Mclovin_21,"I cam tell you're really buthurrt about this whole thing but cheaters deserved to be punsihed. You guys aren't bring vitcimized over nothing, you broke the rules and have to pay for it.

I love your coach, but you guys are being scrutinized for being repeat offenders, not because you're successful."
Mclovin_21,"That's why a said ""before"". Snap. Chill out."
Mclovin_21,"Oh okay, fair enough."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah you said that and I automatically snapped to Jackson too, then I was like ""Wait, Lewis is a safety, who am I thinking of?"""
Mclovin_21,According to them yeah. And Nick Foles was a top 5 QB after 2013.
Mclovin_21,"Ima go with something uncommon. Joe Namath's knee injury in college. The dude could move, that injury severely limited his game. Most people haven't even seen the best of Joe Namath because that injury took such a big toll. He might have had an ever crazier impact on the NFL."
Mclovin_21,Yeah there's a huge drop off after 4 imo. The rest of the talent is in the AFC.
Mclovin_21,That's incredibly sad...
Mclovin_21,"Well I doubt he gets inducted now. After all, quallsthepatriot12 thinks he's shitty! No way he gets in!"
Mclovin_21,"Eddie Lacy is the best in the NFL at using the spin move, and it's not even close."
Mclovin_21,"Terrible rankings. I can't believe people get paid for this. The only explanation is they put the Seahawks, Pats, Packers, Broncos at the top and then play darts for the rest of the list."
Mclovin_21,Downvote straight up facts however you want. It doesn't make it any less true.
Mclovin_21,"It's kinda funny how the Titans have flip flopped. Before it was like ""Nah Metty is our guy he has a ton of potential!"" Now it's like ""What did he ever do for us, he didn't win any games! Marioto 2 good!"""
Mclovin_21,Good lord we have terrible fundamentals...
Mclovin_21,I guess tell Rodgers that the refs aren't gonna call the offsides penalty so he doesn't throw intentionally throw away the ball into a really risky throw and get intercepted.
Mclovin_21,Honestly it's pretty dumb but every year after the draft and March Madness I watch Eyeshield 21. It's not really very good but it reminds me of football and it's kinda fun. It's at least enough to soothe the withdrawal.
Mclovin_21,"Alright, but I definitely had them in the playoffs before the year started."
Mclovin_21,"I'd shake their hand because I appreciate the work and the tremendous ability these players have and I respect most of them, but I wouldn't care for an autograph or picture of a hated rival unless I particularly likes that specific player for outside reasons."
Mclovin_21,He's worth a 1st rounder in the sense that there's no way we'd trade him unless we wee offered that. Aaron Rodgers is *worth* like 6 1st round draft picks but no one would pay that for him.
Mclovin_21,He actually forced a fumble in the NFCCG. I was legitimately speechless because I've never seen him do anything on his own that was actually good. Too bad he shit the bed for the rest of the game.
Mclovin_21,Except Rice had HoF QBs throwing to him for almost all of his career. By the time Moss got one he was already 30.
Mclovin_21,Nope. Pats fans are just whining like babies and it's funny.
Mclovin_21,What
Mclovin_21,"One DeAndre Levy, please."
Mclovin_21,"Do you think Reggie Wayne just appeared out of thin air the moment Luck got there? He's been there for like 14 years. He was on the 2-14 team. Hilton wasn't that good of a rookie, he dropped shit all the time and was obviously a rookie. Fleener was also a rookie, and also dropped shit all the time. I'm not saying they were bad but no where near the level they are now. The vast majority of the improvement was Luck. And I could also say the same thing about the Seahawks. In their 7-9 season they allowed 20 points a game. In their 11-5 season they allowed 15. That's a huge difference, and probably accounts for one or two more wins alone."
Mclovin_21,"The AFC is extremely weak relative to the NFC.

Last year it was:

Pats

(huge gap)

Rest of the AFC playoff teams

Now the gap is gone because Brady is suspended and they lost Revis and Browner, and they have no real championship caliber teams imo. You couldn't possibly tell me any of them are equal to the Packers, Seahawks, or even the Cowboys. They just aren't on the same level."
Mclovin_21,Well I'd rather have a good leader who actually loves the game of football over someone who's only hyper competitive for no reason. Who says you can't have fun playing the game you love?
Mclovin_21,Np. I assume that as football and the internet become more popular we'll eventually become more educated but still it won't probably be enough. Honestly some owners would have to come out against it for it to have any effect on the league. Who knows if that will ever happen.
Mclovin_21,I mean technically he would only have won the SB because of deflate gate.
Mclovin_21,I don't know how someone is even arguing with you. You provided the exact quote and evidence that proved your point. Some people...
Mclovin_21,"Idk. I'm pretty unbiased about everything but my Packers. However, the evidence is actually pretty damning (much more so than I thought, I honestly expected the deflate thing to be a complete nonstory). I think in this case it's pretty obvious Tom Brady did something fishy and had some involvement in deflation of balls, so it shouldn't be *too* hard to be reasonable. People insisting he's completely innocent are just mega homers."
Mclovin_21,"I don't really think any of our players get a ton of credit other than Rodgers (rightfully) and Matthews, so I guess I'd have to say Matthews. His ability to play inside is way overblown, he might be decent because we don't have anything, but he's only good inside because he's a good football player period, not because he's particularly good at ILB."
Mclovin_21,"Jesus, OBJ after one year? I know it's a guess but still..."
Mclovin_21,He's too big though.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah. If it was best player I'd undoubtedly agree with Faulk or Dickerson. Greatest, on the other hand, is different entirely."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, but then again our #1 was also a 1st round HoFer"
Mclovin_21,JJ Watt and Andrew Luck are the only ones right now I am 100% positive will make the HoF.
Mclovin_21,"CJ2K was crazy in his prime. He's got ""run away from the cops speed""."
Mclovin_21,Except he won't change teams (pls Ted sign him to a contract for life).
Mclovin_21,Too bad Shields is just beast enough to get a hand on it and make the play.
Mclovin_21,"TT retires, Schneider immediately quits the Seahawks and joins us."
Mclovin_21,"The Broncos got demolished by the Colts who in turn got demolished by the Pats. They are equal now, but they weren't last year. I'd be amazed if anyone from the AFC won the SB this year."
Mclovin_21,"Uh, no. Chancellor isn't even the best player at his position. Bethea is the best SS in the league IMO, especially after last year."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah, our defense was pretty shit at that point."
Mclovin_21,Aaron Rodgers disagrees.
Mclovin_21,"No I don't mind you saying that you won it, you guys did it, hard earned fair and square. But bragging like you beat the best defense in the league is like saying you beat the 85 Bears in 86. It doesn't really count. They might still be really good but it's not the same."
Mclovin_21,"My friend said Kaepernick was just as good as Aaron Rodgers (around Kaeps 8th or so start, too).

People saying Le'Veon Bell and OBJ are on the fast track to the HoF (not that they can't be obviously, but seriously it's a million years too early to say that about either of them). Even on that same thing people saying Joe Flacco is *already* a HoFer and the GOAT playoff QB."
Mclovin_21,I mean Smith was still playing 10 years ago so...
Mclovin_21,"I never thought they were better than us, and they weren't. It was bad for me, because I knew we should have been winning."
Mclovin_21,This is why I'll never know why people think Bakhtiari is anything more than average.
Mclovin_21,"Reggie White, LT and Deion. No one could do anything against them and they could each single handedly disrupt the offense. The other trio would still need other weapons and an Oline."
Mclovin_21,So much denial in one thread.
Mclovin_21,I feel like intra-division trades are pretty rare.
Mclovin_21,"Because I'm literally just telling you 40 times. I'm not saying Luck is a better runner than either of those, I'm just saying he had an identically time. He's *literally* and statistically just as mobile."
Mclovin_21,Fair enough I guess. But at that point there's literally nothing Tom Brady could do other than either lose or hope for an int/stop.
Mclovin_21,Fucking toss play. It never works (okay it worked once) and I hate it. 
Mclovin_21,I said he wouldn't have won it anyway. Did you even read what I said?
Mclovin_21,What is it?
Mclovin_21,We might as well redo the entire playoffs!
Mclovin_21,"Tony Romo and Jason Witten, Romo is a great QB and has been almsot all of his career, just bad luck and poor circumstances kept him from getting it. Witten is a HoF TE and like a million years old now, just like it would have been cool for Gonzalez (and Gates, for that matter) it would be cool for him to get one."
Mclovin_21,"Okay, you're right. That is cheating too."
Mclovin_21,"I'd be willing to bet [this catch](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jyv0_hD7cBGCqWj9U5T9wlpvR0M=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443176/cobb.0.gif) is a combination of: 

1. A great throw by a QB trusting his receiver

2. Great coverage that the QB has to throw around

3. The receiver deciding he only needs one hand to catch it or not

4. The receiver actually only using one hand to catch it"
Mclovin_21,"Alright I thought it was gonna be stupid but you win, that's awesome."
Mclovin_21,"LT21 Modern Powder Blue is the GOAT jersey, I think. So sexy."
Mclovin_21,"Except there's a difference between a bad call that has a decent impact on the game and a bad call that ends the game. We had no chance to come back from the illegal facemask. That's different from a non-call earlier in the game. Either way, shit happens. Like I said, that's football. It doesn't make it any less painful though."
Mclovin_21,You kinda just seem like an Alex Smith hater. Smith would have won the SB in 2012.
Mclovin_21,"/thread

There wasn't enough alcohol in the world for the last NFCCG"
Mclovin_21,"Yeah but lets say the tiebreaker goes down to points, the Packers could score less points because of an increased advantage with the 15 yard PATs. Overall the Dome teams get even more of an advantage."
Mclovin_21,Fair enough. But Prime Time is the GOAT cover corner.
Mclovin_21,HaHa is poised for a big leap. I could see him becoming one of the better safeties in the league next year
Mclovin_21,"Rodgers inflated them *before* refs checked them, and sometimes they didn't pass. That's way different from deflating balls *after* the refs give the okay."
Mclovin_21,Same.
Mclovin_21,My personal fave is the Saints players reenacting the Hingle McCringleberry skit where he gets flagged for air humping. The best part is that they actually get flagged for a team celebration and using a towel as a prop.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah that makes sense about Matthews. And Houston hurting himself was pretty dumb I agree.

But Aaron Rodgers? He rarely does the celebration. I can think of only a few times this year he did it. It's mostly a joke at this point. He always thanks his team and while he's confident and definitely a little cocky I don't think he's overly arrogant or an asshole about it. Favre scored and ran down the field screaming, it's really no different. Tom Brady does the same stuff all the time. But I get what you're saying."
Mclovin_21,HHCD was spectacular for a rookie. Shows probowl maybe even all-pro potential in the future.
Mclovin_21,"Using PEDs is a personal violation, that's different from intentionally ruining the integrity of the *entire game* by breaking a rule like that."
Mclovin_21,"Fair enough, I'm just proud of shields for being able to do *something* (which I guess ended up being enough) to put doubt into the catch and the refs. Dude's only 5'11, that's a hard pass to defend for him."
Mclovin_21,Trae Waynes or Brett Hundley. Waynes was the one player I did *not* want Minnesota to get. Shit. Hundley gets to sit and watch the best QB in the NFL play for a few seasons. If he turns out he could end up being traded in a couple seasons (or get paid via free agency ala Flynn) and live a promising career like Hasselbeck did.
Mclovin_21,Caldwell.
Mclovin_21,Vinatieri is the GOAT kicker to me. Maybe it's just recency bias but he sure has the accolades and reputation for it. Punter idk. Maybe Ray Guy.
Mclovin_21,In what world was Rodgers worse than both Romo *and* Roethlisberger?
Mclovin_21,"1. Lynn Dickey

2. Don ""Magic Man"" Majkowski

3. Matt Flynn

We're such a lucky franchise."
Mclovin_21,"Plenty of teams have good mid 1st round or even later round QBs. Dolphins, Patriots, Packers, Vikings, Cowboys, Rams/Eagles (Foles), Saints, Seahawks, Niners, Raiders. I'd say at least half of the good QBs in the league were not 1st or 2nd overall picks."
Mclovin_21,Have you seen the defenses? And Miami's is pretty good.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah Brady has really always been in a ""dink and dunk"" offense, so that makes sense."
Mclovin_21,"They weren't changeing the PSI, so no it's not cheating. If the ref declares the PSI legal, then it is legal. Purposely and intentionally changing the PSI after that is illegal."
Mclovin_21,"The aftermath would have been full of smarmy comments talking about how they just ""knew"" the Jets would win."
Mclovin_21,"He still played all 16 games. Lowest passer rating since 2007? 6 Ints and a force fumble. Rookie CBs aren't supposed to be that good. Kuechly might have been the best rookie at his position but that doesn't beat being the best player at your position.

And I still think those 4 people got snubbed."
Mclovin_21,"""We're gonna do this shit, and we'll do the same shit all game, and it's still gonna kick your ass."""
Mclovin_21,"Fair enough, but he still caused them to be inflated less than they should have been."
Mclovin_21,At the time I felt like the 2010 Packers were pretty underdoggy till the playoffs rolled around. I didn't expect them to be in the predictions honestly.
Mclovin_21,"What if I told you that all Broncos can become Colts again? An ESPN 30 for 30 Special, ""How Peyton Manning's Contract ran out at 40 and somehow he ended up signing with the Colts again and winning a SB"""
Mclovin_21,Ours might not be *great* but its not like we chose bad players. Just not particular needs. Also Rollins is a great pick nomatter what.
Mclovin_21,"That was Burnett, and he didn't want him to McCree it. 99.9% of the time that's the best call right there."
Mclovin_21,"Can confirm, that's the GOAT football commercial. Though Namath's Nylon stocking commercial comes close."
Mclovin_21,Yeah the [first int](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCHLLwLY7fs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;) from that video was the one that sold me on him. That's some tight shit.
Mclovin_21,Not from Tom.
Mclovin_21,I'm sure he'd do better than 1 TD 4 ints. Wilson threw 1 TD before the SB the year they won. Plenty of other QBs could do that.
Mclovin_21,What about ETIII who led the No1 defense by far?
Mclovin_21,"28 is bad but winnable, 51, is ridiculous."
Mclovin_21,"It would be interesting to expand to 8 teams per conference like the NBA, but not sure how that would work with byes. Also the coin toss in OT is pretty bullshit but I don't love the CFB system because sudden death seems like a more fitting option for the pros. I guess I can't have both."
Mclovin_21,How can you not love Driver's adorable smile. Such a sexy grin.
Mclovin_21,"Well thanks. But There's no way Jordy Nelson isn't top 10. He's closer to top 5. He led the NFL in yardage for like 8 weeks last year and finished top 3 in yardage and in TDs. Cobb was also excellent and if not top 15 at least top 20. He's on top 100 players as the 17th, which is low imo. To suggest Lacy isn't that good is just ridiculous. There are barely 15 other teams in the league that use only one back instead of a committee. When Rodgers was out Lacy carried our team in 2013, and he's *easily* top 10. The most ludicrous thing though, is insisting that Rodgers is only top 5. At the ***very worst*** he's top 2. But he's not. He's the best QB in the league right now and everything supports that. 

Our secondary is pretty good. Burnett just came off a top 5 SS year, HaHa played pretty well for a rookie and Shields is a fantastic player. Casey Haywards is also pretty darn good, his rookie year he allowed the lowest passer rating of any corner since 2007. It makes sense that he could be a good outside corner, especially considering he played well last year when he had to be cause of injuries.

I don't think I'm overly confident, and I *would* bet money if I could. But I'm a broke college student and I can't afford that. So I don't know what to say."
Mclovin_21,I'd bet anything that barring injury Luck will get in to the Hall of Fame.

"
Mclovin_21,"Oh, okay. I thought I was crazy haha."
Mclovin_21,I assumed that meant someone didn't play the entire season.
Mclovin_21,"That's fair, but still Brady had 5 years to work out those kinks."
Mclovin_21,Well I disagree.
Mclovin_21,"No one is even at 3 and A-rod is closing in on 4, jesus."
Mclovin_21,And how often will a RB run for 2k yards?
Mclovin_21,"Belichick (good lord people ITT have no clue how to spell his name), Carroll, McCarthy, Harbaugh, Sean Payton, with Arians, Pagano and Tomlin all on the fringe.

From an outside perspective I think Vic Fangio is the best coordinator by far, offensive or defensive. How this guy doesn't have a HC job I have no fucking clue. Took a bunch of hidden stars and made them a fantastic top 2 defense, then everyone was dead and injured and he took a bunch of nobodies and still had them in the top 10."
Mclovin_21,"They allowed 5 less points per game, went from top 10 to top 3. It's not bullshit it's just facts. Sorry I know more about your team than you do."
Mclovin_21,"Yeah. Thought sometimes Stafford just goes ""fuck it"" and throws it deep and CJ makes some crazy ass play. Not sure how often Rodgers would do that. Maybe if they had the chemistry I guess."
Mclovin_21,We have a really good run game and Oline though.
Mclovin_21,"Why are the Jets so inept? Every offseason they bring in a vet and let him ""fight"" for the job, then they are like ""lolno go fuck yourself, we're killing the rest of your career"" and then they watch the Geno shitshow and wonder why they are doing awful."
Mclovin_21,"I think if he went down with a career ending injury *right this second* he wouldn't be a lock, and it would at the very least take a long time for him to get in."
Mclovin_21,"I hope so. My guess is that he or Hayward (both I think are gonna be studs) will be the #2 corner, and we'll end up playing more cover 3 so our crazy safety depth will get some playing time."
Mclovin_21,"Ridiculous hype surrounding a player/play/team after they do something once and recency bias. OBJ is good, but not he's not on the fast track for the Hall of Fame, you can't say that about a rookie. No, the 2013 Seahawks D was not the GOAT defense. And just because a player is well known, that doesn't make him the best at his position."
Mclovin_21,Packers over Colts (hopefully)
Mclovin_21,For real. Crazy. [How I imagine that worked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep-qQWN4Lp0)
Mclovin_21,"Joe Namath was the great of all greats. He might not have been *that* good, but he was certainly great."
Mclovin_21,"Lets say it was 50 degrees in each of those mentioned places

0-50-50-50-50 = -200

It was a joke."
Mclovin_21,I'd say Moon but I'm biased so who knows.
Mclovin_21,I bet you're fun at parties.
Mclovin_21,"Rodgers never cheated, he just preferred ball inflated on the harder side. He would still let the refs check them, if they were ever too inflated then they wouldn't check them off. He never inflated balls *after* the refs checked them, which is what Brady is being accused of."
Mclovin_21,Top safety.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah Idk. My only assumption would be that the logo gauge said the Colts balls were over-inflated which made them not reasonable, so even still the Pats balls were under-inflated. I'm not sure how much it matters *how much* they were under-inflated, just that they were deflated *at all* after they had already been checked off. But like I said that's just what I would assume."
Mclovin_21,NFCN!
Mclovin_21,"His highlights are unreal for someone who had never even played college ball. If he played another season there's no doubt in my mind he'd be a first round pick (obviously assuming he still played and progressed as well). His ball skills, eagerness to make the big hit and a penchant for always being around the ball make me think he could be special."
Mclovin_21,"The great part about that play is not only that a QB scored a receiving TD, but it was a legitimate TD he had to beat defenders to make. That's a bucket list play."
Mclovin_21,Yeah I agree. By the time they hobbled into the playoffs they were basically a practice squad offense.
Mclovin_21,"Except I'm not wrongly using it, and you're misrepresenting my argument. Also it's ""I couldn't care less"".

I disagree that the NFL system is purely a bartering system. In the NFL, draft picks work like currency. Sure, there are player for player trades which work exactly like you said, but that's not always the case. Trading draft picks for players pretty much works how I described. Coincidence of wants doesn't necessarily apply when you're trading draft picks for what you're trying to get."
Mclovin_21,I doubt AJ Green is *so* much better than Jordy that it would make that much of a difference.
Mclovin_21,"Yeah but routinely made throws that Rodgers *couldn't*? That's crazy. Rodgers might not attempt some throws, but that's ridiculous."
Mclovin_21,Who's the SS though? jw.
Mclovin_21,I am the owner.
Mclovin_21,"I'd put Smith at #1 but that's just me. Tannehill is good, he's pretty good looking. Cam maybe at third, and I'd then swap Romo and Brady, it's pretty hard to get past Brady's weird fashion sense. I mean look at [this monstrosity](http://prod.static.patriots.clubs.nfl.com/assets/images/2014/lifestyle/20141022_tombradyfashion1.jpg)"
Mclovin_21,Anyone who says he's not top 10 is insane or doesn't know shit about football.
Mclovin_21,"Sometimes he just has off games. I don't remember any drops other than the Bills game, where everyone had damned stone hands. Other than that he has pretty spectacular hands"
Mclovin_21,Well when you have easier competition from everyone else every year that happens.
Mclovin_21,"So you're comparing one year to several years? When he came in, you guys won 11 games. When he wasn't there you won 7. That's how it adds up. You can't compare a team more than two years away. But whatever, I'd rather not spend my time arguing with a 13 yo bandwagon fan."
Mclovin_21,Well let's say that they are blitzing a guy (which I know isn't necessarily true just because he's being pressured) that means there's one guy who would normally be in coverage who now isn't. Makes it easier to find someone open. In 2011 Aaron Rodgers had like a 145 passer rating when being blitzed or something crazy like that.
Mclovin_21,Rodgers? You're crazy.
Mclovin_21,"Except the Packers lost 2 of their last 4 games, and 3 of their last 6."
Mclovin_21,"That's the worst argument that people bring up, ""if they had done this and this he wouldn't have *needed* to do _____"" Well they didnt, and so his fumbling the ball cost them the game. It's the same thing as the fail mary apologizers. They did enough to win the game, whatever else they did was moot. He should have slid immediately, they win."
Mclovin_21,"Not in fucking Madden, he got beat 1 on 1 by Jordy fucking Nelson for the game winner D:"
Mclovin_21,"[Cardinals knocking the Vikings out of the playoffs](http://www.nfl.com/videos/arizona-cardinals/09000d5d82a24851/Famous-announcing-Cardinals-knock-Vikings-out-of-playoffs). Receiver gets knocked out, at the time if you were pushed out of bound by a defender it still counted as a TD."
Mclovin_21,I think Thomas is greater overall than him but his ability *right now* is slightly overrated. I don't know enough about Jason Peters to say anythign about that.
Mclovin_21,I mean AJ Hawks wasn't really *good* at it but he was as textbook as textbook gets. The truly averagest player I've ever seen.
Mclovin_21,Can I have Rodgers for both?
Mclovin_21,JJ Watt. Besides him it's easily Aaron Rodgers.
Mclovin_21,"So is Ryan Fitzpatrick better than Russell Wilson because he had a better passer rating this year? Is Tony Romo better than Tom Brady because he has a better career passer rating? You're either stupid or a troll (hopefully just a troll, It'd be sad if someone was too stupid to get such a simple concept)."
Mclovin_21,I don't know how it's so underrated. Under 14 PPG and less than 240 YPG. That's some crazy shit.
Mclovin_21,And I'm saying they are the best WR duo in the league.
Mclovin_21,Not make tickets cost your left and right nut.
Mclovin_21,"Because we have the most titles of any other franchise. The SB isn't everything, though it is big. But we have 13 championships and it's not even particularly close. *That's* why GB is titletown. "
Mclovin_21,"Everyone seems to be in love with DVOA, but I'm not too into it. I don't know what the point you're trying to make with the twitter link is, though. I don't remember those plays in question but Brady really isn't the best deep ball thrower, so it's a valid criticism."
Mclovin_21,"They're pretty self-righteous to be honest. Can't say anything negative without being downvoted to hell or people saying ""Go root for another team if you're gonna be pessimistic"", even if you what you said wasn't anything bad. And also I'm one of the big TT supporters but still some people are *way* too much into the koolaid."
Mclovin_21,"There was one play on a Tom Brady to Gronk TD where a ton of shit happened, and they had to figure out if Gronk stepped out of bounds, and if it was legal for the DB to push Gronk or if it was a foul. Tom Brady crossed the outside of the pocket by like 2 inches so it was actually legal for the DB to push Gronk and some other crazy stuff. I can't find the video but that's the craziest thing I remember."
Mclovin_21,"If you throw the ball 10 times a game, and one of your receivers gets 30% of your targets, he'll get around 3 targets that game. If you throw it 30 times a game and he gets 30% of your targets, he gets close to 9 targets a game. The person with 3 targets per game will *probably* end up with lower stats as a result, because their QB doesn't throw the ball nearly as much. Clear?"
SpygateHernandez,Oh my God... I've never been so hard... think I'm going to pass out due to all the blood going from my brain to my erection *hnnnnnnnnnnngnggghhh*
SpygateHernandez,"He said elsewhere (and maybe you didn't see this) that similarly his white friends were uncomfortable with him calling himself a ""wetback"" (I guess he's Mexican) so my understanding was that this was what he is alluding to. "
SpygateHernandez,I feel like Chip Kelly is just trying to confuse everybody at this point. 
SpygateHernandez,I love a food fight. 
SpygateHernandez,"He has a likable personality (at least to me) and he makes noise, which is basically all you need to do to stay on ESPN. Minus the likable part. "
SpygateHernandez,"We all know cloning technology isn't even near that stage yet. 

I have researched this specifically because I had this concern. "
SpygateHernandez,"I've seen the film man. I didn't watch him play every Sunday because I was busy not being born for another 25 years, but he wasn't airing it out like Joe Namath or Terry Bradshaw. "
SpygateHernandez,"I like to stir the pot in general. My motives aside, Brady *is* a liar. "
SpygateHernandez,It just meant they were helping him by illegally deflating footballs. 
SpygateHernandez,"The AFC West right now is pretty damned good. You've got one of the all time greats in Peyton, an excellent (and underappreciated) passer in Rivers, an excellent game manager in Alex Smith, and a promising up-and-comer in Carr. "
SpygateHernandez,I like to lay my cards right on the table.
SpygateHernandez,"Contrary to what Marx thought, backup quarterbacks are the opium of the masses. "
SpygateHernandez,Keep dreaming. 
SpygateHernandez,"Smith is definitely way better than Orton. More handsome, for starters. "
SpygateHernandez,"Every time I make a lolBrowns joke some Browns fan will simply repeat what I said and replace ""Browns"" with ""Jets."" It is as lame as Cleveland's quarterback play. Learn how to do a proper comeback, Browns fans. "
SpygateHernandez,"No, Browns. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah I seriously doubt it. 

In fact, it's remarkable that the Steelers kept it as close as they did against the Packers, who had a truly excellent pass defense and forced three turnovers. 

That Lovie Smith Tampa-2 with Urlacher, Briggs, Peppers, and Tillman was pretty fucking bad-ass though. Zone coverage FTW."
SpygateHernandez,Ted Thompson has lost it. 
SpygateHernandez,"The notion that Aaron Rodgers has consistently played with bad defenses is a myth. The only ""bad"" defense he played with was 2012 (that's right, 2011 was a *damned* fine defense) and all of his other defenses have been around the top 10 in terms of defensive passer rating and excellent in points allowed per drive as well. 

Teams rack up a lot of empty yards against the Packers because they always play from behind. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah, maybe you'll get lucky and he'll punch a nun in the face or something. "
SpygateHernandez,The Browns are actually having a pretty good draft this year. Madness. 
SpygateHernandez,I choose to interpret it the opposite way. 
SpygateHernandez,"Marino in particular had a shit ton of help on defense. He was drafted onto the defending AFC champs who had gotten to the SB on the strength of their rushing attack and defense. And in his last year he had the top ranked pass defense by passer rating. Peyton and Brady have played with roughly comparable pass defenses since 2004 (there was an article about it by /u/LuckyNickels in the Pats sub a while back). Rodgers has consistently played with very good pass defenses. 

Brady actually won a playoff game with a bottom 5 pass defense (2005) but in fairness they were probably cheating somehow. "
SpygateHernandez,"Wait, wouldn't that constitute an *attempt*  but not a *completion*?"
SpygateHernandez,"That entrepreneur seemed like a dumbass in multiple ways, but props for beating the astronaut married to the congresswoman who was shot by that guy a few years back (remember that?) "
SpygateHernandez,With pleasure!
SpygateHernandez,"I'll grant you that Nets-Knicks is somewhat forced, but Yankees-Mets is totally fucking legit. Fuck the Yankees. "
SpygateHernandez,Some users will shit on the Cleveland Browns basically out of nowhere in totally unrelated topics and it's always funny. Ed Reed joining in on the fun was just the creme de la creme. 
SpygateHernandez,I just want you to admit that Ben Roethilsberger is fat. 
SpygateHernandez,They said Gallileo was crazy too. 
SpygateHernandez,"We live in a quarterback-rich age, and yet it still feels like there's so few people who can do it with any degree of competence at the NFL level. 

Probably because I like the Jets. "
SpygateHernandez,"A quarterback, a quarterback, my kingdom for a quarterback! 

EDIT: Alright you wiseguys, the minimum level of quarterback I would trade Sheldon Richardson or Revis for would be... Andy Dalton. I know, gross, but the position is simply much more important than any single defensive position. Besides, we now have depth! Glorious, glorious depth!"
SpygateHernandez,Not with that attitude it can't. 
SpygateHernandez,"I was giving props to OP because his username took such a shocking turn. ""Horton Hears"" immediately made me think of Dr. Suess and innocent children's stories, but it took a sharp left turn when I got to the word ""genocide."" It was masterfully done. "
SpygateHernandez,It has nothing to do with anything *they* have tried to impart on me. It has to do with deontological standards of conduct that everyone should adhere to. 
SpygateHernandez,Yes you do liar. 
SpygateHernandez,"At first I read that as ""Cannabis"" so I'm going to say cannabis. We might be able to get Marino to become a Jets fan. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah it was frustrating as hell. 
SpygateHernandez,"The past does not necessarily repeat itself, contrary to what George Santayana would have you believe. "
SpygateHernandez,No he lied and is therefore a liar. 
SpygateHernandez,Can you blame us? 
SpygateHernandez,The Browns. All they do is Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,You miss the 90s too?
SpygateHernandez,That's racist man. 
SpygateHernandez,"It pains me but you are correct. Those San Diego teams were loaded as hell. 

Of course, Marlon McCree. "
SpygateHernandez,And a fine job you're doing! 
SpygateHernandez,"Tom Brady award for making other people jealous and bitter. 

First recipient, me. "
SpygateHernandez,"The way you put it you'd think the NFL season only consisted of games in January. 

EDIT: Tarkenton was faster than Bradshaw too!"
SpygateHernandez,Queens motherfucker. I actually don't like Bruce Springsteen.
SpygateHernandez,"Fucking Stalinism. 

I bet the NFL shop is run by the mods of /r/nfl. "
SpygateHernandez,Fucking Goodell
SpygateHernandez,This is Tom Brady's scouting report and also why did you have to bring this up?
SpygateHernandez,"Just a little too convenient, no?"
SpygateHernandez,No it was the Packers. 
SpygateHernandez,Hands down Rand University
SpygateHernandez,In some ways he was the Eli Manning of his era ;)
SpygateHernandez,Yeah but y'all got 'em back with that nice little sting operation Grigson pulled off. 
SpygateHernandez,Oh
SpygateHernandez,OP was asking for it. 
SpygateHernandez,1985 Chicago Bears. 
SpygateHernandez,This will not happen. This *cannot* happen. The universe will not allow this to happen. 
SpygateHernandez,"And they intercepted more passes than they allowed touchdowns. Teams were always playing catchup because they were always behind, and some of the time it worked.

Quantity stats are empty my friend. You have to look at *quality* stats to really get an idea of where a defense stands. "
SpygateHernandez,"My God, this is brilliant!

And this author, Shaughnessy, did a fantastic job! I'm going to have to start reading his stuff more often if it's all this level of quality. "
SpygateHernandez,This is the perfect week for it. 
SpygateHernandez,"I don't really know the specifics of how much Garrett had to do with the current roster, but the reality is that if you coach with one team for a fairly long time you'll eventually end up with a talented roster. See Jeff Fisher and the late 90s/early 2000s Titans. 

I'm not saying that was definitely the case with Garrett, but I am saying you can't reason that because the team is good and talented now that Garrett therefore automatically deserves credit. 

I was always of the impression that Jones kept Garrett around because Garrett has a weak personality and would do what Jerry told him to do. He is still influenced by the Jimmy Johnson era. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Considering there are zero texts, calls or emails between the two

Didn't Brady call him for three days in a row (after not calling him for six months prior) after the Deflategate broke?
"
SpygateHernandez,You can do your best without sounding like an egotistical asshole. 
SpygateHernandez,"Favre tried to force things, Rodgers takes what the defense gives him. "
SpygateHernandez,"1) Namath. 

2) Ken O'Brien

3) Vinny Testaverde"
SpygateHernandez,It is a well-stirred pot.
SpygateHernandez,"Woah, you crossed multiple lines right there. Fucking mad respect. I love Eagles fans!"
SpygateHernandez,"Obviously you don't know the effect that ice can have on things that are too hot. 

It's effect is 'nice.' 

&gt;I don't even know what a snip is

You're goddamned right you will!"
SpygateHernandez,"Whenever people have to resort to simply saying ""OK"" (especially in gif form) it means they ran out of arguments and are pathetically resorting to trying to appear above the dispute. "
SpygateHernandez,"It helps them ingratiate themselves to their new quarterbacks, partially by making their positive comments about them seem sincere (because only a sincere person, presumably, would backhand their previous quarterback.) 

Which isn't to say that their statements are not honest. "
SpygateHernandez,"In other words, he's guilty. Got it. "
SpygateHernandez,Chad Pennington (when you consider his career as a whole)
SpygateHernandez,"Nice try, but my fat ugly mama had to have her legs amputated because she's morbidly obese, so *there*!"
SpygateHernandez,Your anger feels me with nothing but unbridled joy. 
SpygateHernandez,Didn't they play the easiest schedule in NFL history that year?
SpygateHernandez,;)
SpygateHernandez,And you and I both know that that pre-2010 history involves a shit ton of the Browns sucking. 
SpygateHernandez,It's overwhelmingly Browns fans. 
SpygateHernandez,TBH I don't think he has another 2012-level campaign in him. But his return will certainly help that offense out. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; The Pats scandal sucks but he didn't even give out the punishment

I didn't expect you to be so naive. "
SpygateHernandez,Bart Starr was a game manager too. Old-timers will tell you that he never threw a pass more than 20 yards in the air. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; clutch.

He had one GWD/4QCB according to PFR. Bridgewater had 3. 

Granted, that alone does not mean either will be better or worse, and I don't know how many opportunities each had, but just food for thought. "
SpygateHernandez,You're one of the good ones. 
SpygateHernandez,"I'm from Queens and you will get no argument from me that we are a bunch of assholes. But I would rather live amongst the self-important assholes of New York with its cultural vibrancy and endless supply of adventure and excitement than waste what precious little time I have on this earth in the rust-belt boredom of Cleveland. 

Pittsburgh, on the other hand? That's a pretty cool city. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah! It reminded me of *Let it Bleed*. What a great album. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; And it was the Friday before the game.

Oh, well *that* changes everything. The principle remains true and untouched. 

&gt;Also in your source is the fact that the league denied any sort of wrongdoing by Patriots staff and that no taping of the Rams walk through occurred.

The Patriots managed to have perfect checks for a series of new plays *and* Roger Goodell had the evidence destroyed. But I guess we'll never know. Just like we'll never know who killed Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman. "
SpygateHernandez,"The problem is the Browns and their amazing ability to find new and interesting ways to be a laughingstock year after year. It's actually impressive in a twisted way. 

Nobody from Cleveland ever fucked my girl, but 53 men have managed to fuck the entire city of Cleveland every Sunday for 16 years, and it wasn't consensual. BTW you and I both know LeBron is going to choke when it matters. "
SpygateHernandez,Not the Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,"People act like those dues don't pay for any benefits. Collective bargaining costs money folks, and the sad reality is that people will gladly accept its benefits without paying for the costs associated with obtaining those benefits. ""Free riders,"" as they are known in the world of economics. "
SpygateHernandez,"In your heart you know that I am correct despite my bizarre and baseless reasoning. 

It's all about the ""eye test."" "
SpygateHernandez,Exist. 
SpygateHernandez,Tony Romo is one of the best comeback quarterbacks of all time. 
SpygateHernandez,"(fuck it, I can't resist)

WE (THEY) TAKE THE BALL FROM GOAL TO GOAL"
SpygateHernandez,"Like I said, Geno sucks, but even *he* is better than Weeden. Weeden never posted a passer rating as a starter as high as what Geno did last year, and that is despite the fact Geno Smith sucks. He's terrible, he's just not ""Browns quarterback terrible,"" as they say. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah but he didn't turn over his phone. 
SpygateHernandez,"Well then Belichick did a hell of a job getting the Patriots checks for plays that the Rams had never run before. Bravo. 

"
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah but I didn't say ""it will continue to be talented forever and ever after a while."" Like Fisher, if you coach for a long time there will be highs and lows (assuming you don't luck into a great franchise quarterback at a young age a la Belichick who can cover up a lot of warts on your roster.) ""It will happen"" doesn't mean ""it will continue forever."" 

I will defer to you on Garrett's authority over his roster, but he still seems like a weak man who will ultimately do what Jerry (or Stephen, as the case may be) tells him. "
SpygateHernandez,It airs at 7:30 where I live (NY) so there's a difference of two hours in real time. 
SpygateHernandez,"Oh God

We've made a huge mistake"
SpygateHernandez,"I'm not uninformed, the players Thompson drafted are just nobodies. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah I should read it later. Work in the morning. Tag me again if necessary. 
SpygateHernandez,Who knows if Bowman will be the same. 
SpygateHernandez,"Jets-Giants, which is merely an extension in the Yankees-Mets, Rangers-Islanders, Nets-Knicks rivalry. "
SpygateHernandez,"LeBron is a frontrunner. There's nothing wrong with that, but he ain't Jordan. "
SpygateHernandez,"I will read this later, but props for paying so much attention to the substance of the report and its details. You clearly do not have a future at ESPN. "
SpygateHernandez,ITT: Orange and Brown downvote brigade tying themselves in knots to convince themselves that downvoting my comments will make their quarterback situation better. 
SpygateHernandez,"People around here are really talking up Minnesota quite a lot. I think that they are clearly an improving team, but I need to see them prove it. "
SpygateHernandez,Consult username.
SpygateHernandez,"The 2009 NFC Championship game. Not because of one dramatically called bad play like the Fail Mary game, but because there were a bunch of crappy calls and non-calls that tipped the game in the Saints favor. 

Most people tend to focus on the illegal hits. There were no doubt at least *some* hits that the Saints got away with illegally, but others are debatable and bound to be colored by the bias of the observer. Personally I believe there were a large number of hits that should have been called against Favre. 

But beyond that, I remember watching that final drive by the Saints after the ball went into overtime. It was just horrible. The Saints kept getting call after call in their favor. Catches that hit the ground, phantom pass interference where linebackers weren't even touching receivers, etc. And it ended in a field goal. That must have been incredibly frustrating for Vikings fans to watch. 

I personally believe that the Saints were the better team overall that year (Brees should have been the league MVP and their defense was also excellent, third best against the pass in terms of DPR if I remember correctly) but the Vikings truly were the better team on the field that day. "
SpygateHernandez,"Hear hear, Colts bro! This dude just doesn't get it: if you can't beat 'em, accuse 'em of cheating like both our teams have done. It's the American way!"
SpygateHernandez,Yeah I was the astronaut. 
SpygateHernandez,"That's it, the Vikings are my NFC team now. "
SpygateHernandez,"I feel like every non-Pats AFC fanbase can appreciate it, and in some way claim it as their own. "
SpygateHernandez,"Admit it OP, you just made this thread so that you could show off your ""Floundering Fish"" headline, didn't you?"
SpygateHernandez,Gotta be Graham. He'll be the #1 option with an established quarterback. 
SpygateHernandez,Close enough. But this guy was Favre before there was Favre. 
SpygateHernandez,"If I was alone in a room with Warren Sapp, Bill Romanowski, and Joseph Stalin and had a gun with two bullets, I would shoot Tom Brady twice. "
SpygateHernandez,Definitely not the viewers. 
SpygateHernandez,He doesn't have the greatest arm but he's plenty athletic. The problem is that he makes terrible decisions and bails out of the pocket at the slightest whiff of pressure. 
SpygateHernandez,"The fact that he talked about it in the context of Brady passing the football is pretty damning. I really don't see how you can get around that one, and the fact that that text was sent earlier doesn't really matter. It established that he talked about deflation (an unusual term to use) in the context of deflating Brady's footballs. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yes, and we cannot conclude from that fact that the Browns *do not* suck. 

Why is it that sports fans don't seem to realize this rather simple logical point?"
SpygateHernandez,"I think he did have a very promising rookie campaign but we simply need to see him play more games before we go saying that he's going to be a franchise quarterback. It's entirely possible that he will, but there just isn't enough information at this point."
SpygateHernandez,"Hey, I got you to admit that some form of spying took place. I'm pretty sure you just declared me winner by virtue of tying yourself into that little knot. The hissy fit just sealed the deal. 

Now wipe away your angry tears and get on with your life. "
SpygateHernandez,"Symbolic logic is actually very different from conversational ""logic."" It theoretically applies to actual, English statements but really it's pretty much a self-contained system. 

If you ever take the LSAT you will quickly discover that symbolic logic is a very different animal from the kind of ""logic"" that applies to reading comprehension. "
SpygateHernandez,"Well he actually passed the ball more efficiently as a rookie than Luck did, but besides that I really don't see what bearing the fact that he didn't have the best rookie season ever has on this discussion. Having a passer rating like that as a rookie -- especially given that he improved steadily throughout the year -- is definitely reason for optimism and it suggests that he's going to have a promising future. "
SpygateHernandez,Just don't have Peyton try to act as his lawyer. He'll be great during the middle of the trial but piss down his leg in closing arguments. 
SpygateHernandez,"I strongly disagree. Scheme does not significantly influence YPA. And even teams with superb running games don't see many 8-man fronts (there was an article on this from like 2012 that I'll dig around for, but even Adrian Peterson only faced 8-man fronts about 1/3 of the time.) "
SpygateHernandez,There aren't any songs about a torn ACL?
SpygateHernandez,Nah. 
SpygateHernandez,"Boy, I sure hope they remember to feature J.J. Watt regularly. "
SpygateHernandez,Your feelings are incorrect. 
SpygateHernandez,"I'd say they're the favorites pending the Russell Wilson situation, which I fully expect to be amicably resolved. "
SpygateHernandez,Weakness: It isn't 2010 anymore. 
SpygateHernandez,"In my view they're more of the ""hope he can turn it around"" (both in terms of substance abuse and being an arrogant little douche) vein than ""gushfests"" (which coincidentally could be the name of a porno movie.) "
SpygateHernandez,"No, it's ""Bridgette Moynihan""

EDIT: Wait a second, I forgot, it's actually ""Tuck""!"
SpygateHernandez,"You mean Geno ""Only perfect passer rating of 2014"" Smith?"
SpygateHernandez,Yes.
SpygateHernandez,Mad respect to both of y'all. I need to start eating more vegetables and maybe I can take shits that often. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; You also don't know much of anything about me, you have no idea if I'm innocent or naive just because I'm from Minnesota.

Sure I do. All regional stereotypes are always true. "
SpygateHernandez,It would be significant to hear them say that directly. 
SpygateHernandez,And I still haven't heard of any of them...
SpygateHernandez,Is there anything beer can't do?
SpygateHernandez,"I could see any of Oakland, Washington, Chicago, or Jacksonville ending up with the pick. 

I would love to say the Browns but that honestly seems unlikely (although in fairness, Browns.) "
SpygateHernandez,1/8 is pretty significant. I guess the best way to test it would be to look at their DPR with and without Browns games. I'm not claiming it was everything but it would have a statistical influence.  
SpygateHernandez,Reality is so disappointing. 
SpygateHernandez,It's what false hope feels like. I have experienced it many times before. 
SpygateHernandez,"I remember a few weeks ago there was a thread which asked what teams were going to be major contenders coming up and the top response said ""Vikings: I don't think people realize how close they are."" 

While I think it's totally plausible that they'll contend, I think people are getting ahead of themselves at this point. One step at a time. "
SpygateHernandez,"Either that or you just have a really good quarterback. 

Rodgers make up for a multitude of Derrek Sherrods. "
SpygateHernandez,ITT: Browns fans talking shit and getting cocky. This is exactly what y'all said after Manziel was drafted. 
SpygateHernandez,"Sorry, I was 5 years old in 1994. Too busy believing that Santa was real to pay much attention to football."
SpygateHernandez,"Given everything else that has happened to the 49ers this season I assumed he had done so already. 

Harbaugh giveth, York taketh away. "
SpygateHernandez,You wish.
SpygateHernandez,Burfict and Suggs are both most definitely dirty too. 
SpygateHernandez,Nah he was fucked from the beginning. If he went to Green Bay he'd probably have become a meth addict. 
SpygateHernandez,All you need to know about the New England Patriots can be summed up in a single made up word: Spyflation. 
SpygateHernandez,One issue we can agree on. 
SpygateHernandez,The Patriots :/
SpygateHernandez,"I don't like Springsteen, although ""Born to Run"" and ""Dancing in the Dark"" are damned fine tunes"
SpygateHernandez,I guess there would be no need to file chargers because as we all know he can't throw. 
SpygateHernandez,Geno Smith sucks a bag of dicks but he would start for the Browns and give them their best quarterback play in a looooong time. 
SpygateHernandez,I'm pretty sure a highschool team could beat the Browns. They'd certainly have a better quarterback situation. 
SpygateHernandez,stop with the Minnesota modesty. Clemmings was a goddamned steal and you know it. 
SpygateHernandez,"Well, that would take a while. For now I'm content to just post embarrassing Browns-related content. "
SpygateHernandez,That means I'm doing something right ;D
SpygateHernandez,It's also full of vitamins and minerals! 
SpygateHernandez,"With powers of deduction like that, you could easily be an assistant to Ted Wells. "
SpygateHernandez,He knows his limits. 
SpygateHernandez,They too shall soon know what it feels like to have shit quarterback play. 
SpygateHernandez,Can you really be *proud* of a Browns flair?
SpygateHernandez,Than the Browns? Yes. That's not because the Jets have a great track record. It's because the Browns have a HORRIBLE track record. 
SpygateHernandez,"I can't seem to find streaming video of the 2002 AFC Wildcard Playoff game where the 9-7 Jets blew Peyton out of the water. This is a deerly cherished childhood memory of mine, so if anyone has the full game, I'd really appreciate it. Maybe even give you a hand-job if its in good quality. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt;I'll take an everything bagel topped with smoked salmon and cream cheese over a doughnut any time.

Fucking take it back now. "
SpygateHernandez,My rapier wit and penchant for self-deprecation are impossible to resist. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt;Or maybe I'm not suffering from manic depression and extreme rage

Wow, you're really into this whole ""making shit up"" thing aren't you? 

&gt; Supporting a team is about supporting them through the highs and lows, so I guess I just don't get what it's like to be a fan of your nature.

I never said I don't support the Jets, the reality is that we are just jaded and cynical about our team. We are realistic fans and we are not naieve stoolies like Pats fans are. Brady lied, get over it. "
SpygateHernandez,What about Matthews?
SpygateHernandez,That's damned good. Rate+ really shows you what a big difference that passing the ball above average makes. 
SpygateHernandez,Wasn't that to an extent explicable by the Ideal Gas Law? 
SpygateHernandez,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHA
SpygateHernandez,"Rodgers likewise had the best line he's ever had to work with, probably a top-5 unit. Romo simply deserved at least significant consideration for the award because he passed the ball *better* than Rodgers in every measurable category. "
SpygateHernandez,"Given the fact that McNally also sent a message saying ""the only thing deflating this Sunday is his passing rating (sic)"" I would say the latter. 

Also, McNally seems fat and stupid based on his grammar in text messages. "
SpygateHernandez,"They don't have any superstars at this point but Smith would be a superstar on a more notable team. He's arguably the best safety in the league and pretty much in a dead heat with Weddle in my view. 

""Superstars"" may have been a bad term, what they really have is a lot of up and commers who are going to have to get paid eventually and that will create problems. It's a good problem to have I suppose but a problem you have to circumvent by starting the Ryan Clarks of the world across from your Troy Polamalus. "
SpygateHernandez,It's more probable than not that /r/nfl has a pro-Patriots bias. 
SpygateHernandez,RIP my link karma. 
SpygateHernandez,"Belichick and Brady must have run over somebody's dog at ESPN or something because they fucking have it out for the Pats right now and it is deeeeeeeeelicious. 

Just listen to the guest on the latest episode (5/12/15) of the football today podcast. They have this guy on supposedly to talk about Deflategate punishment, they play a clip of Brady laughing off the initial report on Boston sports radio, and then this dude instead of talking about the punishment just goes on an angry, venomous tirade about how Brady comes off as smug and arrogant in the interview. 

It's wonderful. It's like crack. I just can't get enough!  "
SpygateHernandez,"It wasn't even a bad pass, Butler just made a hell of a play. And the Seahawks wouldn't have even been in position to have one pass determine the ultimate fate of the season if Wilson's otherwise fantastic performance hand't put them in position to win the game."
SpygateHernandez,2002 Buccaneers were no joke. I loved watching that team play. 
SpygateHernandez,"Remember when Sean Lee got injured in camp by Zach Martin and everyone was all ""OMG DAE Jerry Jones is an idiot, Martin was a terrible pick, and the Cowboys will be lucky to win six games this year????"" 

Why didn't any of that happen? "
SpygateHernandez,Yet another Patriots stat that we can attribute to deflated footballs. 
SpygateHernandez,"Did the Jets have a bad *draft*? That's the subject at hand here. 

Of course, when you don't have any ammo for that argument, go ad hominem and change the subject. "
SpygateHernandez,"Leave it to you classy, mature Pats fans to use enlightened terms like ""retard."" Although I guess I can't blame you that much, that's the way I talked when I was a highschool freshman too. 

I wonder what that evidence that Goodell destroyed contains..."
SpygateHernandez,Don't forget Bledsoe!
SpygateHernandez,The Autumn Wind is a Raider...
SpygateHernandez,"Look, my policy has always been to lay my cards on the table. I do not like the New England Patriots, and I make my views loud and clear for all to see. 

I also have a bias towards being crude and provocative, which I consider a charming character trait. 

And if you really twist my arm, I will admit that Spygate was mostly about Goodell establishing his own power and Belichick being a dick who wouldn't stop breaking an admittedly arbitrary but nevertheless clear taping regulation because he felt he was above the rules. The Patriots didn't get any meaningful competitive advantage from the method they used to tape their opponents' defensive signals. So there. 

But Aaron Hernandez killed a bunch of people and Tom Brady lied about knowing who McNally was. And you can never take that away from me. 
"
SpygateHernandez,I hate the fucking Yankees so much
SpygateHernandez,"Well, *somebody* got their jimmies rustled because they used the wrong word...

I did not claim that it was an *admission* of guilt. The most plausible reason why he wouldn't hand over his phone *after the NFL offered to limit their investigation to only information pertinent to the deflation investigation* is that he had something he didn't want them to see. "
SpygateHernandez,"Thanks buddy. I recognize that the Jets sucked a big old bag of dicks last year, but at the end of the day, we're not the Browns, and that's really all that matters. "
SpygateHernandez,He hit him in the fucking head. 
SpygateHernandez,"He's not JaMarcus Russell but nobody is. JaMarcus Russell was fat as fucking shit. Roethlisberger is fat but he's not obese. 3-4% body fat is pretty significant (try losing 3-4% of your body fat if you don't believe me, it's really fucking hard.) An average male is between 17 and 22% body fat, so it's a narrow range. 

The point is that Brady is clearly in much, much better shape than either of them. And Roethlisberger is a bit of a fatty with a soft body. "
SpygateHernandez,You mean the two times you remember because it fits the narrative?
SpygateHernandez,"Posted specifically so that I could have this be my answer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvzLGlaCoRM"
SpygateHernandez,Burfict is just an asshole
SpygateHernandez,"And what particular players/philosophies is Garrett specifically responsible for that led to the talent on the Cowboys' roster? Did he draft Tony Romo? (Oh wait, nobody did.) 

Rod Marinelli gets the credit for coaching the shit out of mediocre talent on that defense, so I'm not giving him that either. 

Garrett was at the right place in the right time. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah I'm sure there are still plenty of Persians who take pride in Xerxes too. 
SpygateHernandez,One of them was the same homeless crack addict who told Haslam to select Manziel. 
SpygateHernandez,"And what does that have to do with whether or not he was MVP *in 2014*? By that logic, should we simply give him the award from now until he retires because he *has* done more with less?"
SpygateHernandez,Both of them are quite messy inside. 
SpygateHernandez,"Possibly the most under-appreciated player of his generation. Superstar talent, but played on a small market team and had a quiet personality. "
SpygateHernandez,Part of me thinks Brady will outlast him. 
SpygateHernandez,Was it poor?
SpygateHernandez,"Offensively no, but his defense was the only one that could compare to the Steel Curtain in the 70s. And Chuck Foreman was a damned good running back."
SpygateHernandez,"You should keep the commitments you make to the best of your ability, even if they wouldn't do the same for you. "
SpygateHernandez,"MacCagnan is love, MacCagnan is life, MacCagnan is Scottish..."
SpygateHernandez,I don't see what could possibly lead you to believe otherwise. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt;Lol**Browns** Mr. Edgelord

FTFY."
SpygateHernandez,"Much like a formula I race car, it's a fine machine that's useless in the wrong hands. "
SpygateHernandez,Because it's true. 
SpygateHernandez,"There is absolutely no dispute about Ray Guy being the greatest punter of all time. 

As for kickers I would go retro and say Lou ""The Toe"" Groza. "
SpygateHernandez,Why hasn't this been used against me before?
SpygateHernandez,"He really does seem like a nice, humble kid. 

I bet he's killed at least three people. "
SpygateHernandez,"Precisely. Put your cards on the table. See not only my flair, but my username! "
SpygateHernandez,Your username makes literally every comment you make seem automatically self-deprecating and therefore impossible to downvote. 
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah he would, but I feel like it's better all around if there's no tension in the building. "
SpygateHernandez,I certainly think the Vikings have a lot of potential but I don't know if the players have enough experience on defense at this point to really contend. It's more of a gut feeling than anything. 
SpygateHernandez,"Look at the angry Packer fan downvoting everything in your posting history. SMH. That's Browns level shit, man. "
SpygateHernandez,"Given that it's the Browns we're talking about, you might want to add /s. "
SpygateHernandez,"Ken O'Brien with Dan Marino still on the board.

O'Brien was a very good quarterback, but he was no Marino. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Nice unnecessary dig on Cleveland that has nothing to do with your question.


Thanks!"
SpygateHernandez,"It was just one of those games where you say to yourself, ""nobody believes in us, but why not Zoidberg?"" "
SpygateHernandez,Plus the decline of Marshall Faulk. 
SpygateHernandez,"That was also the universe paying us back for stealing him. But whatever. Logically, we can't suck *forever*, right?"
SpygateHernandez,"Tagliabeau was never nearly as controversial as Goodell (although granted, the scrutiny applied to the NFL was much lighter during his era, even up to his retirement in the mid-2000s)"
SpygateHernandez,"Oh I get it from his perspective, but I would also want to honor the commitment that I had made to the organization. "
SpygateHernandez,"Woah, this is a good one. Nice job with the comparison OP. 

Philly is such a wildcard at this point. Totally unknown commodity. The consensus on Minnesota is that the arrow is pointing upward, but just how steep is that upward slope? We really don't know. They seem to have a clear plan and philosophy in place, but it may take time to come to fruition. 

Right now I'd have to say Minnesota just because I think Philly got lucky a lot last year and I'm skeptical about their quarterback position. Unless they start Tebow, in which case #1 seed. "
SpygateHernandez,"I agree that you're not Wisconsin (as I said, no offense) and I actually like the Twin Cities a lot, but they are a small market in terms of population size. It's big enough to support all major sports and also Prince is from there, but the combined population of the Twin Cities is like what, a million people? That's a small market. "
SpygateHernandez,My real name is Ted Wells. 
SpygateHernandez,"One can only imagine how different the course of NFL history would be if Walsh had gotten the Cincinnati job. Montana was a couple of years younger than Anderson, but I feel like Walsh would have stuck with Anderson. 

Romo, however, is one of the best comeback quarterbacks in NFL history and few people seem to realize it. That was never Anderson's strong suit (it looks like he only had 10 in his career!) There's nothing wrong with being a frontrunner per se, but it is something you have to dock Anderson for. "
SpygateHernandez,"Only if you assume that the Wells had a pre-determined conclusion would the ""they just wouldn't say he handed over the necessary texts"" argument work. Wells was an independent investigator. "
SpygateHernandez,Dang. 
SpygateHernandez,"It's an endless source of humor for the rest of the country too. 

That's a badass username, BTW. "
SpygateHernandez,Defamation. 
SpygateHernandez,"I like Verrett, he's ""scrappy"" despite not being white. 

I would say Xavier Rhodes is going to be the next great CB though. "
SpygateHernandez,"I have no idea how Ozzie Newsome drafts so consistently. Also, outside of corners and receivers (where he seems to throw darts at the wall) Belichick is a fucking stud. "
SpygateHernandez,"I like ~~Trae Flowers~~ Tre McBride out of William and Mary a lot. I have a thing for small-school prospects. 

EDIT: There were like 90 players named ""Tre"" in this year's draft. Got my wires crossed. "
SpygateHernandez,"Browns fans, feel free to insult me all you want, because I love a good food fight, but please stop taking the jokes I make and just saying ""Oh yeah? Well [replace the word ""Browns"" with ""Jets.""] So there!"" Honestly, I root for the Jets, that's a pretty easy target. Please come up with something original. 
"
SpygateHernandez,"Nah, but that was less of a turningpoint in the history of the sport than Belichick going to the Jets. "
SpygateHernandez,"Great pick right there. He was projected as a first rounder for a while. Taking him with a fourth is a steal, and if his injury really does hamper him it won't be a big deal since it was a relative small investment. 

Spielman has a hot hand this year. "
SpygateHernandez,I DID NOT KNOW THAT
SpygateHernandez,I'm not necessarily sure about the 3-4 games part but as long as Aaron Rodgers is healthy (and Green Bay's defense is pretty darned good too) that division will run through Green Bay. 
SpygateHernandez,"No, you're confusing Terry Bradshaw with the Cleveland Browns' front office. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; As a NY Knicks fan it's bad enough suffering through so many shitty years. To get to the end of the season and not have the top pick with the worst record is heartbreaking.

I feel your pain on this one, but deep down I know this is payback for the fact that the Ewing draft was rigged. "
SpygateHernandez,I WILL TELL YOU WHAT POINT YOU ARE MAKING GODDAMMIT!
SpygateHernandez,It would mean he escaped rehab. 
SpygateHernandez,It's pathetic how quickly we as fans will immediately become interested in anything even remotely involving NFL teams. 
SpygateHernandez,I thought it was Soldier Field. 
SpygateHernandez,"We're two sides of the same coin, my friend. "
SpygateHernandez,"Vikings and Chargers. 

I also have a feeling that the Giants are going to win the NFC East. Please Eagles, keep this from happening. "
SpygateHernandez,"The draft picks really surprised me. I do think it's evidence of Goodell going beyond what the evidence presented in the Wells Report (which I admit was questionable - WTF was up with those pressure gauges?) justified. A lot of talking heads basically said ""even though the Wells Report cleared Belichick, I can't believe he didn't know about this so punish him"" which I honestly think is pretty absurd if you're using the Report as the basis for saying Brady should be punished. (To make it clear, I essentially think the loss of the draft picks were aimed at Belichick, although I also suspect Goodell might have taken them away in order to show the other owners that he wasn't being overly-favorable to Kraft.) "
SpygateHernandez,Roger Goodell destroyed them all.
SpygateHernandez,You have been modded at /r/nyjets (and /r/buffalobills)
SpygateHernandez,"No, the correct answer is ""It's Raining Men"" by The Weather Girls. Because your roster has depth. And I'm not talking about that kind of depth ;) "
SpygateHernandez,What makes you think I hate them? I just think they're hilariously and consistently bad at everything. 
SpygateHernandez,Sure you will. 
SpygateHernandez,DON'T YOU DARE EVER DOUBLE-COMMENT LIKE THIS AGAIN
SpygateHernandez,It doesn't have to make sense. 
SpygateHernandez,"God I hate these comments.

If you don't like the topic then don't click on it. It's pretty simple folks. "
SpygateHernandez,"Look at the point at which their careers overlap and then look at their winning percentages. Tarkenton was also playing for an expansion franchise in his early career. 

The fact that the *Steelers* won a greater proportion of Bradshaw's games is a reflection of the fact that he didn't play on an expansion team, and the fact that the *Steelers* managed to win *despite the fact that he clearly passed the ball worse* in those games means that they were winning in spite of the fact that he was a worse quarterback than Tarkenton and the Vikings lost (and they rarely did in the 70s) more often is *in spite of* the fact that they were aided in their efforts by a *better* passer. You can't use that kind of post hoc ergot prompter hoc reasoning. "
SpygateHernandez,"He's got every right to make his case to each commenter individually. It's a substantive point so if you don't like it, just skip past it. "
SpygateHernandez,"Did the union actually tell him not to turn his phone in? And again, you're begging the question by assuming that *Wells' portion* of the investigation was biased and out to hit Brady. This seems to be taken as a given by Patriots fans. 

Brady mostly got the suspension not because they were able to produce direct evidence (because he didn't hand over his phone or even screened records of it) but he didn't cooperate with the investigation and that's why he got suspended. Troy Vincent's letter made that pretty clear. If he really had nothing to hide, why didn't he simply cooperate with the investigation? It's not like he committed a *crime* and is in *legal trouble*. 

I simply don't see why anyone should believe that Wells was out to axe Brady. It's all question begging based on the report's conclusion. "
SpygateHernandez,You'd have to go back to the days of segregated schools and the NFL being an amateurish league to find that. 
SpygateHernandez,Looks like he was also the inspiration for the logo of the *New Yorker*
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Or good scouts to pick out QB talent.

This one."
SpygateHernandez,"lolBrowns is much like a man slipping on a banana peel. Old as the hills, and still effective. "
SpygateHernandez,I take what I can get as a fan of this franchise. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Your logic is ridiculous.

I'm not the one making assumptions about what would have happened in a couterfactual scenario. HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IF HE HANDED OVER HIS PHONE? You're begging the question *again!* 

&gt;If it was truly independant, why was McNally even interviewed by the NFL?

The NFL interviewed McNally initially before Wells was hired. Wells even told McNally he wanted a ""fresh start"" on the process. Why wasn't Goodell interviewed? Because he had nothing to do with whether the footballs were deflated or not. "
SpygateHernandez,"There was a really fat stupid kid on my highschool debate team who used to say ""that's a fallacy"" all the time and he smelled weird. 

Not saying you're wrong, just saying I read that in his voice in my head. "
SpygateHernandez,The judge should have sentenced him to asshole rehab instead. 
SpygateHernandez,"I noticed that in an act of great cosmic irony, the first draft that wouldn't have been booed to the ground by Jets fans since time immemorial was held in Chicago. 

Well played, NFL, well played. "
SpygateHernandez,I don't think I've ever seen a team rush as well and still lose the game as the Jets did at Miami this season. Even really bad quarterback play can usually net you a win if you can dominate the ground like that. 
SpygateHernandez,That was a hell of a check he made. I wasn't even mad. 
SpygateHernandez,"I don't know, the Napoleon complex is pretty strong with that one. "
SpygateHernandez,I never understood *Eraserhead* but it is one of my favorite movies. I *really* want David Lynch to just explain what it means. 
SpygateHernandez,This dude needs to lay off the hooch while he's writing. 
SpygateHernandez,"Didn't a source later revealed to be Aaron Kromer tell the media that he was lazy in his preparation though? That's what I remember from that big leak scandal when the shit really started hitting the fan around December. I could be wrong, but that was the impression I walked away with. "
SpygateHernandez,"I don't get it either. The way he plays the game, you can tell it's not about him. He's in the endzone with his teammates after every touchdown, a million times more excited for them than for himself. "
SpygateHernandez,"Anything to bring him down. 

He is too perfect. "
SpygateHernandez,"I have a hunch that he's made of carbon, like all lifeforms. "
SpygateHernandez,Enough that many of them will have health problems later in life. 
SpygateHernandez,"And with friends like Rivers, you will make enemies. Mostly in the birth control industry. "
SpygateHernandez,"I consider my judgement that Brady is clearly guilty and a lying fraud completely unbiased and unaffected by any personal feelings I may have. 

Please do not look at my username. That's just a coincidence. "
SpygateHernandez,That's way too many offensive players. I blame Goodell. 
SpygateHernandez,And a douchebag! 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah they do a great job of passing the ball on his behalf. 
SpygateHernandez,That game was such BS! Gotta hand it to the Steelers for beating not only the Colts but also the refs on that one. 
SpygateHernandez,I made that observation and therefore have a right to karma whore by pointing it out. 
SpygateHernandez,Not really. Quarterbacks threw it deep back then. He played small ball very efficiently. 
SpygateHernandez,"Deleted your comment out of shame I see. 

Welcome to the club. "
SpygateHernandez,I wish I possessed some pizza in my belly right now. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt;Fun Fact- Since the last time the Browns had a QB start all 16 games in a season, there have been 186 instances of a QB starting every game for a team in a single season, an average of exactly 6 such seasons per year for every other non-Browns team.

Marry me OP"
SpygateHernandez,"There's a significant difference between being non-cooperative on the one hand and lying on the other. Both are forms of obstruction, but we all recognize that one is much worse than the other. "
SpygateHernandez,"Chad Pennington's first shoulder injury. I truly believe that he could have been one of the greats. Maybe not Peyton or Brady, but he was a great decision maker and what he did in his career was amazing considering his injury history."
SpygateHernandez,Quit while you still can sunshine. 
SpygateHernandez,Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,I think we've arrived at a universal consensus on the issue of McNally being both overweight and unintelligent. 
SpygateHernandez,"This past month has been so good for the cities of New York, Buffalo, Miami, Indianapolis, and Baltimore (even with the rioting)"
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; put this one to bed

Just like your mother. "
SpygateHernandez,The team itself is pretty stacked but you will only go as far as your quarterback will take you. If they had a mid-range quarterback they could do battle with the Colts in the AFC South but with Hoyer and Mallet I really don't think they stand a chance against Indy. 
SpygateHernandez,Woah that was fast. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Didn't Tate sleep with Wilson's wife like the week before they won the Super Bowl?

That was nothing but scuttlebutt. 

&gt;Carroll runs a professional ship I think

He runs a damned good ship but I wouldn't call it professional. It has a very college-esque atmosphere about it. "
SpygateHernandez,"Exciting: Steelers and Packers. It will also be exciting to see how many times the Browns manage to turn it over. 

Boring: Jets and Bears"
SpygateHernandez,Just watch somebody will snag it before I can make it. 
SpygateHernandez,"I have a funny feeling that the Giants are going to win the NFC East.

The Vikings will probably be an improved team, but I don't know that their record will reflect that, plus that division still clearly runs through Green Bay. 

So I'll say Giants."
SpygateHernandez,This proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Peyton Manning is one of the gooniest looking NFL quarterbacks of all time. 
SpygateHernandez,The circumstances of the case lead me to believe that he asked him to lower it below the legal limit. Hence McNally took the balls into the bathroom. 
SpygateHernandez,He'd also probably fuck a bunch of fat toothless chicks as well. 
SpygateHernandez,It's a funny name. 
SpygateHernandez,"Is there a rule for ""intent"" on a hi-lo? An official after the game even said that it was a missed call. 

Beyond the hit by Harper there was also a hit by Sharper that I remember that I thought was more probably than not illegal. 

But aside from the question of illegal hits that took place during regulation, it was frustrating to watch the Saints benefit from some very shady calls on their overtime drive and end the game with a field goal. I'm actually pretty glad that rule changed afterwards. "
SpygateHernandez,Brett Hundley is black and plays for the Packers
SpygateHernandez,Literally a great moment. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; According to this one media who watched his first practice of the season then he has a ""source"" that told him about another two practices. That isn't evidence.

It is, it's simply evidence you don't find compelling. There's a difference. The guy saw him suck a bag of dicks and make no progress. McCown is the starter. He has a source (which your scare-quotes seem to imply is made up -- any evidence for that beyond your own gut?) confirming what he can see with his very eyes. 

"
SpygateHernandez,Thanks buddy. I consider my username to be one of my pathetic life's greatest accomplishments. 
SpygateHernandez,Metallica
SpygateHernandez,"My only point is that ""Browns"" is objectively funnier than ""Jags."" I didn't even replace the words in the joke, I just offered constructive criticism to OP by letting him know that Browns jokes are always funny, because they suck. "
SpygateHernandez,"Obviously it's way too early to tell... but we all know it's down to Carr and Bridgewater, with the other three a complete afterthought. 

Personally I would say Bridgewater. He was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL down the stretch last season, and he improved steadily after facing a murder's row of defenses. He has a great intuitive pocket awareness, and he's got Norv Turner to aid his development. On top of that, he's the better decision maker as of right now, and I personally don't think quality changes as much as people are inclined to think it does. The most successful quarterbacks in the NFL aren't necessarily the ones with the strongest arms or fastest legs, they're the ones who consistently make good decisions. I see a lot of that in Bridgewater. "
SpygateHernandez,That's not a bad thing. 
SpygateHernandez,You're goddamned right you are. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; I don't get the logic that the longer you coach the more talented the roster gets?

Not what I said at all. I said if you're around for a long time, *at some point* you'll get the opportunity to coach a talented roster, not that it would keep getting perpetually better. Just like the talent on Jeff Fisher's roster peaked in the early 2000s and dipped after that. 

What powers does Garrett have that separate him from previous coaches?"
SpygateHernandez,"I was young, but I feel like the consensus was that it was true at the time as well. "
SpygateHernandez,And they just keep giving me more and more ammo!
SpygateHernandez,I mostly feed off Kerrygold butter these days. That stuff is the crack of the food world. And it's helping me lose weight!
SpygateHernandez,"Nobody is saying those Vikings teams were scrubs, but Bradshaw clearly played with more offensive talent, especially in his receiving corps. 

The point is that *if you look at the period where their careers coincide,* Tarkenton consistently passed the ball better. This isn't a case of cherry picking dude, we both know that Tarkenton was clearly and comfortably the statistically superior quarterback, and there's essentially no way you can carve up the data to say otherwise. 

And the Steelers drafted Hall of Famers like they fucking grew on trees during the Noll era. They already had Joe Green on the roster and they added Blount the year he was drafted too. Harris came two years later and then they drafted *four* Hall of Famers in 1974. He had a shit ton of offensive talent on his teams. The Vikings on the other hand were *literally* an expansion team with shit talent and an incompetent HC in Norm Van Brocklin. It's just post hoc ergo prompter again to argue that Bradshaw was solely responsible for the Steelers ascent, and you're straying close to that territory. 

Tarkenton was just a better passer. Bradshaw played better in Superbowls but he was not a better passer or a better quarterback than Tarkenton because of that and that alone. Seven games between the two of them does not make a career. "
SpygateHernandez,"The problem is that if there is a perceived conflict of interest by a large number of people, an outcome consistent with one that would result from that bias (e.g. a Jets fan making a controversial ruling in favor of the Jets which has a decisive outcome on the game) will always be the reason why that outcome occurred in the minds of many, many people. The facts of the case will not matter, and they will conclude that the ref only ruled in favor of the Jets because he is a Jets fan. He won't get any benefit of the doubt. 

The same principle applies with all kinds of legal cases. That is, for example, why even Supreme Court judges recuse themselves from cases where they would have a perceived conflict of interest (e.g., in a case where one of the parties was a business that a judge had a major economic stake in, or where one of the parties was a personal friend of the judge.) "
SpygateHernandez,How do we even know if Tom Brady is his real name?
SpygateHernandez,"Oh, I thought you did. My mistake. "
SpygateHernandez,"No, the correct answer is ""It's Raining Men"""
SpygateHernandez,"The New York Motherfucking Jets, that's who. "
SpygateHernandez,"Whoops, brain freeze. Tre McBride from W&amp;M. 

There were a lot of players named ""Tre"" or some variation thereof this year. "
SpygateHernandez,"Great pick. Runningbacks won't win you championships by themselves, but the fact that the NFL realized that it had overvalued them for years has caused them to swing too far in the opposite direction. They're undervalued at this point. Gurley will be a beast. "
SpygateHernandez,"I said ""a quarterback."" No deal. "
SpygateHernandez,"You keep on bringing the same point up but I've already addressed it: just because nobody else maintains their integrity therefore you shouldn't either. I disagree. And I again do not care if nobody else behaves that way. Most other people like, cheat, and attempt to exploit others: should I therefore do the same? And should I do the same because ""nobody else cares"" about maintaining their integrity and they will think I'm foolish if I do? No. *They're* the ones who are wrong. "
SpygateHernandez,"No. Cavs fans somehow manage to be as arrogant and simultaneously thin-skinned as Patriots fans. 

You must SUFFER! "
SpygateHernandez,"Minnesota and Cleveland. 

I have no idea what Thompson is doing for Green Bay right now. "
SpygateHernandez,Little does he know that I was actually the one who got her pregnant... WITH MY DICK!
SpygateHernandez,"Not even professional football players can avoid the beauty that is lolBrowns. 

Pittsburgh and Baltimore have fielded some legendary defensive teams this past decade, don't get me wrong, but their statistical cause has been tremendously, tremendously aided by the parade of scrub quarterbacks the Browns have trotted out against them biannually. You'd think the Browns would have stumbled upon one by sheer dumb luck at this point. "
SpygateHernandez,"Well we did have Pennington at one point over a decade ago. That's something, right? RIGHT?!"
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; MLB

If by ""MLB"" you mean ""CLE"" then yes. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah I know what you mean, it was awesome when Champ Bailey intercepted that pass from Brady and ran it back 99 yards.

Wait, what were we talking about?"
SpygateHernandez,I don't think he's going to make the HoF. 
SpygateHernandez,Saved. 
SpygateHernandez,Your secondary is going to kick some ass next season. Although I'm not sure about the safety next to Smith. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Just an asshole then.

Funny, that's how I always hear people describe Cleveland. "
SpygateHernandez,B-B-B-Bennie and the Jetsssssssssssssssssssssssssss!
SpygateHernandez,"Actually what you stated is known as an opinion. Brady being a liar, on the other hand, is a fact. It's a rather simple distinction I guess you can't be expected to understand. "
SpygateHernandez,All I wanted to do was leave the world a better place than I found it. 
SpygateHernandez,Flair up coward. 
SpygateHernandez,Totally untrue. Take any scrub quarterback and release one PSI of pressure from the football and BOOM! He's the next coming of Joe Montana.
SpygateHernandez,I genuinely feel like Mike MacCagnan nailed free agency. 
SpygateHernandez,"I have no beef with the Red Sox, as a Met fan and Yankee hater. "
SpygateHernandez,It was just an offhaded comment. Leave it to the votes to determine whether or not it contributed to the discussion in the minds of the people who have participated in this thread. 
SpygateHernandez,"Love me or hate me, you gotta respect a username of this caliber. "
SpygateHernandez,Spyflation. 
SpygateHernandez,"On behalf of the Cleveland Browns, I'll say ""Every Day I Have the Blues"" by the late, great B.B. King. "
SpygateHernandez,"Damned right! Hey, wait a minute..."
SpygateHernandez,2010 AFC divisional playoffs. If we didn't stop Brady then and there he was going to steamroll to ring #4 at that point. AND HE GOT OUTPLAYED BY SANCHEZ LIKE A BITCH!!!
SpygateHernandez,This has not always been the case.
SpygateHernandez,All the Browns need to do to get me to stop is to start winning games. 
SpygateHernandez,"Immediately after I saw ""dirtiest"" and ""ever"" Romanowski came to mind. What a fucking douchebag. "
SpygateHernandez,"Woah, these are some harsh grades. Thank goodness Mel Kiper has no idea what he's talking about. "
SpygateHernandez,"**Will**:

- Teddy Bridgewater continues to improve as he did last season
- Their shit offensive line gets better either due to dramatic improvement from Matt Kalil or because any of the four offensive linemen they drafted manage to keep Teddy upright. 
- Their defense takes the next step, as Rhodes develops into a true shutdown corner and Waynes locks down the other side of the field. They also get their linebacker situation straightened out, and Everson Griffen has a monster pass rushing season. 
- They manage to emulate Seattle's formula for beating Green Bay, and they're able contain Stafford. They don't show up to the game drunk against the Bears. 

**Won't**

- Hard schedule, still unable to keep up with Green Bay. Rodgers still performs very well against them and they can't stop Lacy, which was a bigger problem for them last year than people realize. The Lions manage to beat them twice (although I think a split is more likely) and their recent history of futility at Soldier Field continues despite the current state of the Chicago Bears.
- Bridgewater regresses, and possibly gets injured due to the combo of his sleight frame (I know he's put on weight but he's still skinny) and a still-terrible offensive line. 
- They get shellacked with a tough schedule. They lose to the teams you'd expect them to lose to (Denver, Seattle, Green Bay twice) and they can't get over the hump against pretty-good teams like Arizona, Kansas City, or Detroit.
- They manage to sneak into the playoffs or even win their division with a high seed, but lose in heartbreaking, cosmological fashion a la 1998 or the 2009 NFC Championship Game. You know what? They end up playing the Saints in New Orleans in the palyoffs and every possible call goes against them while the Saints defense beats the living shit out of Bridgewater, pummeling him with illegal hits. They still manage to miss a gimme field goal. That's probably what will happen. God hates the Vikings. "
SpygateHernandez,Fucking right. It's like replacing bagels with donuts at work: it takes an OK thing and makes it amazing. 
SpygateHernandez,"Never reveal your idea without a patent pending. 

I also created the Mr. Peanut character :("
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; And we're talking about sports, so save your city nationalism for some other time.

Wise move to duck that one because you'd come up as empty as Mitt Romney's soul if you tried to go head to head with New York on that. 

&gt;So so so pathetic

I agree, it really is pathetic when you have to cheat and get Roger Goodell to destroy the evidence. "
SpygateHernandez,"To be fair, they weren't winning because of Hoyer, they were winning because they had the top pass defense in the NFL last year, and Hoyer played just well enough to win a couple of games for them. "
SpygateHernandez,"Dallas (call me crazy but I think the Giants are going to win their division) and Arizona. Maybe Philly, who knows what's going on there. 

I think the arrow is pointing up for Minnesota but they're not there yet. I also think Detroit still has some semblance of a window left. "
SpygateHernandez,"Just look at his face and greasy haircut right [here](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.168778!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/alg-steelers-ben-roethlisberger-jpg.jpg) (which IIRC is from the sexual assault incident's press conference.) 

Dude is moobin out. I'm going to start calling him ""The Pittsburgh  Doughboy."" 

But he's a great quarterback. A great, fat quarterback. "
SpygateHernandez,Everything for the past 40 years. 
SpygateHernandez,I aim to please. 
SpygateHernandez,"Pal, I'm from New York. I take shits that have a population of 3.5 million. 

It's about quality, not quantity. Just take solace in the fact that you don't live in Wisconsin because I've been there and it's full of fat hillbillies. "
SpygateHernandez,"The Patriots actually expect us to believe that McNally referred to himself as ""the deflator"" because he was trying to lose weight? This is simply an insult to the intelligence of football fans, meaning that it will probably work. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah he really did improve significantly down the stretch visually. Steep learning curve too!
SpygateHernandez,"Nah, he's guilty until proven innocent. "
SpygateHernandez,Bills and Rams
SpygateHernandez,Those things matter a lot more than people appreciate. 
SpygateHernandez,My heart says San Diego but my head says Giants :(
SpygateHernandez,pathetically enough the recent history of the jets is superior to that of the browns
SpygateHernandez,What about Antonio Brown? Devon Still? 
SpygateHernandez,"Pass rusher (DT or DE, although DEs are cooler) or corner. 

If I had to go offense it would of course be running back. "
SpygateHernandez,"I don't think I'm going to do a whole list, but the 2010 Patriots really do deserve to be on here. "
SpygateHernandez,All of the racist commentators in the sports media would criticize his day care center constantly.
SpygateHernandez,Just came here to say I get the reference behind /u/MakinBaconOnTheBeach 's name. 
SpygateHernandez,"A lot of people like Springsteen. I don't care for his music personally but I kind of get why some people like it a lot. 

I like classic rock (among other genres) but I've just never been into Springsteen. His songs have too many words and not enough melody for my taste. "
SpygateHernandez,Yes. 
SpygateHernandez,You could even slice it that way but assuming the bust rate is relatively stable it would be the same
SpygateHernandez,"SMH. Browns fans, if you wanna step into the arena, you've gotta be prepared. Unlike the Browns on Sundays. "
SpygateHernandez,"If he told you that I wouldn't trust him. He's apparently willing to lie to the whole country. Can't be trusted. 

Of course he did bang a chick once and break up with her while she was pregnant, but I know you Pats fans like to pretend that never happened. "
SpygateHernandez,Inferior competition. 
SpygateHernandez,Apparently not. 
SpygateHernandez,Disappoint me. 
SpygateHernandez,The more you deny it the truer it becomes. 
SpygateHernandez,Tom Brady had McNally deflate footballs on his behalf. He cheated and then lied about it. 
SpygateHernandez,That is incredibly petty and small of you. You have therefore been modded at /r/nyjets. 
SpygateHernandez,"If you're gonna make a non-topical argument, keep going. Good job. The Jets will probably finish with the worst record in the division and that has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the Packers had a shit draft. "
SpygateHernandez,Ooooooh that'd be a good one. Stafford would be in a similar situation to this previous season with our shiny new defense. 
SpygateHernandez,I AGREE AND HE GOT YOU TO THE SUPERBOWL BUT MOST OF /R/NFL IS ACTING LIKE HE'S A SCRUB AND A HACK BECAUSE OF ONE FUCKING PASS SO I ASSUMED YOU WERE IN THEIR CAMP I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISTAKE AND ANY INCONVENIENCE IT HAS CASED YOU
SpygateHernandez,I gotta up vote a counter-zinger like that. But something tells me Gronk prefers women of the whorish and unintelligent species. 
SpygateHernandez,"He's what they call a ""Blake Griffin."" "
SpygateHernandez,"There wouldn't really be one, at least as of right now. 

I was just pointing out that Rate+ is a great stat that gives you historical context. "
SpygateHernandez,"They are both virtually identical in terms of passing effectiveness over their careers, but I would go with Wilson because his ability to run is a huge asset in keeping drives alive and he makes fewer bad decisions. "
SpygateHernandez,That isn't a fallacy because I'm not making an assertion about a logical error in your argument. Dummy. 
SpygateHernandez,Evidence?
SpygateHernandez,"Wow, I'm right up there with Ryan Gossling then!"
SpygateHernandez,Excellent. Week one bye. 
SpygateHernandez,I'm genuinely interested. I want to see somebody go Jeffrey Kessler on my ass. 
SpygateHernandez,"I find your attempt to write a coherent English sentence ""adorable"" as well. Of course, *as of 2015* the Jets are a better team but I guess it was best for you to ignore that point. "
SpygateHernandez,Make it definitely he will. 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah it's great isn't it!?
SpygateHernandez,"I watched that game and let's not get carried away, because he was also in coverage on the Bucs' previous scoring drive that blew the lead in the 4th quarter. Thankfully for him Bridgewater was able to execute one of his many 4th quarter comebacks. It was against a bad defense, but still, it's not something every rookie can do. 

Barr looked great in 2014 but he still has a lot to learn. Most of the time, your quarterback won't be able to bail you out after you blow a lead like that. He was lucky he was playing with Teddy that day. "
SpygateHernandez,There's probably close to a 100 pound difference between them. 
SpygateHernandez,Not knowing who Jim McNally was. And that is where the whole house of cards comes tumbling down. 
SpygateHernandez,"Deion Sanders and Night Train Lane. Pick your flavor, but they were baaaaaaaaaaaaad men. "
SpygateHernandez,It's weird how some games are up there in full but others have been taken down. 
SpygateHernandez,"Yup, brainfreeze!"
SpygateHernandez,"It was Steve Wozniak that he got flubbed up on, but he made up for it with that answer about shark fin soup. 

To be fair though, he did benefit from getting both of the daily doubles in double Jeopardy. "
SpygateHernandez,Oh my God I swear his gums have gums that have gums
SpygateHernandez,"Oh my God...this...I...it's just beautiful. 

I...I think I want to hug a Dolphins fans. "
SpygateHernandez,"I understand that Jimmy Garoppolo is a handsome young man, but I seriously doubt that Bill Belichick wants to have sex with him. "
SpygateHernandez,"There was one where Peyton gave a peptalk to the camera. He said ""Hey, I heard you got a bad haircut, but don't worry, it'll grow back. And one piece of advice: high and tight with no sideburns. I've been rocking this since I was 13."" 

I had just gotten a devastating haircut when this commercial came out. It was like the universe was speaking to me through Peyton."
SpygateHernandez,"This is literally the most idiotic comment I have ever seen. 

That's the joke, Einstein. "
SpygateHernandez,I am going to go ahead an interpret this as a concession of guilt. 
SpygateHernandez,Sanchez jersey
SpygateHernandez,You eat what you are. 
SpygateHernandez,"In one sense, San Diego, because Rivers is the fucking man. 

In another sense, Indy, because their owner and Goodell killed Brady, for which I shall be forever thankful. Even if he wins his appeal, people will think he's a cheater and a liar. They did a fantastic job of shaping public opinion.  "
SpygateHernandez,She's a smart woman. 
SpygateHernandez,Dameshek is a fucking turd with an annoying voice and face. I really want to punch it. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; simple and doesn't require in-depth research

Look, I've heard the *theory* plenty of times /u/BallFaceMcDickButt, but what I want is the kind of empirical, factual evidence that two men of science such as ourselves know that there should be if the theory is true. "
SpygateHernandez,"It's funny: I love the way Rivers, Brees, Brady, and to a lesser extent Peyton pump their teams up, but at the same time I also admire the opposite flavor: Montana-esque quiet leadership. I don't mean to compare Bridgewater to Montana in terms of ability, but that's a similar quality I see in both of them. "
SpygateHernandez,Do you hands hurt from grasping those straws so hard?
SpygateHernandez,"It kind of is considering how many quarterbacks and pro football players in general Texas produces. 

Even more surprisingly, Florida apparently has none!"
SpygateHernandez,"He looks like a stripclub DJ in that picture. 

Roethlisberger is kind of a dick and I really want to punch him in the face, but not because he's kind of a dick. I don't know how to explain it, and it's not even out of malice towards him, but I just kind of want to know what it would feel like to punch *that* face. More for the experience if anything than out of spite. "
SpygateHernandez,"Taste our sour, sour grapes Brady. We have been cultivating them for 14 years. "
SpygateHernandez,"Nah Jimmy, tell them how you *really* feel. "
SpygateHernandez,Upvoted for the joke in poor taste about child abuse. 
SpygateHernandez,"""I believe the Cleveland Browns will win the Superbowl this year."" "
SpygateHernandez,"The drama definitely is not on purpose so I won't give him credit for that. 

What he is doing is also bad for the long-term interests of the game. Taglieabeau managed to keep peace within the castle for most of his tenure. The players uniformly hate Goodell. "
SpygateHernandez,This gif perfectly captures the modern history of the Cleveland Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah that actually sounds about right. 
SpygateHernandez,How appropriate that it was the Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,I consider it my crown jewel. 
SpygateHernandez,I am a douchebag and an idiot. It was only natural. 
SpygateHernandez,"I disagree with the ""good"" part. "
SpygateHernandez,Question begging. How do we know what gauge they used?
SpygateHernandez,Odell Beckham was injured last season. And Antonio Brown exists. 
SpygateHernandez,What a shocking username you have. 
SpygateHernandez,I also hate the Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,You just wasted two comments. 
SpygateHernandez,Paul Tagliabeau knew what was best for the game. He never should have left. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Omg you're funny. 

Yeah but there's more to me than how I smell. "
SpygateHernandez,"Jets @ Patriots 2010 Divisional Playoffs

Saints @ 49ers 2011 Divisional Playoffs

2006 AFC Championship Game"
SpygateHernandez,"She's no Floyd Mayweather, that's for sure. "
SpygateHernandez,Let's not go nuts here. 
SpygateHernandez,"He didn't *give it out*, Troy Vincent technically did that, but it was clearly Goodell's doing. 

I think he's fucked up on a lot of things but he has done well on others. Bountygate was one of them (that was an actual issue of institutional control because it involved half of a team and it's not plausible that the coach wouldn't know about it, unlike deflated footballs) and he is protecting the future of the sport by taking steps to reduce concussions, although he blatantly fucking liked to the players by arguing that retired players health problems aren't the result of their football careers. Jamal Lewis was like 32 years old and couldn't even drive around his home town without getting lost. Gimme a break. 

I do have some sympathy for what happened with the Rice/Hardy/Peterson shitstorm though. How are you supposed to handle that? There wasn't a clear precedent, and the NFL is ultimately a private employer. Just because these guys are public figures as a result of their job doesn't mean they should be treated differently than employees of any other industry. 

I can see why he came down the way he did on Spygate. It really wasn't because the Patriots did anything that gave them an outrageous or unfair competitive advantage. They got hammered on a technicality that said ""you can tape defensive signals in front of 80,000 people from this location but not this one."" They really got hammered because the league circulated a memo to all the teams (clearly aimed at the Patriots) telling them to knock it off, but Belichick basically gave him the finger and kept doing it, later claiming that he misunderstood the language of the memo (which I don't believe.) It was punishment for non-compliance and it was also to set a precedent that if you don't comply with the league, you'll get the hammer (remember, Goodell was still a brand new commissioner in 2007.) 

Ultimately, Goodell has been a PR nightmare for the NFL, but a great deal of why people just hate his guts is because sports fans are stupid and irrational. They'll remember the thing that the commissioner did that they hated while ignoring many other, less headline-grabbing things that were good. He's a complete politician who makes his decisions by putting his finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing, and that pisses a lot of people off because he's clearly disingenuous, but honestly there are worse things in the world than that. 

However, he is ultimately a fuckwit. They should just replace him with Matt Birk. "
SpygateHernandez,"What was that probable cause that was within the rules that explains how the Patriots knew those plays the Rams had never run before? 

Either Belichick was spying on the Rams or he's such a supercalafragilisticexpialidocious coach that the had his team run checks for plays that they had never seen before. Yet apparently I'm the delusional one. 

I guess that this is what I should expect from a fanbase that is bending over backwards to convince itself that ""deflator"" is a term for weight loss. "
SpygateHernandez,Jason Campbell
SpygateHernandez,"You and me both, brother. 

Another case in point: Johnny Manziel. "
SpygateHernandez,"I was thinking of making a thread called ""What NFL players do you suspect are homosexuals?"" but I think it would probably get taken down. I legit want to hear what people think though. "
SpygateHernandez,"I couldn't really hear him articulate his views, nor do I think that was the best situation to ask for a comment. 

"
SpygateHernandez,"I would agree that in some point in the future they're going to be tough to beat, I'm just not sure that the corps is experienced enough at this point. They could definitely make some noise this year, but I need to see this team post a winning record before we start getting ahead of ourselves. "
SpygateHernandez,24? Are you European or something?
SpygateHernandez,I don't know who that person is but I immediately like his style. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; omission 

admission"
SpygateHernandez,But isn't randomly selecting a QB essentially *exactly* what they did?
SpygateHernandez,I personally think we're better off treating individuals as just that: individuals rather than members of racial or ethnic tribes. The difference between throwing around racial slurs and the mentality behind segregation is one of degree rather than of kind. 
SpygateHernandez,"I think the Jets' defense has improve enough to cover for a significant amount of Geno's warts. The quarterback situation, on the other hand, is superior to the Browns' but still awful. "
SpygateHernandez,"Didn't that team also have Gale Sayers? 

What freaking bum was their quarterback? "
SpygateHernandez,"You have to consider what he had to work with in terms of your assessment though. He had a giant slew of injuries, including to his first *two* quarterbacks, and still managed to make it to the playoffs. And prior to that, he took over a Colts' team without a great deal of talent (and Andrew Luck did *not* have a great rookie season in terms of pass efficiency) and kept things from falling apart. 

His resume as a HC is short at this point but very impressive in terms of what we've seen in my opinion.  "
SpygateHernandez,"The Browns' quarterback situation is so bad that Geno Smith would be the unquestioned starter. 

The truth hurts sometimes. "
SpygateHernandez,"I keep saying this: Geno sucks but we both know he'd start for Cleveland no question. And that is not something I say to defend Geno, it is something I say to disparage the Browns. "
SpygateHernandez,And Manziel couldn't pass in either of them. 
SpygateHernandez,"What about the high-lo hit that he threw the interception on? That one was a big deal because the rule had been changed because it took Brady out for the prior season so everybody knew about it, and IIRC one of the game officials later stated explicitly that it should have been called an illegal hit. It also resulted in a turnover (IIRC). "
SpygateHernandez,"He makes a fair point on 4QCBs. Having a lot of them is great, but if you're putting the game away early you won't even need them. It would be more telling if we knew what his success rate in 4QCB situations was. 

And I think the point about his career passer rating is well-taken too. Passer rating does the best job of any stat (besides maybe ANY/A) of giving you an all-encompassing metric of how well a quarterback passes the ball. Bledsoe was OK at best in that department. IIRC he never even broke a passer rating of 90 in a season."
SpygateHernandez,"No, Pats cheated. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah it's actually an old jazz standard. 
SpygateHernandez,I don't really see how that's relevant. It could be pertaining to past events or future plans. 
SpygateHernandez,"You done fucked up son. 

Fran Tarkenton fucking tells it like it is. And you just opened yourself up for many humorous jabs at Terry Bradshaw's intelligence. "
SpygateHernandez,Touche. 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah it did start to unravel a lot at the end of season 2. 
SpygateHernandez,"Wow, you whipped me right there worse than the Steelers have whipped the Browns for the past 15 years. "
SpygateHernandez,"Peyton is always good for at least one instance of pissing down his leg per postseason. He doesn't do it *every* time, but he always does it at least once. "
SpygateHernandez,The Cardinals managed to be in plenty of games without a quarterback (no offense to whatshisface but I don't consider him a quarterback.) 
SpygateHernandez,"Keep telling yourself that. The Browns have fucked you over much worse. 

And the dude that banged that skank was from L.A., a city I can respect. "
SpygateHernandez,"Could you call Randy Moss the best receiver in the NFL after his rookie season? If it's OK for Moss, why not Zoidberg?"
SpygateHernandez,That's what *he* said!
SpygateHernandez,Best euphemism ever.
SpygateHernandez,I'm sure Chip Kelly has caused a major boom in Philadelphia-area liquor sales since the draft. 
SpygateHernandez,I also predict that the Browns will still suck. 
SpygateHernandez,"Eh, no worries. Sometimes it's hard to see things right in front of your nose because they're out of focus!"
SpygateHernandez,"Goodell probably had it destroyed, just like the Spygate tapes. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Also, I cheat, and my team cheats, and I'll just teach GOAToppolo to cheat too.

Boom. "
SpygateHernandez,"He was mostly into soulless 80's pop rock, but that is still a damned fine comment. "
SpygateHernandez,*Ten* was a fucking boss album. 
SpygateHernandez,"It makes sense. There is only so much a running back can do, even a generational one like AP or Barry. "
SpygateHernandez,"There is objectively not much to like about my team, and it is incredibly fun to rustle the jimmies of Pats fans. You should try it some time. "
SpygateHernandez,"I wouldn't be surprised if they fell within that range, although I don't think they beat a team with a winning record last year (granted, they were close in a lot of their losses and football is a flukey sport like that, but still) and this year's schedule is harder.

As long as Aaron Rodgers keeps playing at the level we've grown accustomed to, the NFC North will run through Green Bay. "
SpygateHernandez,"I get that he's a genetic superfreak, but at the same time he is getting older and he appears to be disgruntled even though my understanding is that he likes Zimmer. "
SpygateHernandez,Fuck this sub and it's anti-dank meme bias. 
SpygateHernandez,You're in full on attack mode and I can only assume that's because you have concluded that Tarkenton was in fact better. It's the same reason I try to demean the Patriots so much. 
SpygateHernandez,Not the 2010 divisional playoffs against the Jets?
SpygateHernandez,"What wonderful reasoning. ""All I see you do is post about the Browns, therefore all you do is post about the Browns."" 

All I see is Browns fans downvote everything I say en masse. I guess they need to get a life. "
SpygateHernandez,"Given that Tom Brady is a liar, how do we know if he's *really* from California?"
SpygateHernandez,Rodger Goodell is actually a competent man who looks like a lying jackass because he has a difficult job. 
SpygateHernandez,A US federal court would have to declare Ted Thompson and Ryan Grigson as mentally incompetent (it would have to be a federal court because it's a form of interstate commerce!)  
SpygateHernandez,"CFL for him. Hope this kid turns it around, but he's made some bad life decisions up to this point. "
SpygateHernandez,A lot of people feel like he was robbed in 2009. 
SpygateHernandez,"Marrone deserves the demotion, that guy was a total asshole. "
SpygateHernandez,I disagree. It *really* says something if you're too scared to losing fake internet points to flair up. 
SpygateHernandez,"""Lyman Shamburg"""

SpygateHernandez,"&gt; 3-4 months

Roughly the length of Brady's impending suspension. "
SpygateHernandez,"I still don't understand why they drafted a physical press corner like Rhodes to play in a pure zone scheme, but with Zimmer there it appears to be working out like gangbusters. "
SpygateHernandez,It's sad to see a player with such a hilariously ironic nickname go. 
SpygateHernandez,"Couch to Pederson to Wynn to Holcomb to Garcia to McCown to Dilfer to Frye to Anderson to Quinn to Dorsey to Gradkowski to Delhomme to McCoy to Wallace to Weeden to Lewis to Campell to Hoyer to Manziel to Shaw. 

Some all time greats right there. "
SpygateHernandez,The number of people in the world who feel that they *shouldn't* make more money for what they do is comparable to the number of Flat Earthers. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; We still have no Belichick in games today because he's not part of any union and won't individually licence his likeness.

My understanding is that coaches don't belong to a *union* per se, but an *association* (more like a trade group than a union I guess) that handles likeness licensing. "
SpygateHernandez,"Damned good, especially against the pass, which is what matters. "
SpygateHernandez,"I beat up my kid, now give me money. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah there are a lot of people defending the Packers draft ITT. 
SpygateHernandez,TDs alone don't tell you much. Teddy's passer rating was virtually identical to Ryan and Newton's.
SpygateHernandez,"If you didn't know who they were, which one would you think is younger just by looking at them?"
SpygateHernandez,I counter with mine. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Not to add to the circlejerk

We both know this is a lie. "
SpygateHernandez,Part of the issue was he answered too quickly. You could see he was getting pretty excited and the competitive juices might have been flowing a little too fast. 
SpygateHernandez,What a surreal moment that was. 
SpygateHernandez,"Any one of Rivers, Romo, and Roethlisberger, because they have been overlooked for far too long. "
SpygateHernandez,Simeon Rice. 
SpygateHernandez,"Really all women from the northeast corridor. 

EDIT: I also realized Jenn Sterger is a Jets fan and she is also a whore so yes. "
SpygateHernandez,Incognito is a straightup son of a bitch
SpygateHernandez,Touche. IIRC they Dolphins were in the AFC Championship game against the Patriots that year. 
SpygateHernandez,"There is a pretty clear difference between a systemic bounty scheme that involved half the team in the Saints' case (which also in my view makes it much less plausible that Payton knew nothing about it) on the one hand and Belichick not knowing about Brady's personal equipment preferences on the other. The number of people on the team and in the organization is simply much larger in the former case. And weren't there emails copied to Sean Payton about the bounty scheme? Maybe he didn't read them, but still. 

Look, if we as Patriots haters are going to use the Wells report as our basis to bludgeon the Patriots, we have to be consistent about it. We can't claim that the reports conclusion is sufficient evidence to indict Brady while claiming that it must be wrong about Belichick because Belichick simply must have known because your intuition tells you that Belichick would probably know something like that (then again, that's about as strong as the evidence against Brady was, but I digress). 

The point is, Tom Brady lied to America, especially the children. 

Brady lied, people died. "
SpygateHernandez,/r/perfectfit
SpygateHernandez,"I think it *does* indicate, however, the he still wants to play for another team (although truth be told I don't know if he normally doesn't attend OTAs but my impression is that he does.) "
SpygateHernandez,"No, Spygate Hernandez is actually my real name. It is simply a coincidence that it also encapsulates two of the biggest scandals in the history of the football team that is the bane of my existence. 

I mean, what are the odds, right?"
SpygateHernandez,Brady that season was unstoppable. Just pure domination. It was true David and Goliath shit. 
SpygateHernandez,His argument was that things didn't look so good when you actually broke down the tape. 
SpygateHernandez,"Charles Barkley. He's not even associated with football, I just find him absolutely hilarious. 

Or maybe Terry Bradshaw, whom I also find highly amusing. His would make a damned good story from the serious side as well. "
SpygateHernandez,"Wow look at you making sweeping conclusions based on fucking nothing. 

This team has a damned good defensive line, but the precedent for corners being productive into their 30s (which Cro and Revis both are) is weak. This team hasn't been relevant since 2010 and our quarterback is a huge question mark at best. You really don't get how being a Jets fan works if you don't secretly hate the team somewhat. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah that would take a while! Plus different eras would affect things too. 
SpygateHernandez,Williams! Getting the best player in the draft with pick number 6 was a great value. 
SpygateHernandez,What? I didn't include any players on any list. I associated no list with this factoid. 
SpygateHernandez,"Probably not. I would say Taylor has a better chance than Dillon but I doubt even he makes it past the first round of cuts. Two very fine players to be sure, but not HoF caliber. Nobody was confusing those guys with Earl Campbell or Eric Dickerson. "
SpygateHernandez,Oh no I totally get it. No worries. 
SpygateHernandez,I think the Saints are going to bounce back with a vengeance. 
SpygateHernandez,McFadden and Williams have such extensive injury histories though. Even worse than Murray had before this season. 
SpygateHernandez,"It seems to me that the Vikings are loaded with young talent at pretty much every defensive position at this point. They're not totally stacked like Seattle, but they have quality players at every level of their defense. This team is going to be fun to watch. "
SpygateHernandez,"I don't think he's doing any harm per se, he just comes off as arrogant and unintelligent in a very frat boy kind of way. "
SpygateHernandez,Criticizing Aaron Rodgers on /r/NFL
SpygateHernandez,"I'm not even saying Romo isn't consistently good, I'm saying Anderson *led* the league (which gives you a better idea of how well he played relative to his peers) in important categories more often. It gets more obscure when you have to start adding multi-elemental records (above X passer rating *and* X completion percentage), and it's more impressive to lead the NFL in a single category as Anderson did with so many different things. "
SpygateHernandez,Sorry man. Now I know what Tom Brady (who is a liar) feels like ;) 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah those guys were a couple of assholes
SpygateHernandez,It would be the only hope the Cleveland Browns have. 
SpygateHernandez,"I would love to say the Jets, but it's hard not to go with Seattle. "
SpygateHernandez,"It's close enough to a fact that we might as well run with it, much as we can with ""Seattle is the best team in the NFCW"" or ""New England will win the AFCE."" It isn't even remotely irrational to make that assumption, dummy. 

And of course, every Browns fan in the universe just says ""well JETS ba ha ha!"" whenever I point out that their team objectively sucks. Look, the Jets suck too, but that doesn't mean that the Browns don't suck (and haven't sucked in a special, magical way since 1999)"
SpygateHernandez,"I really don't think he is though. 

This is a totally bullshit reason but at the same time it's completely valid: when I look into his eyes, I just don't see the soul of a champion. Look into Brady's eyes and you can see that he has the spirit of a man who has what it takes to fucking dominate the NFL and FUCKING DOMINATE the Indianapolis Colts. In Garoppolo's eyes I see only weakness and timidity. 

No man has the warrior-soul of Brady. "
SpygateHernandez,If anyone says Namath I will fucking cut you
SpygateHernandez,He currently has the longest streak of perfect passer ratings in NFL history. 
SpygateHernandez,Annexation of Puerto Rico. 
SpygateHernandez,Oh my God he's a fucking dirty player and you know it. 
SpygateHernandez,BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
SpygateHernandez,"There will be a man named Joe Flacco.

That is all. "
SpygateHernandez,I cannot not upvote the Gos. 
SpygateHernandez,"One thing that I think is worth noting is that different coaches may work better or worse with different teams and different team cultures. 

Pete Carroll works well for the Seahawks, a team full of young players with brash, swaggering attitudes. He's a cheerleader who runs a pretty loose ship. He might not work as well if he was coaching a more veteran-laden team with a different relationship with the game. 

Belichick tends to pick a lot of players who are intelligent and who have their college degrees. He expects a lot of them mentally, and that might not work for a team with a significant number of players who aren't as bright. 

McCarthy presides over a team without a lot of big egos (outside of the quarterback) and if he coached a team like the Seahawks I'm not sure that they would respond as well. 

Etc. "
SpygateHernandez,Marvin Lewis would fuck it up
SpygateHernandez,"At the very least I don't think the record will reflect that. The NFC and AFC West are going to be waaaaaaay better than the NFC South was last year. And on top of that, the Browns *still* don't have a quarterback. "
SpygateHernandez,That man is a goddamned hero. 
SpygateHernandez,McNally and Jastremski seem too unintelligent to come up with a pun like that. McNally in particular strikes me as a fat idiot who is also ugly and smells bad based on the lower-class grammar of his text messages. 
SpygateHernandez,"I disagree that it was poor coaching. 

Green Bay had the lead for almost the entire game and Rodgers simply couldn't pass the ball that day. His passer rating was only 55, which is 26 points *worse* than it was against Seattle on opening night. Running the ball with the lead, especially when your defense keeps producing turnovers, is a good strategy. Rodgers just had a lot of trouble against top pass defenses this year (look at his performance against top pass defenses this year by DPR and compare it to how Brady and Manning performed). "
SpygateHernandez,"Young was the better quarterback and you fucking know it, you slags. "
SpygateHernandez,Funny how they actually made one and it happened.
SpygateHernandez,Only a Giants fan would have that as their favorite. 
SpygateHernandez,"I don't know, offensive linemen are difficult to predict."
SpygateHernandez,"I'd potentially grant you TO but Freeman? It was pretty clear even at the time that he was a Favre byproduct. 

Plus, TO had Steve Young throwing him the ball. Moss did not. "
SpygateHernandez,Well fucking duh. I'm saying that Brady will play for a long time because he's still in exceptional shape and his body can withstand what little punishment he takes. The only major injury he's ever had was a freak accident. Ben is just fat and out of shape. Ugly also. 
SpygateHernandez,Belichick to the Jets. Followed closely by Belichick sticking with Brady over Bledsoe. That was a huge mistake in my (sarcastic and bitter) opinion. 
SpygateHernandez,"You know for a goddamned fact that mine is way wittier, and the number of times people have either complimented me on my username, said ""you rustled my jimmies"" or gotten pissed off at it is too high to count. Plus I've spawned imitators including but not limited to:

- TuckgateSpynandez
- SpyflateTucknandez
- TomBradyLied2America (my idea)
- TomBradyLiedToMurica

I am the Michael Jordan of bitter spite. Brady can never take that away from me. "
SpygateHernandez,"Probably about as hard as it is for Jimmy Haslam to see with his head buried in his own ass. 

One thing that is pretty cool to see, however, is your team winning a playoff game within your lifetime. Maybe Browns fans will know that feeling one day. "
SpygateHernandez,Roger Goodell and his legal team. Shout out to the Colts for arranging the sting as well!
SpygateHernandez,There's more truth to it than you realize. 
SpygateHernandez,"Incorrect. The edge on defense is not slight, it is very significant. Look at what the Jets added this offseason. The only question mark is linebacker. And even though Geno Smith sucks, he's appreciably better than Josh McCown, who *really* sucks and is somehow still parlaying a handful of good games with Chicago several years ago into NFL jobs. "
SpygateHernandez,The safety next to Smith might have to remain a weak link. You just can't have superstars at every position with the salary cap. Although personally I would take that money out from overpaid receivers and spend it on defense or the o-line. 
SpygateHernandez,"Ken Anderson, and the modern Ken Anderson that is Philip Rivers"
SpygateHernandez,What makes you think I'm a Browns fan?
SpygateHernandez,ITT: mothers being called whores
SpygateHernandez,No offense to OP but I just had to upvote this
SpygateHernandez,"Hah hah hah it gives me enormous satisfaction to see you twist your panties in a bunch over this. 

The Browns bring this upon themselves. "
SpygateHernandez,"What did *that* have to do with Manziel? That was a observation about Browns fans, not Manziel. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah, and they act like you shouldn't have your own separate but equal schools and water fountains too! I blame the Beatles. "
SpygateHernandez,"Heh heh heh, look at this guy taking barbs at himself! How charming!"
SpygateHernandez,"Well, I can tell you're not Aaron Kromer. "
SpygateHernandez,*slow clap*
SpygateHernandez,"You forgot ""iconic haircut"""
SpygateHernandez,Yeah that one was pretty egregious 
SpygateHernandez,No. Deflategate stays. *You* go!
SpygateHernandez,"Precisely. Brady is actually a fucking scrub, and only looks like Joe Montana because of deflated footballs and little birdies in his ear. 

Pennington would have been better if he had stayed healthy.

Shit, I don't even believe that last part. "
SpygateHernandez,"That Giants defense was (and remains) mediocre when they don't have a lead. But Eli gave them leads, and they were the best in the league at protecting them. "
SpygateHernandez,Get on a horse of some kind before you tell me to get off of mine. The lowest hanging fruit is also the funniest fruit. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; ~~unfunny~~ **incredibly funny**.

FTFY
"
SpygateHernandez,If you could manage to find that thread I think a lot of people (including myself) would be interested in reading it and appreciate it. 
SpygateHernandez,I don't know this for a fact but I feel like the Vikings don't have a lot of highly-paid players though. 
SpygateHernandez,Also an apt description of the Cleveland Browns. 
SpygateHernandez,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvyEJvB0SEM
SpygateHernandez,They're not even the most complete team in their division. 
SpygateHernandez,Yeah he's great!
SpygateHernandez,"Stats are a good means of evaluating a player's effectiveness, and you don't ""watch tape."" You are not a scout. "
SpygateHernandez,"You can't reliably make that conclusion based on that evidence. 

The evidence you provided was different in type from the evidence that the Browns are intent to move on from Manziel. The evidence about Bradford and Co. was speculation (and labeled as such) about potential roster moves based on what might make sense for the team. This report is based on the fact that Manziel is visibly struggling in practice. 

Just because the media reports some types of things incorrectly doesn't mean that it does that for other types of things. And even if they are mistaken about that second class of things, it doesn't mean that they are wrong in this instance. "
SpygateHernandez,"If by ""women"" you mean ""filthy whores"" then yes"
SpygateHernandez,"I was considering creating a new username in honor of this glorious new era of football history: TuckGateSpynandez. 

Stay tuned. "
SpygateHernandez,"If I did it, here's how
- OJ Simpson"
SpygateHernandez,"My room to talk is that we have had a 16 game starter in my lifetime. 

I am 26 years old. "
SpygateHernandez,The Browns were decent at the beginning of the season but started to get back into their groove of suck as the season wore on. Classic. 
SpygateHernandez,Sure.
SpygateHernandez,I root for the Jets. 
SpygateHernandez,I just want to leave the world a better place than I found it. Mostly by insulting the Pats and the Browns
SpygateHernandez,"If by ""accused"" you mean ""proven to my satisfaction"" then yes. So has Cary Williams. "
SpygateHernandez,"You are truly pathetic, and I salute you. "
SpygateHernandez,The Herschel Walker trade was such a shit move that I'm surprised that the Browns weren't the team on the receiving end. 
SpygateHernandez,Longevity? 
SpygateHernandez,"Such an interesting rivalry. Both HoF players with very different styles. Both were also incredibly exciting but in very different ways. Ed Reed with the ball in his hands returning an INT was a thing of beauty. Troy Polamalu jumping a snap count and hurdling over the offensive line was equally amazing. 

It was a privilege to watch them both play at the same time. The way they contrasted really put things in perspective. "
SpygateHernandez,"3 TD, 0 INT, 358 passing yards, 80% completion rate

;) "
SpygateHernandez,Not making fools of ourselves. 
SpygateHernandez,"I have a gut feeling that the Giants are going to win their division behind a strong season by Eli. This is not based on homerism because I like all Jet fans deeply hate the Giants. But I have to go with my gut on this one. 

Eli was a lot better than people realize last year. It was probably the best regular season of his career. I also feel like he's going to lead a bunch of game-winning drives. 

Also, why the fuck isn't Patriots-Giants a primetime game? I hate both teams but c'mon you just know that one is going to be classic. "
SpygateHernandez,Stupid face too. 
SpygateHernandez,"Not now that he's old with a weak arm, but back in the day he aired it out plenty. "
SpygateHernandez,I actually think it's going to be the Giants. 
SpygateHernandez,"You have to admit that there are more holes than points of strength on the Chargers these days.

Of course, in his early days as a starter the Chargers were totally loaded. No disputing that. "
SpygateHernandez,Let's also just get this out in the open: Ben Roethlisberger is kind of fat. 
SpygateHernandez,"Oh I'm sorry, I forgot how Cleveland has won *anything* (sports or otherwise) in the past *50* years. "
SpygateHernandez,"Romo had better passing efficiency stats than Rodgers in literally every meaningful category (passer rating, ANY/A, Y/A). For Roethlisberger I guess I would say there hasn't been a specific year where he got shafted but he's never even really been a part of the conversation which is a load of crap because he's a great quarterback. For Rivers I would say he should have been MVP in 2008 (led the league in TDs, TD%, Y/A, ANY/A, *and* passer rating!) and although I think it should have been Brees in 2009 Rivers had a better case than Peyton that year. "
SpygateHernandez,I enjoyed this thoroughly. 
SpygateHernandez,Me too. No need to get too fancy or pedantic. 
SpygateHernandez,No.
SpygateHernandez,"But nobody has done it nearly this well, and you know it. "
SpygateHernandez,"The Raiders have no reason to change. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I wish the same could be said about their football team. "
SpygateHernandez,Basic standards of privacy must be compromised in the interest of bringing the Patriots down. 
SpygateHernandez,As do I! This is what football is all about!
SpygateHernandez,Deep down you find my irreverent dickishness and penchant for stirring the pot charming and you know it. 
SpygateHernandez,"""Clutch"" isn't somehow exclusive to  ""game manager."" I don't know why people think being a game manager is such a horrible insult. There isn't a great quarterback in history who was a poor game manager. "
SpygateHernandez,That wasn't my intention at all. Respect the meaning of words. 
SpygateHernandez,"I'm used to it. But it will end eventually. 

I mean, just mathematically, it *has* to at some point, right? RIGHT???"
SpygateHernandez,"McNally doesn't strike me as the shiniest coin in the fountain. He seems like a really fat idiot based on his text messages. I also assume that he's ugly. 

I also feel like I'm not the only one inferring these things. "
SpygateHernandez,That's basically what a 4-3 defense is in today's league. 
SpygateHernandez,Does JaMarcus Russell count?
SpygateHernandez,Cowboys and every NFC team that thinks the Cowboys are the Cowboys are their rivals.
SpygateHernandez,"RIP

God I love Eagles fans. They're so surly and angry. An example to us all. "
SpygateHernandez,If it was that simple a lot fewer GMs would get fired. 
SpygateHernandez,"He could be. Zimmer is a heck of a teacher. But it's best not to count your chickens before they hatch.

See ""Sanchez, Mark."" "
SpygateHernandez,You should try Kerrygold butter. It's the best thing I've ever tasted. 
SpygateHernandez,[A visual representation of what happened to the Pats](http://cdn.sting.com/pr/KevinMazur-Lyrics.jpg) (although this was even more beautiful.) 
SpygateHernandez,"My thoughts exactly. 

The Colts are still being run the way that a quarterback would run a team: lots of shiny ""weapons"" instead of meat-and-potatoes (defense and offensive line). "
SpygateHernandez,"6/14, 80 yards, 0 TD, 1 INT. 2.5 adjusted yards per attempt, 31.8 passer rating. 

Lovie Smith's defense put the team in positions to go ahead. "
SpygateHernandez,My guess is he likes the Eagles
SpygateHernandez,"I hate the fact that I am forced into a position where I have to root for the Giants every four years. 

I wish it was the Eagles who always beat the Pats. They're such surly bastards. "
SpygateHernandez,No. Frankly I would like to know who it is. 
SpygateHernandez,"He's probably using one weird trick to grow stronger and burn belly fat.

Doctors hate him. "
SpygateHernandez,Damned right. That band sucks major ass. 
SpygateHernandez,"Bake him away, toys."
SpygateHernandez,Oh for poop's sake... the season consisted of more than one fucking pass! And the Seahawks wouldn't have even been in the game if Wilson hadn't made a shit ton of great passes against one of the best pass defenses in the NFL. HE HAD A HIGHER PASSER RATING THAN BRADY!!!! ARGHHHHH! 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; bloodbath

I would use the term ""clusterfuck"" personally"
SpygateHernandez,"With logic like that, you could work for Ted Wells!"
SpygateHernandez,"Football is a very different sport from baseball or basketball. Careers are very, very short, and players don't have time to spare. Additionally, football produces many more injures that can derail careers than basketball or baseball.

It's also one of the reasons why the NFLPA is the weakest union in professional sports. If the players decided to strike, many (perhaps most) of them could easily be replaced when the new wave of college players comes into the league. They don't have any leverage. "
SpygateHernandez,"My implication was more that it's unpredictable than that it sucks. For all we know it could produce three 10+ win teams one year and be labeled ""the best division in the NFL"" and then produce an orgy of incompetence comparable to the Cleveland Browns the next. OK, maybe not *Browns* bad, but you catch my drift. "
SpygateHernandez,"The Pats go 0-4 with Brady out and the defensive backfield questionable, the Bills vacillate between bad Matt Cassel and bad EJ Manuel, Tannehill stumbles out of the gate and the Fins pass defense looks more like they did at the end of the year than the beginning, and Geno continues his consecutive streak of games with a perfect passer rating, which currently stands at 1. "
SpygateHernandez,"Even so I wouldn't necessarily choose that one. 

I would go [Saints @ 49ers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAxIGq9l2bg), 2011 Divisional Playoffs. Good versus evil. The greatest game of football that I have ever seen. "
SpygateHernandez,"Passer rating is the best (although you could make the case for ANY/A) as well. It accounts for not only TD% and INT%, but yards per attempt and completion % as well. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah a 98.6 career passer rating is really fucking scrubbin' it.
SpygateHernandez,"Stirring the pot is my MO. In any case, the cat is out of the bag. "
SpygateHernandez,"Don't listen to this pussy. You're right, that other guy is a pussy. In fact, everybody in here is a pussy but us. Let's fight all of them. "
SpygateHernandez,"Woah woah woah, lay off the Jags. It's not like they're the Browns or something. "
SpygateHernandez,Such a delicious conspiracy. 
SpygateHernandez,"In fairness, look at what happened to Brett Favre. Where do you think those leeks came from? "
SpygateHernandez,Who are you? I demand to know! So many people are ripping off my idea!
SpygateHernandez,How do we even know if Tom Brady is his real name? 
SpygateHernandez,"Based on everything I've heard from people who have encountered and interacted with him, he's supposed to be a pretty down-to-earth (which does *not* mean ""laid-back"") guy. 

It makes sense. His father (at least to my understanding) wasn't born wealthy. He didn't come from ""old money"" like the Bush family or something like that. "
SpygateHernandez,Yeah you do. Comment karma. 
SpygateHernandez,Well that certainly doesn't change my view. 
SpygateHernandez,They could have said the same thing about Dirk Nowitzki. 
SpygateHernandez,What a fucking BO$$. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Rodgers could have converted one of those. I say the coaching mattered a lot

Now you're living in the land of ""ifs"" and ""possiblys"" and confused it what the land of ""here's what happened."" They couldn't pass for dick that day and could barely run. Take the points, especially when you're ahead by *multiple* scores until the 4th quarter. All the McCarthy bashing is just hindsight based on how the game ultimately turned out. "
SpygateHernandez,I think you might be missing a numeral there. 
SpygateHernandez,"Thanks buddy! And please don't feel any obligation to defend Geno. He's no Teddy and we know it. Such is the life of a Jets fan. 

EDIT: Also we are mostly assholes. "
SpygateHernandez,You know you're desperate when you have to start going back to the days when the league was segregated. 
SpygateHernandez,"No offense, but this city would chew you up and spit you out. "
SpygateHernandez,"Not gonna lie, saying stuff like that makes him sound like a douchebag. "
SpygateHernandez,"Lettin' Jay and Emrey off the hook, eh?"
SpygateHernandez,Yeah they're fantastic! 
SpygateHernandez,These are strange times we live in. 
SpygateHernandez,Brees. And it's not just about stats. The way he's able to put the ball in the perfect spot for his receiver is amazing. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt;  at least he was out there trying.

Didn't those leaks indicate that he *wasn't* working hard enough in preparation, and that was exactly the problem?"
SpygateHernandez,*You* will never win a SB!
SpygateHernandez,Bear down!

SpygateHernandez,"I wish I had been around to watch John Elway cap off ""The Drive."" Or to see ""The Fumble."" Or ""Red Right 88."" Any of those would have been amazing. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah, the report's conclusion didn't say that Brady ordered the deflation by McNally beyond the shadow of a doubt, but it says that based on the circumstances that Wells examined, it was more probable than not that Brady was aware that people were doing inappropriate things with the footballs on his behalf, even if he didn't know exactly what they were doing or how they were doing it. "
SpygateHernandez,I would rather sound ridiculous and maintain my integrity than follow the herd and lose it. 
SpygateHernandez,Reality will burst that bubble soon. 
SpygateHernandez,No worries. I know the comment you are referring to now. 
SpygateHernandez,I guess it's the same reason why Rihanna chose Chris Brown... And the same reason she stayed with Chris Brown. 
SpygateHernandez,"Why make pennies on the dollar?

SpygateHernandez,"""Fitzpatricks"" (you want them to be good but deep down you know they suck)

""Facilitators"" (quarterbacks whose strength is making good decisions, even if they don't have the strongest arms in the world)

""Browns quarterbacks"" (hopelessly pathetic) "
SpygateHernandez,Either a corner or a defensive lineman. 
SpygateHernandez,I would have to say Miami because they'll have the best quarterback in the division. 
SpygateHernandez,"Eh, somebody is downvoting my main man. And I stand by my lolbrowns stance."
SpygateHernandez,"They both have their merits. Seattle has a fun defense to watch too. 

Basically, if you have a ton of talent, you will have a fun defense to watch as long as all the players understand what their roles are. "
SpygateHernandez,"The important thing to remember is that Tom Brady lied to America. 

In related news, I will soon be creating another account called ""TomBradyLied2America."" J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS"
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; Good decision maker.

I have a friend who was a FSU fan and said at the time that he didn't understand the pick because Ponder was *not* a good decision maker. According to him, he was terrible at finding the open man. "
SpygateHernandez,Marinovich was too mentally weak to function anywhere. 
SpygateHernandez,"When they go that badly, yes. "
SpygateHernandez,Fate has it out for you much worse than I do. I simply revel in your collective misery. 
SpygateHernandez,Jay Cutler. 
SpygateHernandez,"That one was a real shocker. The Vikings were a mess that year and the Eagles had an unstoppable incarnation of Mike Vick. 

But as they say, any given Tuesday."
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah I agree. I believe that at his heart of heart's he is still a douche and that the propaganda machine has tried to obscure this by tugging at people's heart strings, and that all of this is of course doesn't make him any better at football and he still sucks at it. "
SpygateHernandez,And **PARTY** AND **BULLSHIT** AND **PARTY**...
SpygateHernandez,"Hey, it all ended up working out, right?"

SpygateHernandez,I don't know if we can say that for sure. 
SpygateHernandez,That jacket = hall of fame blazer. 
SpygateHernandez,"The argument that Wilson wouldn't do well with the Colts just begs the question. If you assume Luck is better than it's true, but if you assume Wilson is better you can just say ""no they'd still be doing fantastic."" "
SpygateHernandez,"I disagree. I believe that you can win with any system as long as the players are talented, motivated, and on the same page. Dallas had a dramatically improved defense with Rod Marinelli coaching a straightup Tampa-2 last year. Chiacgo also fielded a dominant Tampa-2 before they got old recently. 

I agree that you need a lot of talent but that's pretty much true of any system. The problem with Minnesota's Tampa-2 was that Frazier was too soft on his players. "
SpygateHernandez,Romanowski was a straight up psychopath. 
SpygateHernandez,I appreciate the fact that Bill Polian hates the Patriots. 
SpygateHernandez,Classic Pats fan insecurity. The combination of the fact that you know that New York matters and Bean Town doesn't plus the fact that you know your Superbowls are built on a foundation of illegal tapes and doctored balls causes you to lash out at the Jets. SMH. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; snarky cockwaffle

Stealing this and passing it off as my own. "
SpygateHernandez,Brady for Geno Smith. 
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; I did always hate Childress though.

Everyone hated Childress, that guy had the charm of a rattlesnake. "
SpygateHernandez,"Ah, how could I forget about those games. The Hail Flacco! 

The Giants-Niners game had that muffed punt return by Kyle Williams, but it was about as close as that rule was going to get to having an effect out of those four. 

But one day that rule change will come into effect and when it does we'll be thankful as fans. "
SpygateHernandez,"I think you're confusing ""better team"" with ""better record last year."" 

As of 2015, the Jets are a better team than the Browns. The Jets aren't great, but even *if* they're worse, that doesn't mean that it isn't objectively accurate to say that the Browns suck ass. "
SpygateHernandez,All of the quarterbacks played like dick in that game and I'm not arguing otherwise. 
SpygateHernandez,Shitty thing is that in 99 out of 100 alternate universes that is exactly what happened. 
SpygateHernandez,"Specifically? Was there not video evidence of McNally taking the footballs into the bathroom? Did they then not drop below the legal PSI limit during halftime? Did Brady not claim to not know who McNally was?

Perhaps you are only accepting it because you love the Patriots. It's about evidence."
SpygateHernandez,Ben is in much worse shape than Brady and he clearly doesn't take care of himself nearly as well. 
SpygateHernandez,Wilson simply does not get enough credit. 
SpygateHernandez,"I, on the other hand, am from New York. "
SpygateHernandez,Apparently Cleveland thought it did. Or that it would at least sell jerseys. 
SpygateHernandez,They said he was raw during the draft process so the fact that he's a liability in coverage doesn't surprise me. He's still learning the position. Rushing the passer is very instinctive and translates very well from the college game. But coverage is much more of a thinking man's game. It takes time before you get to the point where the coach is nervous about putting you out there. 
SpygateHernandez,"I have a funny feeling that messing with Tom Brady will be the last mistake Roger Goodell ever makes as commissioner. 

Then again, he seems to make a lot of mistakes, so don't hold me to that. "
SpygateHernandez,"As LeSean McCoy has pointed out, Chip Kelly's *real* strategy is to get rid of all the black players. "
SpygateHernandez,"But the delicious irony was that they were no longer the Browns, because the football Gods hate Cleveland, so they gave them the ultimate middle-finger by moving the team to Baltimore and then guiding them to two Superbowls! AS NOT THE BROWNS!"
SpygateHernandez,It's true. They're the worst kind of people. 
SpygateHernandez,"On another topic, I understand there's a huge drinking culture in the Lake Superior area. "
SpygateHernandez,He's the douche with the face fans love to hate. 
SpygateHernandez,"That was a different era. Martin played in the 90s and early 2000s, which were way, way more feature-back focused than the later 2000s and early 2010s. "
SpygateHernandez,"I really want to know why we're not hearing from McNally &amp; Jastremski in all of this. The Pats may have a confidentiality agreement with them, but if they would only say things that would bolster their (they Pats/Brady's) case, why aren't they making them available for comment? If both of them said publicly ""we never illegally deflated any footballs and Brady never asked us to"" it would do wonders for the Pats' PR. "
SpygateHernandez,"It wouldn't have even mattered if the Packers had capitalized on Seattle's early turnovers. The Packers defense and running game kept them in that one, and Packer fans aren't going to want to hear this but so did their coaching. Rodgers couldn't pass the ball for dick in that game, his defense just managed to make Wilson totally unable to pass for dick as well. "
SpygateHernandez,I don't understand why the Saints passed up on drafting Lawrence Taylor. 
SpygateHernandez,It's my swarthy Latin charm. 
SpygateHernandez,"I agree, that movie was shit. Fucking Goodell had it released to give us plebes a hit from the crackpipe in the dark depths of the offseason. 

Honestly, the idea that it was the *Browns* that would end up handling the draft well is completely implausible on its face. It contradicts the entire modern history of the NFL. And then Kevin Costner finds out that he fucking got Jennifer Garner PREGNANT *ON* DRAFT DAY? Weeping Jesus on the Cross, what a load of implausible shit. AND THEN the movie is filled with completely implausible Hollywood dialogue like ""I want my second round pick that I traded to you *back*. Why? Because I *goddamned* feel like it, that's why."" Literally no general manager in the history of professional sports has ever said anything remotely like that. What a fucking crock.  "
SpygateHernandez,**TL;DR** Best NFL team of the 70s. 
SpygateHernandez,Such poor taste. I love it. 
SpygateHernandez,What other bands did he like?
SpygateHernandez,"They'll work for Cam, who doesn't have the cleanest mechanics in the world. He's a good quarterback but at this point he still needs big receivers to bail him out of inaccurate throws. 

It's kind of frustrating to watch him play because if he improved those mechanics man oh man would he dominate. But right now I'm kind of afraid that he's on the Jay Cutler path."
SpygateHernandez,"This sucks. I normally relish making fun of the Browns but this was a fantastic pick. 

What kind of Bizarro-world is this?"
SpygateHernandez,"Two examples come to mind recently:

1) Aaron Rodgers at Buffalo this past season (and please don't give me the argument that Jordy Nelson dropped that wide open pass, because he also broke up a surefire pick-six earlier that game. Rodgers authored one of the finest seasons of passing that we've ever seen in 2014, but that game really sticks out like a sore thumb. 

2) Coby Fleener dropping that wide open pass from Luck (against Washington IIRC). He's a very good tight end, you usually don't see those kinds of mistakes from him. "
SpygateHernandez,"I actually hope the Chargers win the AFC West but I just don't think the talent is there to match up with Denver man for man. 

Rivers is still as good as he ever was (pending health) and I do think that the secondary is very good. Flowers and Weddle are two of the tops at their position. And those are the two most important elements to a successful team, besides maybe pass rush (which is a really big concern IMO). I imagine the o-line will be better this year because they just can't possibly have *that* many injures again, although I feel like they are going to have half as many, which is still a fuckton. Gates is still good and Gordon should solidify the running game and take some pressure off Rivers (lord knows he needs it). But sadly, I still see a lot more holes than strong points on the Chargers. 

As your old saying goes, though: In Rivers We Trust. "

SpygateHernandez,And a glorious day 'twas. 
SpygateHernandez,"Last year the Jets sucked a bag of dicks, but we *have* managed to win a division title in the past quarter century. Not every franchise can say that. 

And by ""not every franchise"" I am specifically referring to the Browns. "
SpygateHernandez,"I know, now I know what Sam Bradford's knee feels like!"
SpygateHernandez,Basically. Stats vs. Rings. 
SpygateHernandez,And nothing worth saying with any of them. 
SpygateHernandez,"Yes, the Cleveland Browns' front office is clearly confused about how to find a quarterback. "
SpygateHernandez,I like how you quote me pointing out that Goodell had the evidence destroyed and yet you completely abandon talking about that point. There's a reason why Patriots fans are so sensitive about this stuff. Probably made worse by the fact that their quarterback is a liar. 
SpygateHernandez,Don't humor them. We both know that the Browns suck even worse than we do. And we have a good excuse (Tom Brady*) for we we generally suck (although the Jets have made the playoffs in the past decade)
SpygateHernandez,I know! I can't believe we got rid of racial segregation! Fucking bleeding heart liberals 
SpygateHernandez,"The one that passes the ball better more often is the better quarterback, and since they both played the quarterback position, the one who was the better quarterback was the better football player. "
SpygateHernandez,"- 2010 Divisional Playoffs: Jets 28, Patriots 21. 

- Oakland with JaWalrus Russell beating the Eagles during the 2009 season also comes to mind. 

- The Chiefs shutting down the Packers in 2011. "
SpygateHernandez,"""Browns"""

Clearly you are not familiar with the ""Jet Way"""
SpygateHernandez,"Surprising, since Minnesota had a damned good Tampa-2 system for a while there. "
SpygateHernandez,"Aw shucks.

Also, I like what you're doing with your username. Trolls unite!"
SpygateHernandez,Yeah I did hear that but the idea that the Browns would do something right makes the movie implausible off the bat. 
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah, IIRC Goodell appointed Tagliabeau (sp) to be the independent arbitrator in that case, and while he upheld the suspension of the coaches and staff members involved he let the players off the hook. 

Personally I think Tagliabeau (again sp) was a much better commish for the NFL than Goodell because he had a knack for being able to keep the peace. Although ironically most NFL fans outside of Louisiana thought that the Bountygate punishments were appropriate. "
SpygateHernandez,He's a beast and people who follow the NFL know it.
SpygateHernandez,"IMO coaches focus too much on physical tools and not enough on mental ones and attitude. Coaches are frequently arrogant enough to think that they can take a great physical specimen and program them to be a great decision maker. That very, very rarely happens. "
SpygateHernandez,"My my, listen to how you got your panties into a twist. And all while trying to justify spying (videotaped or not) that you appear to be admitting took place. 

When you get somebody to throw a ballistic temper tantrum like you just did, it means you've hit a sensitive spot. "
SpygateHernandez,"For whatever reason they're hypersensitive about any criticism of Rodgers. They're not like Colts fans who just accept Peyton's many failures at this point. Of course they've gotten sensitive about Luck but whatever. 

The point is that the Cleveland Browns have been a horrible, horrible franchise for the past 15 years. "
SpygateHernandez,"It is a day that ends in the letter ""y"" so yes. "
SpygateHernandez,You are both correct. 
SpygateHernandez,What I wouldn't give for Wilfork to have not elevated that lineman and Sanchez to have run harmlessly into his back. 
SpygateHernandez,"The best players gravitate towards the NFL because they can make a lot more money there. 

IIRC the current salary cap for a CFL team is something like $5 million per year. That's what you'd pay a decent starter in the NFL. As a result, the most talented players go to where they can make the most money, and that means that there are very rarely (although not never) NFL-caliber players in the CFL. "
SpygateHernandez,"I just realized a great, cosmic irony: 

for the first time since Joe Namath roamed the Earth, Jets fans would not have booed a draft. And it was held in Chicago. 

Well played, Goodell, well played. "
SpygateHernandez,"Revis for sure, Richardson if he keeps it up. "
SpygateHernandez,I have been counter-zinged and I love it!
SpygateHernandez,"1) Rosters ebb and flow. Hardluck teams like the Browns are rare. The fact that you end up with a good roster doesn't mean you're a genius for getting it to that point or that you can expect to continue on that path in the future. Again, Jeff Fisher is the best example. His  teams started out blah, and had a dominant period and then became blah again. Stick around long enough and you'll end up with talent one way or the other. Garrett also deserves no credit for Romo, who was already an underappreciated stud long before he got there. 

2) Belichick *did* luck into Brady because the Patriots (including the GM who drafted him, who was *not* Belichick) had no fucking clue that he would become a fraction of a fraction of what he has become. If you watch the Brady 6 documentary, Patriots personnel who were involved with that draft said they thought that he could potentially become a solid starter with a couple years of work. If the Patriots knew (or even suspected) that he would become one tenth of what he is, they would have traded away their whole draft to nab him as early as possible in order to ensure that nobody else would take him. The sixth round is where you takes fliers on Tyler Thigpens and AJ Feelys', not where you draft the future of your franchise. "
SpygateHernandez,"I would agree, but that's why I would say passer rating (which also takes completion % and yards per attempt into account) is the best stat for passing performance. 

In terms of the AP article, IIRC the league average for 8-man fronts was about 25%, so basically having a generational back at this point gets you 1/3 as opposed to 1/4. For that reason, I don't think having a better rushing attack effects passing performance that much. But there is absolutely more to it than TD and INT percentages. "
SpygateHernandez,Don't forget not picking up Orton while they had the chance!
SpygateHernandez,THAT SON OF A BITCH!
SpygateHernandez,"Sometimes if there's a notable offensive tackle or 3-4 lineman I will watch them, especially if I go back and watch a game again for nostalgia purposes. "
SpygateHernandez,"All I can say is that if the ""lack of talent"" explanation is what held Bortles back, it really went the full nine yards. Carr and Bridgewater suffered similar problems. Bridgewater had an especially bad line. Matt Kalil was possibly the worst tackle in the NFL for most of the season. 

Manziel was the kind of player who could succeed in college but at this point is too far behind the curve for the NFL. He can't read defenses and he can't go through progressions the way a quarterback has to if he wants to be even remotely successful. Even if his ego gets in check and his work ethic does a complete 180, it's just too late at this point. 

I won't even dignify Garpoopolo with a response. 

This is a two-horse race. "
SpygateHernandez,TED WELLS FOR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE!!!!
SpygateHernandez,Frankly it was a gamble that paid off. 
SpygateHernandez,"Heh heh heh, what a jackass with that fedora!"
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah, he would have destroyed the evidence because it didn't contain anything incriminating. "
SpygateHernandez,But it wasn't! It was totally appropriate for those circumstances! 
SpygateHernandez,You of all people should know that I started this whole thing and a bunch of people have been blatantly ripping me off!
SpygateHernandez,"Dude, you resorted to saying that the Browns *won their division* in fucking *1989*. The Jets are pathetic as shit because we haven't won our division since *2002*. And that fucking sucks. But we have won our division *within the past quarter-century*. And we also have a pretty good excuse for why we never win our division (rhymes with ""Dom Drady"").

SpygateHernandez,Oh please. 
SpygateHernandez,"It would be an ad hominem if I said that your point was invalid because of the fact that you're a Pats fan, but that's completely incidental to the crap argument you presented. 

I'm still missing the part where Belichick was able to get his players to check Rams plays that they had never run without untoward intel about them. Maybe you destroyed it like Goodell destroyed the Spygate evidence. "
SpygateHernandez,Aw shucks ;) 
SpygateHernandez,"I really admired the way the Buccaneers were put together by Tony Dungy and the way the Bears were put together under Lovie Smith. Lots of basic cover-2 with a little cover-3 thrown in, minimal blitzing, incredible zone coverage, smart and physical play. "
SpygateHernandez,The defense played plenty well. 
SpygateHernandez,Got vids?
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; I mean, Wells has already lied.. He said the Pats didn't make McNally available, they made him available for 5 appointments.

Important distinction here: he was only available *to Ted Wells* once. The other three interviews were with NFL security. He was never made available for a second interview *with Ted Wells.* That's not even close to a lie. 

&gt; It's not unprecedented whatsoever. Goodell never had to give up his phone in the Mueller investigation. Why should Brady?

The fact that Goodell didn't turn over his phone in the Mueller investigation doesn't make it less likely that Brady is hiding something about Deflategate. It makes it suggests Goodell *was* hiding something to the Mueller investigation. That's a separate issue. It's bad for both guys in both cases. 

&gt;Even if Brady's camp thinks Wells is independent, and he's innocent, there is still no benefit.

There would be a huge benefit. Wells would look at the records in the phone and conclude that there was no evidence that he directly or indirectly told anyone to tamper with the footballs in an inappropriate manner. Best case scenario, the independent investigator says ""he's free and clear because there's no evidence of tampering on his phone,"" worst case scenario the biased boogie man investigator begrudgingly says ""we were unable to recover any communications related to deflation of footballs on Mr. Brady's phone, however look at all this other circumstantial evidence."" If Brady is indeed innocent, it would have been a *huge* benefit to hand over his phone and give the opportunity to Wells to mine it for direct evidence. If Wells came up short, it would be a powerful argument in Brady's favor. The fact that he didn't give Wells access to it suggests that he has something to hide -- it might not be a text.  "
SpygateHernandez,"It was fucking sick man. He was soooooooooooo good. Easily the highlight of a shitty game.

I mean, that Superbowl was so bad that *Peyton Manning* won it. Let that sink in. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; It's ad hominem if you try to devalue my argument by devaluing my character, which is exactly what you just tried to do.

No it isn't. It's ad hominem to say that your *conclusion* is wrong because of your character or identity. My point is instead that it is not surprising that a member of the same fanbase that is currently bending over backwards to convince itself that ""deflator"" is a weight loss term would also buy into other Patriots apologetics, however convoluted. 

&gt;That doesn't surprise me in the least because you're a fucking moron. Let me point it out to you, again from your own source which you clearly did not read:
""And your source explains that there was a conversation between one of the film crew members who was present for the Rams walk through and Brian Daboll, then Patriots assistant. That is explicitly stated as not against the rules.""

Let me get this clear: are you saying that the film crew watched the Rams practice and then relayed what they saw to a Patriots assistant? Oh my, what a difference that makes! It's not spying if you don't have it on tape! 

I guess writing ""Saturday"" in place of ""Friday"" is sufficient for you to conclude that I have been ""making things up at every turn"" because you cannot bare the fact that the Patriots have a tainted legacy in the eyes of everyone who isn't a Pats-zombie and in the eyes of the players they competed against. Latch onto whatever you can to attack me, but the truth is what it is, and the truth is that the Patriots are a dirty team. "

SpygateHernandez,"Which I think is completely plausible for the Vikings, but I don't believe in counting chickens before they hatch. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yeah he's meant to be a magnate for criticism that constantly gets bad press. 

All I'm saying is this kind of shit never happened with Paul Taglieabeau. Players didn't universally despise him. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; What's irrational is someone assuming their team is better than another team before the season starts.

Not at all. We all make assumptions about what teams will be successful based on the evidence we have available to us before the season starts. I assume the Seahawks will be good and the Bears will be bad. I assume the Packers will be good and the Redskins will be bad. It's perfectly reasonable, and although sometimes those assumptions are wrong, they're also *right* a significant amount of the time, probably the majority of the time. 

&gt;Browns found a way to be decent without a good QB. The jets however have not yet. You being a condescending person doesn't help your argument. Just makes it funnier that you try so hard.

And then they fucked it up in typical fashion. Of course, my *attitude* has nothing do to with the *substance* of my argument, but I guess that's a distinction you can't be expected to understand. 

&gt;And aww down voting me? How adorable you think imaginary internet points mean something. :)

It's not me. Now *that's* an unjustified assumption! "
SpygateHernandez,It's the same reason we gawk at car crashes on the freeway. 
SpygateHernandez,"Intentional or not, you're not allowed to have hi-lo hits on a quarterback. As far as the turnover is concerned, as I recall he threw a pick to Jonathan Vilma as a result of that hit because he was trying to get rid of the ball and couldn't have thrown it out of bounds because he was within the tackle box (again, this is based off memory so I could be mistaken). My understanding is that a turnover off an illegal hit like that should have been wiped out, and Minnesota should have gotten a 15-yard roughing the passer call. That hit was very clear, and while I've heard Saints fans defend the other questionable hits in that game nobody has really tried to defend that one. The ref even said after the fact that it was a missed call. 

But what really got me was the final drive that ended that game. There were just some really bad calls that went in the Saints' favor on that drive. "
SpygateHernandez,Why don't you flip it over?

SpygateHernandez,"The rule of thumb is that any day that ends with a ""y"" is ShitOnBrowns day."
SpygateHernandez,"You can account for that with a stat called Rate+ (which you can find on Pro Football Reference) which adjusts the average passer rating for the season and indexes it at 100 then compares a player's passer rating to that index. 

I don't know if that explanation made sense, but for example if an average passer rating in a season was 80 and a quarterback had a rating of 88 then their Rate+ would be 110, because 80 would be indexed to 100. "
SpygateHernandez,"But Rodgers *did* essentially fall into their laps. Ted Thompson even wanted to trade the pick because Rodgers had come off very poorly personality-wise in the pre-draft process (he's toned it down a lot despite still being pretty fucking cocky since then but watch an interview with him before the draft, his ego was the size of a fucking blimp.) "
SpygateHernandez,"That's the best you've got? 

Brady is a liiiiiar, nah nah nah nah nah nah!"
SpygateHernandez,"I don't necessarily know about that. Gore was rarely (if ever) the best running back in the NFL, but he has such an extensive body of work that it can make up for it. My team's very own Curtis Martin, who had a career that I think is in many ways analogous to Gore's, only led the NFL in rushing once. "

SpygateHernandez,"Attempts do not matter. *Quality* matters (assuming you get beyond a minimum threshold of some kind to make sure that you're not a fluke.) The better passer isn't the person who passes it *more* it's the one who passes it *better*. 

Murray had a lot of attempts but I have never seen any actual *evidence* that a superior running game (and what did Murray's # of attempts look like compared to Lacy's? How about YPC?) actually improves passing efficiency. If you want to argue that it does that's fine but please give me something more than ""it's common sense."" "
SpygateHernandez,Youtube. 
SpygateHernandez,'Tis not for the faint of heart. 
SpygateHernandez,"I don't think the 3-4 vs. 4-3 distinction makes that big of a difference, but I prefer to see straight up nasty 4-3 defenses with simple schemes like they have in Buffalo and Seattle. It's those kinds of defenses that can actually shut down elite quarterbacks. You're not going to outsmart Brady, Manning, Rodgers, or Brees, you just got to beat the living shit out of their offense. "
SpygateHernandez,"That was a horrible comeback. You've gotta fire back with something original instead of just saying ""I know you are but what am I?"" 

"
SpygateHernandez,"That's basically what the debate comes down to. Bradshaw was one of the best ever in the playoffs but there is no contest that over the course of a season, Tarkenton would perform better overall. "
SpygateHernandez,"Tape asterisk? 

That's the way to go. The world needs to know: drop one pound of air pressure from a urethane bladder and suddenly you go from zero to the next incarnation of Joe Montana.

SpygateHernandez,I completely trust Scots when it comes to lawncare. 
SpygateHernandez,Is there any evidence that the volume of passes (all things being equal) effects passing efficiency? And what is the evidence that a strong running game actually helps passing efficiency? People always say that but I have yet to hear any actual empirical evidence to that effect. 
SpygateHernandez,I don't know which is harder to take seriously: the plot and dialogue in that movie or the idea that Goodell didn't know about the Ray Rice video.

SpygateHernandez,"Certainly true, but Tarkenton played with a better line in front of him. One HoFer in Ron Yary, and another great player (I forget if he's in the Hall but he should be) in his center Mick Tinglehoff. 

Bradshaw played with Mike Webster but that's pretty much it for his offensive line. "

SpygateHernandez,"I actually didn't know about that one, which is surprising because "" 'new england patriots' + 'cheating'"" is one of my most heavily googled items. 

I wouldn't put it past them though. Belichick knows his military strategy, and he knows that getting an advantage in CCCI (command, communications, something beginning with a 'c' which I  forget, and intelligence) are huge keys to defeating your opponents. "
SpygateHernandez,We should take witty back and forth banter like this on the road!
SpygateHernandez,"STRENGTHS: Hard hitter. Amazing in coverage. Ferocious team leader with a huge heart. Plays in the secondary, but with the mentality of a linebacker. Willing to play through injury, even if it means amputating a limb. 

WEAKNESSES: There is only one of him. "
SpygateHernandez,"I think you've confused ""delusion"" with ""realism."""
SpygateHernandez,"Probably not, but I'm not sure how much better they are, if at all. 

Rodgers played with the best line in the NFCN and two excellent skill position players in Nelson and Lacy himself. His receiver corps was also much better than Romo's all around -- his star might not have been as shiny, but he had depth, which is what matters. He was not single-handedly keeping a crappy team relevant in the way Rivers has for several years at this point. Romo has also kept a bunch of crappy Cowboys teams in the hunt because he's a just plain fantastic passer.

And to say that it's ""rather easy"" to rack up the best efficiency stats in the league even when you play under favorable circumstances is just plain incorrect. It might make it *easier* but it is by no means easy. "
SpygateHernandez,"Romo is *way* more prominent than Ken Anderson. People are going to remember Tony Romo because there's more attention on the game today and because he plays for a much, much bigger market team. 

Anderson is going to remain NFL history's best kept secret, and Romo isn't simply because he's a much more high-profile player. 

That's an intriguing comparison statistically. When you dig into it and account for era, though, Anderson is in my view pretty clearly the winner:

- three time NFL leader in completion percentage (66-70% in an era where completion percentages were much lower)
- two time leader in yards
- One time leader in touchdown percentage and three time leader in lowest interception percentage 
- Two time leader in yards per attempt and yards per game
- FOUR time leader in passer rating! (for the sake of comparison, Peyton has led the NFL in passer rating *three* times despite a longer career)
- Seriously, look him up, he was *really* fucking good

Romo, on the other hand, really only has this year to his credit, where he led the league in passer rating, completion percentage, yards per attempt, and touchdown percentage. That's fantastic, but it doesn't stack up to Anderson's consistency. 

Additionally, Anderson was also an important figure in the history of the game, because (along with Montana) he was the original West Coast offense quarterback. And he was masterful at it. Just look up the Superbowl where Anderson's Bengals played Montana's Niners. Their passing performances were beautiful. 

Simply put, I don't think there can ever be another Ken Anderson, because anyone that good would be a superstar no matter what market they played in today. I actually think Rivers might be a better statistical comparison, but even his accomplishments aren't as extensive as Anderson's. 

EDIT: Words, plus an afterthought.

SpygateHernandez,"ITT: A lot of people are saying ""NFL revenues have skyrocketed since Goodell took the reigns, so he deserves credit."" That's just post hoc ergo prompter hoc. The NFL has gotten more popular, but how has *he* been responsible for that? IMO it's more of a ""right place in the right time"" type of situation. "

SpygateHernandez,"The ""eye test"" is completely subjective. We may argue about which statistics are meaningful or important (although it really comes down to passer rating and ANY/A) but whatever statistics we decide upon are what they are. No such luck with the ""eye test."" They eye test is about your feelings rather than the facts. And it's about the overall impression that watching a player leaves you with, because there's no way you can keep track of every snap they play. "
SpygateHernandez,"Take those yellow and gold glasses off and see the world in its true colors my friend. Tarkenton cantankerous as fuck and it's awesome. He hates RGIII so much. It is truly a thing of beauty. He just fucking tells it like it is 24/7, gloves off. "
SpygateHernandez,"Because he plays for a small market team that's been mediocre-to-bad during the whole of his tenure there.

Marino played with a ton of great teams. And all for naught. "
SpygateHernandez,"Don't get me wrong, I love watching the Browns organization as well. Everybody loves a clown! 

Also you forgot that the Knicks also suck. "
SpygateHernandez,"I didn't include TDs or INTs because they don't tell you anything by themselves. Passer rating and ANY/A (and to some extent completion percentage) are what you want to look at, because they measure not just the quantity of passes a player throws but the quality of their throws. And Tarkenton still kills Bradshaw in those categories despite playing with less all-around offensive talent. "
SpygateHernandez,"Yes, oh God yes!"
SpygateHernandez,"No don't you get it, all scandals are equal!"
SpygateHernandez,"Oh no my team sucks fair and square. 

Spygate was ostensibly about Blichick blatantly ignoring videotaping regulations even after the league sent out a memo effectively telling him to knock it off. Of course, we'll never know the *real* story because [Goodell had the evidence destroyed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye1Iyz7vVbs) But we *do* know that before the Superbowl against the Rams, St. Louis had a series of new plays put in specifically for that game and the Patriots (whose film crew was mysteriously spotted setting up cameras at the Rams walk through the Saturday before the game) that they had never run before, [and the Patriots *amazingly* happened to call the perfect check before every play.](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/marshall-faulk-brings-spygate-ll-never-over-being-182812366--nfl.html)

SpygateHernandez,"I've been on the Anderson bandwagon for years at this point. I just don't get how a guy who was so fucking good can be a fairly obscure figure to even fans who are pretty familiar with NFL history. 

I mean,*Phil Simms* is better known than Anderson. That's just an insult. 

EDIT: Now that I think about it I know why. His teams generally weren't very good, and he was (surprisingly) only 10 games over .500 as a starter. He was also injured a lot. "
SpygateHernandez,"Interesting question. I wonder how the fact that players will inevitably play games in both right to work and non-right to work states factors into this. I know that players' game checks are taxed based on where the game takes place (if you play for a CA team and play a game in Florida where there is no state income tax, you don't pay a state income tax on that game check) and I wonder if a similar principle could apply in this case. "
SpygateHernandez,"Roethlisberger and Rivers are the two most underappreciated players of our time. Probably Romo too. 

All damned fine quarterbacks. And let me say this: Dick LeBeau's defense wouldn't have nearly the sterling reputation it has acquired if it wasn't for the fact that Roethlisberger is a master of game winning drives and comebacks. "

SpygateHernandez,"They were kind of a Cinderella story because their initial starter (Trent Green) went down and Kurt Warner came out of nowhere and won MVP in his first season as a starter. It was really amazing. I would say that basically everyone liked them a lot. On top of that, they had a really fun offense to watch (and their defense was highly underrated as well.) On top of that they had a great playoff run that included an awesome shootout with the Vikings, a knuckle-whitening slugfest with the Buccaneers, and of course one of the best Superbowls of all time against Tennessee. That was really the 1999 Rams. I don't feel like they were good for long enough for people to hate them like the Patriots. "

SpygateHernandez,"&gt; the idea of building a team based on balls

I can think of one team that built itself on deflated balls. "
SpygateHernandez,"&gt; They didn't test more because apparently it was a time issue. But then a ball boy who spent 90s in a bathroom deflated 11 of them near perfectly? ... Funny how months ago this subreddit laughed at that as 'evidence' and all said it's pretty clear he just took a piss and maybe checked his phone

I wholly admit that I don't buy the NFL's narrative on this part of it. It was clearly a sting operation, and if McNally can deflate 11 balls in 90 seconds, the refs can gauge the pressure of the Colts balls in an equivalent amount of time. If the ""integrity of the game"" is really and issue, you can delay the Colts ass-whoppin' (AKA second half) by 90 seconds. No argument from me there, it was a sting, but that part is immaterial to the issue at hand, which is whether Brady had the balls deflated in a manner that was clearly illegal. 

&gt;Brady did absolutely lie about knowing who the ball boy was. But that's not evidence he asked them to do anything illegal. Perhaps he just didn't want to be linked to them in case they did something without his knowledge. 

Why would Brady lie about such an easy thing to disprove though? It just doesn't add up if he didn't ask him to do anything illegal. 

&gt;The Colts balls weren't all tested but depending on the gauge 3/4 were under the legal limits too. They didn't test more because apparently it was a time issue. But then a ball boy who spent 90s in a bathroom deflated 11 of them near perfectly?

My understanding, though, was that the Colts' Balls dropped (tee hee hee) by a significantly lesser amount than the Patriots balls. "
SpygateHernandez,"How about you actually win a championship before you start getting on your high horse there, buddy. "
SpygateHernandez,"Did the NFLPA even have a ""likeness licensing"" agreement back then? Video games were still very new technology, and the idea of associating them with real-life sports stars was relatively new as well."
SpygateHernandez,"1. Goodell gives Brady a 4 game suspension, reduced to 2 upon appeal. Belichick doesn't receive any punishment at all because unlike Bountygate, deflation isn't a team-wide conspiracy that he could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of. 

2. The Patriots get their asses kicked in their first two games. They lack confidence with Garoppolo under center. 

3. The Dolphins jump out to an early lead and don't give it back, even after the return of Brady, going 12-4.

5. Jets finish 8-8."

SpygateHernandez,"I personally disagree that it was outdated per se. The problem was that it those teams lacked talent in the secondary. A dominant defensive line can only do so much. Eventually you need corners. 

The Tampa-2 is still a very viable scheme and I expect Tampa to start demonstrating that in the near future. I personally even think its a good idea because it's easy for young players to learn. You're not going to fool Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning, or Tom Brady with an exotic scheme anyway, you just need to beat 'em up. "

adv0589,"Titans to the Media, to be clear those previous claims were absurd but still im sure Mett actually believed them "
adv0589,"hahahahahahhahaha, I will apologize for being a dick in the original comment because I guess I see where you were confused although I still don't understand the premise of not being able to respond .

But it's probably time to just admit you confused me with someone else instead of playing the ""I am way too cool for this shit"" and the I am too smart for you card. "
adv0589,"zero chance we do it, not even worth discussing, chip would die before that was allowed "
adv0589,Fairly signed for less then 5m there is no way you get a 3rd. 
adv0589,"We are not eligible to be forced, you would literally get the patriots to volunteer before the Eagles.

And to be clear when it comes to ""forcing"" they kinda hope a team just sucks it up and does it, the eagles would turn it into a pr nightmare and blame it if the season went wrong. 

Hard Knocks has to balance being bad in the fans minds as well "
adv0589,"&gt; Wouldn't Terrelle fit his system perfectly?

wat"
adv0589,"Ok first off i think the premise of not being able to talk about what teams got is kinda absurd. 

But this is pretty hilarious 
&gt;Trading up for Morris Claiborne was pure brilliance. He's a lockdown cornerback who will instantly make their defense better.

&gt;Claiborne and Brandon Carr will be a dangerous one-two punch."
adv0589,"I mean this was a pretty obvious pick until he met with jones like 4 times in 3 weeks. 

But he did nail it "
adv0589,Possibly the worst offense in the NFL with a non top 20 QB for a WR is your choice lol
adv0589,"I mean to be clear here guys they don't mean 20 something football fans or current students. He means the average FSU alum 30-60 who doesn't live and die by the football success. 

Whether this is a thing or not is up for debate but I don't think you guys are talking about the same alum "
adv0589,"From what I understand it is a massive code and things like ""drops"" on the same play as an interception, or the context of a play are viewed by some algorithm. For example there isn't some guy going ok jack up the clutch factor on this play but a extra weight added or subtracted from say a TD pass to tie the game within 5 minutes or a TD pass up 24 with 5 to go.  "
adv0589,Yeah assumed this was a Mariota related question so was going for those type of offenses but he is definitely an example of a nontraditional offense's QB transitioning well. 
adv0589,right side control f flair if you cant find it 
adv0589,Only someone who didn't see the magic show one would say this is  the weirdest. 
adv0589,"You guys don't have a weakness. Like unrelated note but if he wants to be part of a great line Id say Philly or Cleveland who have similar talent across the line but one glaring open spot are better fits overall.

As you said unlike the other few best lines you have 2 above average players as the 2 worst players on the line rather then 4 great 1 spot missing. Its not like Collins would not be a great asset but at least for the next year or two he might not even be a starter or an upgrade over who would have been there.

Collins has turned from like the 3-5th best OL prospect who might be better off at G into some future superstar over the last week and a half. "
adv0589,On a side note Dick Fein probably had quite the rough childhood with that name 
adv0589,"We won 10 games with Mark Sanchez starting over half the season, and McCoy was terrible last year. 

At some point you have to realize that just because they are new does not mean that they automatically will not be able to replicate their production.. 

We are at worst pickems in every game til week 8 the road Dallas game, Arizona Patriots and Detriot are all in the later half of the season. The Eagles COULD easily be a 5-2 to 7-0 team over the period they adjust that you refer to. 
"
adv0589,"No way IMO, only reason their team was there in the first place was a incredibly weak schedule. AFCS NFCS and last place teams is absurdly easy. 

I have the Browns as a top 5 pick contender with maybe 8-8 upside. "
adv0589,I mean how low is this guys opinion of himself if he thinks he was going in the teens and wont be able to stick in the league for 3 years
adv0589,Yeah they just held atlanta GB and NE to 13.5 ppg no big deal
adv0589,"Probably '09 wildcard game to break the Cowboys playoff streak. 

Had far bigger losses in my time of fandom and '08 NFCCG was RIGHT there but i started watching right before the Eagles were in the NFCCG every year so even though they hurt I didn't fully appreciate that that run will probably never happen again in my lifetime at the point. "
adv0589,Just as it is with the Jets on DL you can't just ignore that they only have 3 positions to fill instead of 4. Easily the #1 4-3 but there are 3-4 defenses like the Chiefs and Broncos who have 3 equally talented  players compared to the Panthers. 
adv0589,"Year by year. 

2006 Fumbled a snap as the holder for the game winning FG as time expired, only got 190 yards in  the game as a QB.

2007 201 yards 1 td 1 int 64 QB rating as the #1 seed at hom

2008 Win an you are in week 17 game 3 turnovers 0 touchdowns in a 44-6 loss, also would have clinched the week before butt had a terrible game in week 16 as well along with a week 14 1 td 3 int game that they lost by 7.

2009 his first playoff win, solid game 2 TDs 250 yards in a easy game. 

Goes into Minnesota the next week 190 yards 0 tds 1 int 66 QB rating while the team scores 3 total points.

2010 Injured did not play end of season

2011 Decent stat line in winner take all NFCE matchup, however the team only scored 14 points. 

2012 3 interceptions only 220 yards in a winner take all NFCE game.

2013 was out for season week 17.

2014 Both games were good by him 1 win 1 loss. 

.

So break that down.

 He has won 2 playoff games, he played very well in both of them (2009,2014) take those out. 2 total

He has lost 1 playoff style game where he played very well. 2014 Div, 15/19 191 yrd 2 TD 140 QB. 1 total

He has 2011, where he had a decent line but team only scored 14 points, I GUESS we can call that neutral. 1 total

Then we have games where he directly played poorly or directly cost his team the win, the 2006 fumble under 200 yards, 2007 loss as 1 seed 200 yards 1 td 1 int 60 qb rating, 2008 3 turnovers 0 td 6 total points, 2009 200 yards 0 td 1 int 60 rating 3 total team points, 2011 3 interceptions. 5 total. 

So Tony romo has played 9 total playoff or winner take all week 17 games. 2 of which he played well in and won, 1 of which he played well in and lost, 1 of which he played decently in but they lost with them scoring 14 points, and 5 of which he either directly cost the game or played flat out horribly in. 


Sorry but I have a hard time believing that him winning 2/3 of the playoff games he has played well in and the offense/ him directly totally failing in all of the other ones is any different then what you are describing being the truth. 

Not to even mention that this stigma is almost completely gone now that he finally lost a single playoff game that he played well in. 

It's total bull shit to pretend that he didn't deserve that big game stigma before this year, when he won every game he played well in and had just horrible games in a lot of the other ones. "
adv0589,You gotta put a .5 in these threads man. You keep listing like a near perfect win total where you can hardly comment
adv0589,"I don't know how you can even expect people to talk about the actual production of the code if you are going to go to the extent of trying to build a QBR conspiracy theory. 

You don't think they would have changed the Batch game which everyone sites if they were doing that?"
adv0589,"... Did that make sense to you?

First off what the actual fuck does your personal opinion have to do with that, and second off are you actually even going to try and deny that there is a general attitude that the RB position is fine?

Jesus its the entire point of the tread don't be so defensive lmao "
adv0589,Jags took their 3rd pick solely on need of an edge rusher when Williams is probably a better player. and reached absurdly on Yeldon. When you take the first 2 picks solely on need as a 3 win team what do you expect. I think its a fine draft but I'm not seeing an A for literally any reason other then them having a high pick. 
adv0589,"So lets be clear here, you watch it now?

All the ""lol are you gay"" jokes aside there is no way I would start watching the lingerie league if the NFL folded. "
adv0589,Jesus you guys realize there is only 100 spots right? There were literally all pro level players in the 90s last year. 
adv0589,"There is nothing QB friendly about this offense with 3 OL players out McCoy having this start to the season http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/12514/lesean-mccoy

and Matthews adjusting to the NFL+ Riley Cooper. 

Don't give me the ""QB friendly"" when he had to drag the offense along and Daltons sits there with a solid running game all season long a good line and AJ Green for most of the season lmfao. 

A monkey could have ran the offense in 2013, you are implying that this applied to the first half of 2014 which is painfully uninformed. "
adv0589,"Yeah they stuck around with some good teams and got 1-2 quality wins, but they are not even close to a 9 win team last season if they played in a different division and without a last place schedule. 

Don't remember the exact number but they have what 6 wins against top 5 picks? (Ten, Jax, Wash, Oak at least) "
adv0589,"Shady is better but we got 2 RBs and Shadys running style is just not a fit there. The first first down is so important in letting the defense rest and tiring theirs out and with an elite OL you need someone to take the easy yards and then fight for what you can after. Shady was murdering drives last year even in his good second half by trying to hit a home run on every damn play. 

For some offense like the Bills Shady's 4.5 YPC on a -2,1,1,18 yard sequence as they need to manufacture big plays but our OL is going to give you a few yards for free every time and there is no shortage of big plays coming from other sources. McCoy going out and putting up some -5 yard run in this offense is fucking devastating and it happened way too much last year. "
adv0589,Flacco... what 
adv0589,"I think this is more of a question of #2, Murray is a boarderine top 5 guy and Matthews/Sproles are probably the best #2 and 3 RBs in the league, obvious homer but there is a pretty clear answer. "
adv0589,He already has 2 as a DC..
adv0589,"People expected them to be good. Like imagine if Romo got hurt in the preseason and Kurt Warner came out of nowhere. Expectations were high, then zero only to have a QB upgrade off the bench somehow, that offense was just absurdly stacked. "
adv0589,Obviously Jerry Jones bought the video because it was so incriminating 
adv0589,I wonder if they will try a Richardsons Wilkerson Williams line.. Not the most conventional but there is so much talent there. 
adv0589,"That is just wrong.

Bradford was plan B for the QB situation. There is no way he made that trade thinking it would get him closer to mariota. "
adv0589,"It's ok if he doesn't pan out as the #1 guy McFadden has 3.3 YPC 3 straight seasons which is a pretty big improvement over that 2.5, they will be fine."
adv0589,"This article literally speculates about things and tries to draw conclusions that go directly against what the staff has said.

They said the knee responded well to pushing it and this guy goes ""will since he wasn't a full go today it obviously didn't go well a week ago"""
adv0589,lmao and I was upset they gave Trent Cole's number to Hicks. What on earth... 
adv0589,Chip loves Beckham
adv0589,"&gt; /1	28/1
&gt; New York Giants

We went 10-6 so it isn't the same but our odds are nearly double and we are a non playoff team "
adv0589,To be fair peters tore an achillies and missed a full year along with having a bit of a recovery time in season for it as well so his gross stats are hurt. 
adv0589,"Playing later in the day is fine, its the other 3 that have to go to STL who get boned if anything"
adv0589,"He could, but viewing this plan as laid out here is flat out terrible. If its a ploy to go undrafted that's nice but if he gets drafted this is a dumb idea. "
adv0589,"Not really the point. Short of this point in 2013 when we thought we had both Jackson and Maclin this is the best overall offensive talent we have had. 

Perhaps 2016 is when it really happens but Agholor, Matthews, Huff/Austin/Cooper, Ertz, Celek, Sproles Murray/Matthews is the best overall talent we have had here and we are paying them like 26m total. When just McCoy Jackson and Maclin would be making north of 30 here. "
adv0589,"Yes, some of the walter football type sites actually had him as a top 10 pick early in the CFB season which was never actually going to happen which is what OP was talking about. "
adv0589,Coughlin could be nearing the end of his rope but the fact that he has had 3 disastrous seasons in a row and still is held that highly says something 
adv0589,"Cant be revisionist the McCoy move had nothing to do with Murray, he went straight for Gore. "
adv0589,Pretty sure this exact same question was asked today lol...
adv0589,"It's funny because everyone recognizes the upside the pick could have but about 10 sec after he was drafted people started the his problems are not a big deal train.

Yo going into last year he looked like the best defensive player in this draft. He had a weak year at Nebraska, was still considered near top 10 but teams obviously knowing the full scale of his issues dropped him into the 2nd. Even the damn cowboys passed on him in the first here. "
adv0589,"Ok, but what issue is there with the results other then  the oddball game here and there. "
adv0589,"Yup, example I like to give is Eagles and Cowboys last year. combined 3-5 vs the NFCW both 4-0 vs the AFCS and both obliterated the team they played from the NFCS. 

Now I am not advocating for our division being great, Redskins and Giants were not good last year, but if you swap out 3 of those NFCW games for the remaining NFCS games we would have had incredible records. 

"
adv0589,1-3 record with the win coming against Orton.. DREAD 
adv0589,Gilbert by all accounts was a total shitshow off the field last season. 
adv0589,"Well the alternatives are Denver after what we saw and you who honestly are a good team but at least I don't view as super bowl quality yet. 

That being said if you have the Pats as SB favorites it is only because GB/SEA play each other before they hit the SB. They are clearly the top 2 teams. "
adv0589,"Watt never ever plays the 3-4 DE role, they literally do everything possible to get him good matchups along the line "
adv0589,"No way worst case scenario they ban specific players, remove an owner/coach from the league etc. "
adv0589,Lol ET has 4 all pros in 5 years and anchored an all time D. Hate to break it to you but in 10 years he is going to be right there. 
adv0589,"Yet we literally shot ourselves in the foot to not beat you last year at home with 2 all pro linemen out, and beat you the year before in philly. "
adv0589,Wow surprising 
adv0589,"Statistically it is a possibility though.

Seriously Foles was not that good in 2013, he had a pro bowl season in half the year and is top 3 all time in single season QB rating. 

Last year our offense was a mess of sorts and our QBs ended up with 4600 yards and 27 TDs. I know it's going to be laughed at but if the offense remains healthy and Agholor is good this year you could be looking at some 4800 yard 30-40 TD season from Bradford. That doesn't mean he will be a top tier QB, but this offense hands out free stats. Sanchez didn't even have the arm strength to throw outside and regularly just out of nowhere wiffed on the mechanics of a throw and threw INTs and would have gone 4300+ 25 TDs. 

Remember Stafford had a 5k 41 TD season a few years back"
adv0589,Todd was probably not even better then the backups last year. 
adv0589,"So you think the one game he showed great pocket presence in and was making all the throws needed is what you should watch if you want to know Foles as a player? We just going to totally ignore how he often felt pressure that wasn't there, lobbed up throws off his back foot instead of throwing it away that always went for INTs or near INTs, and in general had a absurd amount of ugly throws when asked to be on the run?

The line was weak early in the season last year, he was downright awful when under pressure for almost the entire season. Sure Foles is tough but you are literally referencing THE ONLY game where he really was a great asset to the team last year. 

To answer the question directly, do you really think that the best representation of a player is the best game they ever played? Its like someone saying look at the '14 49ers game or the '13 Cowboys game when trying to say he is bad. "
adv0589,".... Did you literally live under a rock for the last 10 years? This Lawsuit has been looming for a long long time. 


I like how this was downvoted. The fucking original lawsuit was filed 4 years ago. The study that started to build this was in 2004, and Goodell's first real statement on it was concern over players returning to play after a concussion. Get a clue, if nothing else the NFL has had an active concussion lawsuit for nearly half of his time spent in office, and he didn't become commissioner until the debate had been started for 2 years. "
adv0589,"Lol everyone just listing games and giving away the outcome and big plays right below it.

Torrent availability is a bit shoddy on older games. Just watch the last game played SuperBowl 49 (Seahawks Patriots) don't think people have realized yet that it will go down as one of the absolute best "
adv0589,Not possible because obviously if they were letting a single PSI out of the balls they would have a league low fumble rate like the Patriots as the reddit detectives have already proven is a concrete fact. 
adv0589,DRC was the Nickel that year COME ON MAN cant sleep on the last great CB we had. 
adv0589,"They don't?


Like do you people not fucking realize that you have to fail like 3 tests before we even find out about them. 

Its painful watching you guys try and separate 5+ failed drug tests from a single incident.  "
adv0589,"This isn't exactly a hard offense to learn here. Keep in mind last year was Maclin's first time with the team and Sanchez played more the half the season as a first year player in it. 

It adds a side of un-predictability but hardly is some recipe for certain disaster. "
adv0589,"After going to jail, leaving the league for 3 years and being some free agent that only 3 teams would take a flier on. 

Are you actually delusional enough to think that people will view AP as a comeback story next season? 

Do you think fucking Greg Hardy is a prime guy for it as well.

You guys can argue about this all you want there is zero chance he wins CPOY. 

Alright guys throw the downvotes around all you want, what are you even going to argue the hardship he had to overcome is? WHAT AN AMAZING COMEBACK HE BEAT HIS CHILDREN AND GOT PAID TO SIT ON THE BENCH FOR A YEAR AND BY MANY IS CONSIDERED THE #1 RB IN THE NFL COMING INTO THE SEASON, WHAT A GREAT STORY"
adv0589,Stress fracture in the foot of a guy that size can be way worse 
adv0589,"Really well. Got Fletcher Cox in the first, Mychal Kendricks in the 2nd and Curry is a good situational rusher. Follow it up with Nick Foles in the 3rd and one of the better slot corners in the 4th in Boykin and it was a a shitload of value in those first 4 rounds. 

Also have slowly flipped Bryce Browns 7th round pick over the last 3 years into the lions 2016 3rd "
adv0589,"So it's cool to put Flowers who was relegated to a Nickle role and released before last season and a Rookie who played only a handful of games. But arguably the best CB in the game and a 7 year vet who was a huge part of a superbowl run are too unproven to make the list?

Not aruging that Maxwell to Williams is a downgrade but it's not like they picked up some 2nd round rookie you know exactly what you are going to get. "
adv0589,All the other shit aside Romo isn't the best player on his offense and that doesn't stop people from listing him 
adv0589,"Exactly, if people really think this was 100% because of being scared of losing a 7th rounder or ""pissing him off"" you are incredibly naive. It hurts your image when every news station runs a story about you drafting a guy being questioned for murder the next day. It is a serious hit to your brand if you end up being part of the introduction line for the next 2 years as he goes through a murder trial over the next 2 years as well. 

Patriots got a top tier TE for what 4 years off a 4th round pick, the football risk reward is there. But I bet if they could redo any fucking draft pick of the last 15 years he is probably the one they say no to. 


I would not be surprisee if the Owners/Goodell pleaded to let him go to UDFA pool because the last thing the NFL needs is the PR hit that will come from him being drafted.  "
adv0589,"Compared to what others? In environments which had 20-30 M less to throw around in cap space you have shit like Stafford getting 17 a year 80% of which was GTD. 45m gtd is not that much when the contract keeps you locked up for 6 years at an incredibly affordable price. The extra money and length are low and the Guaranteed money a year is not nearly as high as you are trying to make it seem. 

"
adv0589,"Yes we are the crazy ones here. Look if McFadden ""turns it around"" this season it is because he flat out didn't give a shit in Oakland the last few years along with the injuries. It is stated as if all this guy has to do is be healthy when he has been healthy and has about 2 good games in that period of time in the last 3 years. "
adv0589,"&gt;Bengals

why"
adv0589,"&gt;Giants and Eagles dramatically improve.

Come on now we were 10-6 with 3 brutal losses last year and were one bad first quarter away from sweeping  and winning the division with our backup QB.

I think you guys are a little better on paper especially since we are not sure how injuries will play out. But come on now with us needing to dramatically improve to get the division. "
adv0589,"Matthews is a top 10 type back as well if healthy. The hope is at least 1 will be healthy at all times. 

Bradford is a crapshoot. But keep in mind he played for years on those Knees and played in 49 of his first 55 games before that. If Thomas Davis can tear his ACL 3 straight years and come back to be one of the best LB I think its reasonble to say Bradford has a pretty good chance of not tearing his ACL again. And its not like he had many injury problems before even with one of the worst OL and weapon groups in recent memory. "
adv0589,Did you really just try and say 4 people are inarguablely better then Brown
adv0589,"So? The point remains you played a team that has never won in the playoffs with this core for years, and a team with a hurt QB. It's not a bad thing that you beat them but getting beat what 45 to 7 vs the actual superbowl team gives a far far far better picture of where you stood vs actual championship quality teams.

Seahawks, Packers, Patriots, all were CLEARLY better teams last year and Dallas, Baltimore have legit claims as well."
adv0589,One of the better DCs ever but it only happened for 10~ years and he isn't a HC so it probably isn't going to happen. 
adv0589,"Yeahhh just going to nip this in the bud.

We have Graham- Kendricks- Alonso- Barwin with a first round draft pick backing up the OLBS and Demeco Ryans backing up the ILBs. 

Our worst LB player was PFFs 3rd rated 3-4 OLB in only 50% of the snaps last season and their top rated pass rush player on a per snap basis. 

We are easily in competition with any other squad in the league and you are crazy if we are not easily in the top 5. "
adv0589,Yeah if we are going to count that one random college student this is one of the best. That was a crazy hour or 2. 
adv0589,"He used words like don't find it hard to believe and ""struck me"" don't really see what your complaint is there"
adv0589,It depends on how you view it. We aren't going to be there statistically but we could be up there talent wise if Rowe is able to preform at either FS or CB  
adv0589,"California is nearly double the population and significantly larger. I literally live within the city limits and would love a team here and can admit it's retarded. 

Not to even mention there is only 3 right now"
adv0589,"Based off what, they are the same age and Stafford has been better up until this point. "
adv0589,"Cox is without comparison the best player on our defense but if you ran out nothing but stats like that he wouldn't seem that way.

Cant really quantify him pushing the pocket back with a double team on him and forcing a sack into one of the other guys waiting arms. "
adv0589,"&gt; 2 OJ

...."
adv0589,"What was that supposed to say lol. He had a shoulder injury that gave him issues in college and never returned after 3 years of getting crushed behind that line in STL, and a single high ankle sprain which accounted for every single game he missed in the NFL before the ACL tear. 

You realize Foles has been injured in all 3 seasons? He broke his hand in 2012, was concussed in 2013, and missed more then half the season in 2014. 

Again I recognize Bradford is an Injury risk, but there are tons of players with 2+ ACL tears in this league at positions more taxing then QB. Thomas Davis literally tore his ACL 3 straight years and is still a stud LB. 

The Eagles cutting edge medical staff obviously thinks this is not unreasonable and as I said if he really had ligaments that are literally incapable of making it through a season it would have manifested itself far sooner then his 4th season. Maybe if his knee got destroyed but it was a very simple ACL only tear that he will have 13 months to recover from. 

Sure he missed the last 2 seasons bue he played fucking 49/55 games to start his career. "
adv0589,Yeah I'd be cool with the trade up for him but if he fell to 52 I'd be on cloud 9
adv0589,Lol what?
adv0589,Gregory was 235 at the combine
adv0589,Who gives a shit what they want this is an entertainment business and fans love it
adv0589,"Well Brown is clearly bettter, OBJ only has 1 season but it was much better then any of Deseans, then there are like 5 guys he is in a mix with but I would take over him for next season like Cobb, Hopkins, Hilton, Evans, Maclin, and I'm sure 1-2 of this rookie class at least will be better players going forward once they are adjusted at least. "
adv0589,And his ability to instantly go north south and hit the hole had nothing to do with that right?
adv0589,"I gotta say people were questioning Erving in the late 20s and the Browns took him at 19 and everyone is like GREAT PICK WOW, BROWNS KILLING THIS DRAFT etc... I don't hate it or anything but if someone mocked that a week before it would not have gotten the response it's getting now "
adv0589,Makes ZERO difference lol
adv0589,"That's absurd to say McCoy is above him. Like the ONLY thing you can say against him is he played in the 40s. 

Like holy shit you guys realize you are basically putting guys who won't/haven't even sniffed the HOF above correct me if I am missing someone but the GOAT RB at the time he retired?"
adv0589,"I hadn't noticed it till I started writing it out, but I couldn't figure out a clever way to put it so I figured I'd wait for someone funnier to do it. "
adv0589,"&gt; Blake Bortles versus the man that many compare him to in terms of style of play, Ben Roethlisberge

Thats a thing?"
adv0589,"Now the question here is, why would that be a deal breaker for some of you when passer rating comes to the same conclusion, the duo passed for 1400 more yards 10 more TDs and 10 more interceptions roughly. 

Other then interceptions only there is no basic QB stat in which the Eagles QBs didn't basically blow Newton out of the water in. Now you may find some other advanced statistic that is better but I still maintain that you cannot sort by a single ESPN.com or NFL.com statistic and get a better list. "
adv0589,"The overall talent level of the team?

Bucs just picked #1 overall with absolute studs all over the team as well man. If 1-2 players get injured, Carr regresses etc your team has nowhere near the amount of depth required to stop a freefall. "
adv0589,They introduced him as 8 like the day after the draft. Think the arm wrestle thing was a joke. 
adv0589,People underestimate how much he just wanted the cash as well
adv0589,"My guess is its account bound to what is on the tv associated with the cable account you logged in with, but I suppose it is possible they did that"
adv0589,"&gt;we keep him

Fixed that for you"
adv0589,"Truthfully if you would rather have a top safety you would be willing to pay what a top CB would make if not more. 

Alright guys throw me a -15 for pointing out that this is just getting cute, I am sure you are sucked into the Aaron Rodgers v Mike Pouncy debate because of his lower contract as well. Don't be retarded that wasn't what OP was asking. "
adv0589,"Second but I am not arguing that point.

Vikings would have to have an all time disaster season for them to not make the playoffs if AP has 2100+ yards and 30 touchdowns so it seems kinda strange to predict him that low based on the possibility they would be 7-9 with him. "
adv0589,Pats Ravens Eagles Chiefs Panthers maybe Detroit all seem to have solid arguments 
adv0589,"Lol, see the issue is you can look at film and see Bradford showing flashes of being a pretty damn good QB behind that shit, while you watch DMC and he is missing the holes created, running straight into the backs of OL players and being constantly outperformed by backups. The last 2 seasons Bradford played he was 25 games, 5400 yards, 35TD ,17 ints, with trash around you that isn't very bad.

Anyways not the point. How delusional are you to sit here and pretend a player who was a top 10 back for years and had one single down year with injuries and a horrid OL isn't better then DMC.

It is fucking hilarious watching you guys go from ""LOL DMC probably won't even make the team our starter will be in the draft its a no risk depth signing"" to ""DMC is going to turn heads this year man"". I sure as shit know it wasn't you looking at his last few years in Oakland because they were just as bad as the numbers say.

Now he could turn it around but it is just silly to sit here and pretend Rice is not a far better player, and to sit here and get pissed that everyone else isn't bought into your RB core. "
adv0589,The article was supposed to be funny and even mentions that he wanted to go there
adv0589,It seems rather relevant when you are knocking other rivals for caring about your team lol
adv0589,You have the Browns in your division. And are totally discounting shit like the Cowboys Seahawks Pats etc being a large step ahead of anyone in your division. 
adv0589,"Doesn't really matter, as long as they keep it in big cities "
adv0589,Well Ryan Matthews played 6 so its close 
adv0589,"Yeah lol what team is just a QB away picking at 2-14...

You guys made the right choice. "
adv0589,There is no way you are actually sitting there right now and thinking Hicks is even going to compete for a CB or S spot 
adv0589,"All jokes aside that list is fucking terrible. 

Suh dirtiest player of all time? Like literally half of the top 12 or so players played in the last 5-6 years? 

Dawkins as a top 10 dirtiest player in the history of the game lmfao

In the cleanest period this game has ever had its absurd to pretend that all of the dirty players are current. "
adv0589,"Because it isn't likely that he just tears it again?

Like how hard is this to understand. He isn't iron man here but if you can admit that the Knee is not some guatantee to tear then what the hell are you basing injury prone on. "
adv0589,"I think you are overestimating what they got, the rumors of 2 firsts Bradford Cox Kendricks Johnson all being in a trade are absurd. 

My guess is chip floated the 2 firsts Bradford and maybe a Kendricks. Decent value but if you like Mariota you gotta take him over that. 

I mean if chip really did go overboard and give them the chance to have Kendricks inside with Casey/Cox duo up front and Johnson over at LT with Bradford at QB and 2 first round pick they obviously are retarded but I just highly doubt that happened. "
adv0589,"You are clearly the one confused, win 2 super bowls in a row then you just make a factory. No you don't just let players walk you just trade the likes of Pepers for another first round pick and draft in the likes of Mario Williams for the next 4 years until you have Suh as an elite DL player and can trade Mario for a first etc. 

If a team like the Giants of 07 and 11 win perhaps it wouldn't be the end of the world. Its the dynasties or near dynasties that already won 3/4 superbowls etc that would just go insane and rip off 10 straight with no competition or some shit. "
adv0589,3.1 ypc behind any line is bad 
adv0589,"Drew Brees..

RG3 had a knee injury and a total meltdown from confidence to play on the field. 

There is nothing to say that he wouldn't be one of the best QBs in the NFL if he didn't have so much immediate success that the became a franchise savior for the worst team to be that on. 

Bradford was absolutely in that type of offense and if he had gone to a real team and not had injury issues would probably be one of the better QBs in the league.  "
adv0589,"Nobody is saying you are going to have that again, there is a big gap between having teams over .500 and being better then whomever you want to designate the 6th best division. "
adv0589,"You can feel that way, but your team is going nowhere with Hasselback in over Luck. "
adv0589,"lol ""tagged"" as if this guy is going to be devastated that his predictions for a division turned up wrong 7 months later"
adv0589,Yes because putting Fitz Tate and Cobb at this point in a tier above Desean was sooooo much better
adv0589,"Randle is clearly their hope. McFadden is busted unless he specifically was not trying at the end in Oakland, Williams has shown nothing other then a few preseason carries, and Dunbar is a clear backup. 

Randle could be a starter in the league IMO but he is a bad starter this guy isn't going to take 250-300 carries and give you more then 4.5 ypc "
adv0589,Yeah total invalidation that someone who has been on TV for hours straight 3 straight days and then had to go directly make these and forgot that a fringe player is no longer on the Titans. 
adv0589,"Its just a term, Murray runs at the line no matter what is happening there. If no hole opens up he just tries to push it forward for a yard or so and deals with it. 

McCoy sees a weak hole or nothing there and tries to bounce it outside off script and loses 2 yards if he fails to make someone miss, sometimes it gets him 5 yards out of thin air and he looks incredible but its laughable to pretend that those are ""the same running style"" as he said. 

This entire post by him is basically him pretending that vision and decisiveness are not real RB traits because ""they all have them"""
adv0589,"Well that 5th year option is a given, that doesn't mean they will keep him. But yes makes no sense. "
adv0589,"Think of it this way.

UDFA is about 450K/yr over the next 4 years

3rd round is about 700k/yr over the next 4.

So when we are sitting here at the end of his UDFA point in 2019 he will have made 1.9 million~ and if he sits out a year and goes in the 3rd only 2.1 by that point.

When you consider how much an extra year will help his development and getting his second contract a year earlier that .2M is pretty irrelevant. "
adv0589,"Holy shit what dude. Its 5m, 8, 9, 9, 9 

The last 2 years only have 1m gtd. So we basically pay him 7.3 a year for 3 years and then restructure to a much smaller deal or just cut him for a loss of 2m and move on. 

You seem to have a base misunderstanding as to how teams handle contracts. someones salary being ""X dollars"" in 5 years does not mean jack shit if none of it is guaranteed. "
adv0589,You can't be serious with actually believing that right now
adv0589,"Most every other response here totally misses the point.

But Eagles fans often for whatever reason bitch and moan about out OL depth when someone who probably isn't even a their top backup has a positive PFF grade (Gardner).

To fully explain for whatever reason despite having top 3-5 players at 4 of the 5 OL positions and a solid guy as the 5th we have 2 very old guys that need to be replaced in 1-3 years. We also have fairly good backups as far as backups go. 

For whatever reason it has become some majority opinion on the Eagles sub that we need quality starters (first/second round picks) right now to be backups and starters of the future.

Obviously as far as backups go there are some quality players who can fill in on our bench, which is why the OP referenced the depth with Gardner showing up there. Obviously since we have quality backups and a top 3 at worst starting line we can handle the LG, RT and RG of 1-3 years down the line in future drafts without really risking much but again it has somehow become some absurd opinion that tons of people share, in thinking that it was a disaster not drafting OL this year. "
adv0589,Well.. He isn't done but it's pretty safe to say he isn't going to be better then he was a few years ago at this point. 
adv0589,MAYBE 2 years down the road 
adv0589,"Come on man Bradford if healthy is on another level as a QB compared to Dalton. 

And the conversations are probably starting with a first. "
adv0589,"Of course not, what is he going to say.. The police brought me in for questioning when my pregnant Ex GF was murdered and the media reported it? Nobody did anything wrong. "
adv0589,"This guy is basically a cowboy fan, he is in literally all over the cowboys sub "
adv0589,We probably taking him btw
adv0589,"He should, but he somehow doesn't. 

At least Hardy and Rice probably regret what they did, Peterson is just pissed off about the reaction"
adv0589,"What numbers lol, there was like at best 2 other NFL starter caliber players on that team. There is a reason he won ROY with a 76 QB rating. 

He was having a good season in 2013 before the ACL tear when they finally got a few good players on the team, mind you still awful overall but at least starting to be good. "
adv0589,"Figured it was 3 years or less 

Ah yes seems like a reasonable post to downvote!"
adv0589,lol 
adv0589,"Been saying it for a month now the thought that he is worth passing over Mariota is absurd. Appears Titans felt the same, like the fuck is this guy even worth a 3rd"
adv0589,"Maclin is the clear loss. But with a first round draft pick spent on a polished player, and the progression of the young guys as well as the ability to bench Cooper if he plays like last season cant be ignored. At times last season teams would double Maclin and Cooper would get absolutely shut down by a CB#2 in 1-1 coverage, a viable player at that position would  loosen it up just as much. 

The QB position is a total fallacy, how is the inability to finish a season from Bradford a regression when the QB of last season got hurt 2 drives into week 7? If Bradford went down week 4 for example we have practically the same deal as last year. 

And again with the run game McCoy was TERRIBLE for a large portion of last season. Sure it was probably a down year and he will be fine going forward, but its not like we are going to miss the heart of our offense from last season he averaged 4.2 ypc and had a league high in negative plays behind one of the best OLs in the NFL. "
adv0589,"Right, so when we are SOLELY TALKING ABOUT INJURIES OUTSIDE OF THE ACL TEAR you think it is relevant to continue to simply respond with LOL BRO YOU REALIZE HE MISS 2 YEARS RITE?

You keep responding with unbelievably irrelevant information.


You do realize how absurd it is that you continue to come in here and give a counter point to me saying ""I don't see why you would assume he would just get another injury if the ACL didn't tear because he didn't have many problems before that"" with ""YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE LAST 2 YEARS HE TORE HIS ACL"".........

I didn't put that qualifier on there someone else did. "
adv0589,I mean Tampa and Jacksonville aren't that far 
adv0589,"Nothing more hilarious then people acting like the ditch the farm for Mariota boys were not in the minority. 

There were reports of lower value trades for #2 then expected and a influx of people who were there just for the Mariota shitstorm as you said but wanting Mariota has been downvoted for months. "
adv0589,"Obligatory reminder that this has zero bearing on what is being talked about because Johnson, Mathis and Kelce lost large amounts of time last season and were among the best rated at their position with a huge amount of less snaps. 

Also despite the circlejerk you are referring to, Eagles did not run many more plays then the top level teams, they get more drives but actual plays per game basis last season there are other teams right there with them. 

"
adv0589,"Yeah, but the point is if foles hadn't gotten hurt at the way end of the season in 2012 he would have missed the better part of 2/3 seasons and missed 2 games in the good year"
adv0589,"Yeah lol I think its a far more interesting conversation on CB2 and safety..... CB1 is one of the big 5 positions. 

Most safties are handcuffed with bad CBs as the risks they can take to break the game open often rely on other people doing their job"
adv0589,Yes I am the salty one here of the 2 of us hahahahahah 
adv0589,"NFCE had 01,02,03,04,07,08 for 6/8 as well recently "
adv0589,"Wolf showed promise but that is absurd. He wasn't even better then Allen that year we just loved him because when he was in Chung wasn't. 

He has great measureables and showed promise but there is nothing to suggest that he is some lock if he magically starts being healthy. "
adv0589,Seems like the Chiefs are the easy pick no?
adv0589,"To be fair a great offense will make farm more then the league average 2pt rate.

But yes moving to the 1 was the only thing that was going to change shit "
adv0589,"Well its a shitty situation. No team is going to trade away the farm so to say to get Dalton and the Bengals are not even going to entertain a first for Dalton. 

If say Dalton had to sit out the last 4 weeks of a season and a backup stole the job meaning he was expendable I imagine its simply a first coming back though "
adv0589,"I mean what you said was incredibly flawed though again because Mathis and Kelce both missed ~6 games with early injuries and Johnson was suspended.

 Not to mention Dallas ran it 30 more times then us lol.. 

If anything the thing you are trying to say should temper the view of the Eagles run blocking on PFF actually would be a argument for it being more impressive then what it shows. "
adv0589,"You got down voted because you either did not understand the nature of the question or gave an answer that just makes no sense. And you aren't even in the negative. 

A offense where he is going to be the only threat on the entire team and probably double teamed while a bottom 10 QB trys to force the ball to him makes no sense as a ""best position to succeed"". 

For example if he somehow fell to Atlanta, or NY or whatever and he went in as the #2 option with a top tier QB. THAT is an ideal situation... There are like quite literally 5 or less teams in the entire NFL that would be more prohibitive to a top WR having early success then Oakland... "
adv0589,You do realize they had that for like 30 years right?
adv0589,"Pittsburgh easily

Carolina

New England

Green Bay

Who knows 

Minnesota

Jets

SF

Not sure

SF

Green bay"
adv0589,"I mean again I don't think a single person picked you in here so there is no reason to address the people ""picking the 49ers over the Seahawks"" "
adv0589,Yes EVERYONE was confused as to whether you were calling OBJ an underachiever and nobody just thought it wasn't funny. 
adv0589,We basically beat ourselves in our game and the Cowboys played without Romo as well. 
adv0589,Lol how the fuck did the tuck rule get in here
adv0589,"Ok? Even in foles ""awful"" season which featured multiple easily correctable mistakes he was about Dalton's level. 

Almost equal levl YPA, Dalton actually threw more interceptions per pass, and Foles threw more TDs then Dalton per pass. "
adv0589,What on earth did you expect that answer to be
adv0589,"Yeah posted it in the other threads but Eagles and Browns depending if he prefers to start out at RT or RG. 


The most talent he has surrounding him as long as he has an assured spot to start at is the place he wants to go to succeed. 

Edit: Downvote away, what place has a top 3 LT to learn under, a guranteed spot to start, the ability to play in between 2 of the best at their position and the ability to move to tackle before the contract ends when Peters retires. Not to mention he would get overrated as the eagles would have the best OL in the NFL if he was any good. 

Not going to go back and change it but this was like -3 within a minute of posting it "
adv0589,Fuck that 2pt at 1 yard line or riot
adv0589,I know but the spot was his before that. 
adv0589,Going back a few years but Steve McNair IMO. 
adv0589,"And what if I told you that he also had one of the better after contact stats, and his style will always lead to a large amount of yards before contact. "
adv0589,"holy shit I can't believe its here guys, I had to chug a few beers to get more prepared for this"
adv0589,"... just no dude.. Lets be abundantly clear that is not a real thing, Rams had an offer of a first round pick for Bradford and chose to make the swap for Foles when Sanchez was a free agent. Thats how much differently actual NFL front offices view this. "
adv0589,Holy shit that Michael Vick reverse bump is real or some shit. 
adv0589,Its like he googled dirty players and threw them in with people he watched in the last 10 years
adv0589,To be clear he didn't ditch Maclin we offered him a fair contract KC just overpaid him
adv0589,Have to go with the Jets as Fitzpatrick is the best QB of the group and Geno I suppose does have a higher turnaround potential then Manuel..
adv0589,Lol they are when you try to come back at a normal schedule and you have to shut it down for another 8 months because it wasn't healed
adv0589,http://www.nfl.com/player/shaunalexander/2504258/profile
adv0589,those are pretty extreme expectations 
adv0589,Righttt because the Packers aren't going to run away with the North by the same logic. 
adv0589,"Well to warn teams at least, if some team took him in the 4th and he actually pulled this shit he would be hated. "
adv0589,"Yeah that poor #1 pick, they only have complete control of a player that should be elite within a year or 2 for 5 years at a cut rate. 

Like as if this guy thinks that its somehow a burden to have good players because you have to pay them, and only get the absolute best draft picks to fill the holes. 

You just keep the best of the best players and trade away the ones you can't afford back for draft picks as those rookie deals end. "
adv0589,Yeah when there is no immediate need you are getting what should be the best tackle in the draft. 
adv0589,It tries not to overrate particularly bad and good days as well as Dalton taking nearly 20 less sacks which probably made this close. 
adv0589,"If Collins is a good player its probably about even, with the obvious fact that the Cowboys in 3 years are going to be absurd. 

Browns are right there as well, the left 3 players are in competition for best at their position and they just added a first round pick. "
adv0589,Yeah its pretty stupid 
adv0589,To be fair a section of New Yorkers like myself view that series as one of the greatest things to ever happen in baseball.
adv0589,Makes fun of bad Luck comparisons while comparing him directly to Dalton... 
adv0589,"He brought him in for a visit. If he is cleared i don't see the issue. 

Makes literally no sense that he brought in a guy for a visit when he was a first round pick and then is going to sit there after we did not get a single OL out of the draft and decline him on a UDFA contract. 

The ""culture"" circle jerk is getting a bit out of control "
adv0589,"See this is kinda my point. You just assume your offensive line is unmatched and that they are so strong that any RB will just plow behind them.

Thomas at LT, Bitonio at LG, Mack at C are all better then who the cowboys have at those positions. Their Line is incredibly stacked, yet if we had a browns fan here talking about how their line can make any running back into a stud you would laugh and point to how they just had an average to slightly above average attack behind it before Mack went down. "
adv0589,You get a big time signing bonus day 1 though. Like for example Suh got a 60~M dollar check the day he signed. 
adv0589,I mean barring their ability to find a new QB Dallas has a 2-3 year window here while the Seahawks may be on their way to the next colts/patriots run of dominance considering the absurd amount of young talent they have. 
adv0589,"Don't know about that, how high is he going to go after sitting a whole year out.. Once he hits the 3rd round next year he is throwing money away"
adv0589,"Lol, best defense in recent memory that shut down one of the GOAT offenses to win the superbowl in embarrassing fashion. Dunno what you are looking for but the Hawks' defense will go down as an all time unit. "
adv0589,3 clearly better WRs at least how man WRs do you think are in the top 10
adv0589,That's such a weak opinion dude. Point out what issue you have with the general lists which also points out what single QB stat provides a better picture. I am sure there is some PFF signature stat or FO stat that does some sort of better job but there sure as shit isnt another single basic stat that does a better job 
adv0589,"It's more of a long term move, doubtful that he would even be a big improvement over what they currently have.


Edit: Ah the ol' downvoted for complimenting a teams line by their fans. "
adv0589,"I think Brady is pretty securely in the #2 spot.

Seems the Brady/Rodgers debate is better then the #2 spot. 

And give me a break with the Romo shit in this thread. He is a great QB but put Big Ben or Brees probably Manning on that team and they are just as good if not better he isn't the second best."
adv0589,"Nope dead.


But really he usually isn't there day 1 for whatever reason, probably so you don't have 2 of these guys in the same role for ESPN. 

Gotta think hes sitting there at home pissed off that Ray Lewis gets a spot on the panel to throw out incoherent nonsense with a few references to god worked in though. "
adv0589,"Yeah i suppose you viewed the Bears in 2010 as a legendary run to the CG as well when they beat the 7-9 seahawks at home. 

If you had played the Patriots close it would have been different. Beating 2 teams that were going nowhere before getting embarrassed by the first top quality team doesn't really mean much. "
adv0589,You guys overstate that. Sure he doesn't have great pocket presence and makes slower reads but its not like he can't take a hit and stay in and throw it again or some shit. 
adv0589,Since when is being like 13th or 16th in ppg allowed not considered good especially when you consider the talent on offense. Holy fuck are you guys even following this conversation or just such blind cowboy homers that you can't realize that the statement pretending that Romo has had to deal with historically bad defenses was absurd. 
adv0589,"Steelers are one of the prime ""why the hell are you a fan of that team when you grew up in _____""teams. 

Shouldn't be that big of a surprise.  "
adv0589,"Yeah I could see him on there just because of the rep he has in this period of time. 

But holy shit number 1 bahahahaha"
adv0589,Did you seriously just ask this question
adv0589,[bro](http://images.realclear.com/294556_5_.jpg)
adv0589,"Probably should knock Huff off and put Ertz on for the Eagles. Had a 10.0 grade in 600 snaps, huff wasn't really a big piece of the offense last year. 

Makes the situation look far far worse then it was. "
adv0589,"&gt;we'll just plug in the best offensive lineman from this recent drat

Uhhhh no, he wasn't. And I really don't get what you are trying to say. If Frederick goes down or to a lesser extent martin your run game with those RBs is going to be average at absolute best. "
adv0589,"That wasn't real dude lol, been saying it in every one of those threads Bradford 2 firsts and Kendricks was going to be it at absolute maximum "
adv0589,He doesn't think he did anything wrong
adv0589,"Who fucking cares, its funny. "
adv0589,"That shit is overrated man, we upgraded the weak spots on our defense in MLB depth and CB to go along with a top tier front 7, have the best special teams in the league by a wide margin and added to it. And whatever the hell happens at QB we have good pass game options from Agholor Matthews Ertz etc, the deepest RB roster in the NFL and a top few OL in the league. 

There is a wide range we can fall in but our floor and ceiling are higher then the Giants IMO. 

We had a lot of injuries to players that are not injury prone on the OL, played most of the season with our backup QB, had a terrible secondary that gave up the most big plays of any team since 2005 and nobody wants to broach it but McCoy was awful at times last season (I am sure you noticed it in our first game). We still won 10 games, we have had trouble beating good teams but we have just been a buzzsaw for bad teams, i just think at worst we will win the easy games on the schedule and get up to 7~ wins at absolute minimum other then unpredictable factors like the culture just collapsing like what happened to you 2 years ago or 49ers last year. "
adv0589,"Lets put it this way, every single thing that a WR does other then base physical attirbutes Cooper is better then White at right now"
adv0589,Come on man hes a nice player but top 5 at CB is insane. 
adv0589,"That is flat out false. 

No offense but you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Half the reason he is so butthurt is that this was his dream team to play with originally. "
adv0589,"A lot of the things people call him hypocritical on are kinda stupid. 

Like no trying to take blows to the head out of the game does not mean you can't play games on Thursday or take away 2 preseason games add a bye and bring 2 more games in for more money. "
adv0589,What are you even talking about
adv0589,Bucs probably said that to make it look like there wasn't tension already 
adv0589,I think you need to list out your top 15 or so QBs and realize that there are some guys in that rage who are very far ahead of Dalton. And even if Brock was a success its a stretch to even call him above Dalton right now. 
adv0589,"Adding weapons does nothing to the quality of the QB, simply effects his production. "
adv0589,"Stafford is only 1 year older, has had better seasons, and was just as good of a prospect from day 1. 

Can make all the excuses you want for him being in washington Stafford had to go into Detriot and RG3 could easily be damaged goods by this point. "
adv0589,"He doesn't play 3-4 DE at all. You can't compare QB hits with players that are legit there to mainly suck up blocks and kill run plays when the Texans are going out of their way to get 1-1 matchups and line him up against the weakest people all over the line. 

Doesn't mean JJ Watt is not the best but that is a completely unfair comparison. "
adv0589,"It's not even saying he will be a top 10 guy eventually, if the title here is correct it directly means that he is the 13th best QB in the NFL right now"
adv0589,A dropped catch that goes for an INT or some heave at the end of a half is not the same as some missed read that goes into the defenders arms. 
adv0589,"And.. Demarco Murray who had 5.5~ ypc a few seasons back behind the line that they use as an excuse all the time for being ""so bad"""
adv0589,Not gona go check it but I would be very surprised if Dallas was not younger.. Don't think anyone outside of the RT is above 24
adv0589,God It's going to be amazing if you guys pull in 5-6 wins this season
adv0589,No QB
adv0589,Eagles trade up and gain net value on the trade chart and they list dolphins as winner lol
adv0589,"They were like 11th in DVOA just last year, there is more to evaluating defensive skill other then LOL U SEE FLETCHER GET BURNT BY DEZ BRO"
adv0589,"I understand that, again it makes it hard to analyse because you can't fault the picks they made in the first 2 rounds long term. But a trade up in the 3rd probably would have been better then reaching on OL depth. 

Just saying its like building a great passing offense around Geno Smith, yes there could be great pass blocking and 2 all pro level WRs but Geno alone is going to not allow that to go to the full potential. There really isn't much logic to drafting so heavily on O line then letting a top tier RB go with no replacement in what looks to be one of a maybe 2 year championship window before Romo starts to really get up there. "
adv0589,"Still a fairly talented team, but Kaepernick is going to have to take over and start carrying them which it remains to be seen if that's possible. 

Still people are going to their horribly underachieving record of last year and just subtracting 3-4 wins which is retarded. They still have way more talent then the bottom feeders and would be right there at the top of playoff contention in any other division. 

But obviously with all this turnover and a new unproven coach this shit could implode "
adv0589,If you are going to have a QB who never hits the field might as well have it be a great locker room guy who works his ass off
adv0589,"Good lord it's a comparison. Talented QB who had shown success at a NFL level who became available due to injury concerns. If a damn 6th round pick filled in for a QB for a season and won his first playoff concerns people would say ""is he the next brady"" without meaning that they directly wonder if he is the next GOAT 4 time super bowl winner at QB.

Also I seriously question how many of you watched Brees in SD. There was a fucking reason they had the #1 overall pick with him starting 11 games in 2003 and they drafted a QB. "
adv0589,"He was only here 2 years.

I think its probably Van Buren, played 7 years here (entire career) 5 time first team all pro, 2 time NFL champion, member of the 75th anniversary team etc 

McNabb is deff ahead of Cunningham though"
adv0589,"&gt; /s

WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN "
adv0589,"He is reporting chip said this, not that he didnt. "
adv0589,"Obviously not everyone did, but this is not some ""few people"" type deal. I specifically remember some guy pulling like a -10 for simply suggesting Winston in the top 5 in some related context, responses saying I wouldn't want him it the first to that. Now we have shit like that ""Winston stiffed ESPN because of recent coverage"" thread where everyone is going ""good on him"" and that type of shit because ESPN was bringing up character concerns. 

There is ZERO question that the general consensus opinion of him here would be torn into shreads and downvoted off the page now. And the guy hasn't touched a football since, unless his fucking pro day or combine changed their over the top character questions. "
adv0589,"&gt;plus Mannion is a potential franchise QB

... You could say that about almost any QB that gets drafted if you are going to call him one "
adv0589,"Its nice to see at least see someone who is realistic about it, McFadden has some of if not quite literally the worst vision in the NFL. That is not the guy you ""just plug into the offensive line"" and let them get 2 yards before contact every play. 

I think Randle eventually emerges as the starter but the carries are going to get split up quite a bit. I guess if by some miracle Williams is healthy he could be a wild card as well.

Hard to do with the current PR situation but Ray Rice would make you so much better then you currently are. "
adv0589,Pretty sure he was on there don't remember the reasoning. 
adv0589,Which is directly why he isnt a DE..?
adv0589,"You serious lol, Sheldon Richardson and Aldon smith just the last few years. "
adv0589,Wow that just sounds retarded 
adv0589,The NFL powers to be make you do shit like miss field goals and draft poorly?
adv0589,BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO YET??
adv0589,Does literally anyone but maybe Shaq Thompson even qualify for this?
adv0589,So you think the fairest way to judge his position in this case is to assume multiple other players have amazing seasons and the Vikings go 7-9 with Peterson at 2100 yards + a 30~ TD season
adv0589,The idea is you bring him in just for 2pt plays
adv0589,He basically directly out played Foles head to head in what was quite possibly Foles best game as an Eagle. 
adv0589,"Well the all pro and what not argument isn't really that valid I agree but I would argue that Smith is a step down from Thomas and Peters. Dude a huge body still 24 with all the potential in the world and already probably the #3 tackle in the game but I am just saying there are some games like say last season where JPP was getting some good disruption on him that literally almost never happens with Peters.

For example when we played the Giants I don't even know if he got past the LOS against peters and they eventually tried to switch sides of the defense to get something in."
adv0589,"Pretty sure we would be #1, that or maybe the bills since they hardly take a hit. Jets also might get better with Fitz lol"
adv0589,Think JJ Watt would be far better 
adv0589,"Yeah they seem like the best answer, I don't think it leads to much this season but they got a shitload of tier 2 free agents. Still too many holes on the team to compete this year but nobody talks about some of the good signings they made. "
adv0589,"I don't know whats more absurd, projecting him as Brees or comparing him to Collins and Orton. 


Not that it's really the point of this orignal article  but you did some pretty flawed breakdowns here. 

You make it sound like Brees was some god in SD and this is an absurd comparison. Yet if you look at the numbers Bradford had clearly better production in his first 3 years. Brees sat a year then 77 QB rating 67 QB rating while Bradford went 76,70,83. Bradfords 3rd year of 3700 21/13 83 QB rating literally obliterates anything Brees did in his first 3 years.

Then you move to the 4th year where Bradford eventually tore his ACL 7 weeks in. This is also Brees breakout year. Yet Bradford was on pace for more touchdowns more yards and only 1 more int if he played out the full 16(14 TD 4 int 1700 yards at a little less then 7 games vs 27 7 and 3100 in a full season). While also ignoring that Bradford at this point had the worst surrounding casts in the NFL and Brees had Gates prime Tomlinson etc. 

Up until this point in their career (7 games into their 4th year in the league) Bradford has basically been unquestionably better, than the ""absurd comparison"". Yet you choose to compare him to Collins who had 51 touchdowns to 64 interceptions at this point? Bradford with the worst offensive cast in the NFL bar none put up 58 and only 38 ints in the same period.. 


Now I am not sitting here saying Bradford has some great chance of becoming an elite QB overnight here. But that wasn't the point of the article really it was more referring to the question if he could be the next QB who is obtained through injury concerns that turns out to be a great player for the team. But good god you clearly went out of your way to try and paint him as negative of a light as possible in that post. 


Edit since I looked back at it 

They both spent 5 years with their first team. But you add up gross stats like yards and TDs while listing Brees at ""4 seasons"" because he sat out his rookie year and follow it up by trying to say that Bradford got his stats in 5 seasons when he missed basically 2 years worth of games...? Not to even mention that Bradford. 

That's before even mentioning that you shorted him 2k yards in the comparison. Bradford has the same yards as Brees in SD in 9~ less games. Had he finished out his 2013 season he would have been 1.5k+ yards ahead tied in TDs and with 10 or so less interceptions in the exact same amount of games. And thats without LT and Gates for his good seasons.... Again he isn't going to take a step into top 5 QB range next year but this post ranged from posting stats in the most negative possible light for Bradford possible and some aren't even accurate. 

To be honest if Bradford had a few weapons in STL and did not miss 2 seasons you would probably take his tape and stats back to 2005 and get roasted for pretending Brees would have a better career... Of course you would be wrong in 2005 but come on now Kerry Collins and Orton... "
adv0589,"The Kyrie one they had a horrible record that IIRC was by far the worst, but in a hilarious twist a pick they got from the Clippers won the lottery so that had 1 and 3 or 4. The Bennet draft I believe was a bit of luck (10~%) and the one last year was absurd. "
adv0589,Beasley 
adv0589,You can actually sit there right now and say you would rather have Geno on your team compared to Brotles?
adv0589,"Why would a RB who thrives off physical punishment like Murray not be an ideal back for a team that looks to do nothing other then tire teams out on offense. Sure he will get tired but we have the best 2nd and 3rd RBs in the NFL to take strain off of him when that happens. If Mathews can be healthy in a backup role for most of the season I doubt Murray sees more then 260 carries. 

And I don't really get where you are going. Eagles have by far the best injury history since Kelly joined the NFL. Admittidatly the injuries that we have had have all been extremely costly, but if anything being on this team has been the best bet to stay healthy in the NFL. 

And its not some special group of non injury prone players we had here, the team was ravaged by injuries for the 2 dream team years before Kelly took over and instantly turned that around to best in the league overnight. "
adv0589,"&gt;Have historically bad defenses is considered talented rosters now? Damn.

That is a direct fucking quote from you what are you even trying to say"
adv0589,"I think some team will take the shameless 5-6th round tag on him and just hold him as a massive upside pick. 

I mean shit even if you give it 50/50 odds he gets arrested thats a good gamble there, and it doesn't sound like 50/50"
adv0589,Cowboys are the #1 team fairly sure
adv0589,"You realize almost every player that has left this team has expressed positive thoughts about his time here right?..

Boykin is pissed that he is relegated to the nickel and Mathis has been trying to get traded so he makes more money for 2 straight years. "
adv0589,"Is that what I said? He said historically bad defenses. He had one year with the #2 defense in the NFL, and other years where they were top 15-20. Since when did those become historically bad defenses. "
adv0589,"Did people actually expect this to be fully commercial free lmao. 

Not to mention every time they said commercial free they said til 9 or something every time "
adv0589,Yeah there are multiple mocks out there with him rot even reaching 20 lol.. Its not like it was an extreme value pick but it was within his range 
adv0589,"Because it's a racial term. You can debate about whether it needs to be changed but holy shit those of you eating up this Schneider bullshit about term of honor go to some reservation and call them redskins to their face lmao. 

Only reason this shit flies is that it is offensive to such a fringe section of society, if this was an equal level term to any other race in this country it would be loooonnnng gone. 

I'm sure you are cool with negro as well as it isn't a racist term it just a offshoot of the word black referring to skin tone. "
adv0589,"Yes but you have to directly look at ins and outs. Murray and Matthews have to match 4.2 YPC from McCoy last year, that is the actual production that led to our team last year, that would be incredibly disappointing to not be matched. 

Bradford is a blatantly more talented QB compared to Foles, ran probably the most similar offense you could at Oklahoma compared to chips offense in the NFL. The main critique is he will get hurt. Well Foles got hurt week 7 last year and had some pretty awful games before that I don't see the proposed drop off in production.

It just seems that with other teams this logic is never applied. The bills have a new RB, new WR in the mix, new TE, some new linemen, a new QB, a whole new coach and defensive scheme along with a new offensive scheme. You don't see people in those threads going hmm well Spiller wasn't very good last season and they brought in a top tier RB we will have to see how they adjust they are viewed on the quality of the team compared to last season. "
adv0589,My guess is probably a first 
adv0589,"I just flat out don't get this. Having a top tier line does mean you will have a solid run game but building an amazing line and then handing the keys over to a group of backups/fringe starters is a colossal waste. Its being talked about if taking off hundreds of yards off the table that you probably will be in going with what you have is just not a big deal. 

"
adv0589,You can't possibly think Jurruh is letting him past can you 
adv0589,"Its this retarded path were people can justify almost anything happening leading to it being rigged. Like if the huge market Knicks or Lakers take it tonight its rigged for them. When Cleveland won it 3/4 years its them making up for Lebron, when they won it for Lebron its them trying to get the hometown kid scenario. 

Ignoring that shit like revitalizing the Wizards DC area shit would have made tons for the league and they kept finishing in the 3-5 range outside Wall. Or that a team like Orlando lost Howard and is on the fringe as a team with a brand new stadium and keeps finishing in unfortunate positions. Or Philadelphia one of the countries biggest markets and most storied franchises keeps not winning with a good chance at winning etc. "
adv0589,NFL record 10 defensive touchdowns for Eli Manning has earned him defensive player of the year honors 
adv0589,"For the millionth time.  It was a PR move. You would be on every news outlet as they team who drafted the guy in the murder investigation and if he was found to be part of it would be forever tied to a murderer. 

He was cleared after the draft so teams didn't feel that risk. "
adv0589,"Not real sure where you are trying to go with that.. 

Just saying if you are going to put a player on there which clearly would not be on there if not for your team you cant go in another post and go ""you are a homer for putting lindsey over travis"""
adv0589,"I mean there is no question that Romo didn't magically have his best season behind the best OL in the game a top 5 RB and probably the #2 WR in the game with a top 5 TE. 

Doesn't do much to take away from his career though. 

He has been a Great QB but hes been firmly in the 5-10 range his entire time and only has 2 playoff wins. Players like Big Ben are boarderline cases have been rated exactly the same and have superbowls. "
adv0589,"Just different sports, a single nba player can mean more, there are usually only 1-2 franchise players if any in a NBA draft, and teams actually try to tank. "
adv0589,"And yet again you are just turning it into who was the best player with a injury the year before award. 

Like for example Maclin had by far the best season of his career last season after an ACL tear the year before. He of course isn't even really in the conversation. Chris Harris JR had an ACL tear in January and took a step forward to one of the best CBs in the NFL last year and got 3 fucking votes. 

It isn't even who came back best from an injury to you guys lol it is quite literally who is the best player that got hurt. "
adv0589,"QB Winston

RB Bell

LT Lane Johnson

LG Bitonio

C   Frederick

RG Martin

RT Robinson

TE Ertz

WR OBJ

WR Evans/Watkins"
adv0589,Even offering 9m probably offends him to the point that any hometown discount is gone. 
adv0589,"How about the 26 year old how has made 4 straight all pro teams since his rookie season, and the centerpiece of one of the best defenses of all time?"
adv0589,"lol what specific year would you say any one of those 3 was the MVP and didn't win it due to being overlooked.
"
adv0589,"As absurd as the strawman argument he has built up around this you do realize Chris Johnson had a 2500 AP yard season with 16 TD and a 2k yard rushing season and didn't even get a single MVP vote right.

Still obviously the logistics of them having a bad enough record with him tearing up the record books is absurd. "
adv0589,"No, this is like me telling you I have a computer formula that can find me the length of something that is right 99%, now you can do the leg work and measure it exactly and get a better answer, or you can use the old method which involves some shoddy method that is right 90% of the time. 

Now If my computer program gives you a 99% accuracy to the actual measurement but I don't tell you how its done it is CLEARLY the better method, but you are doing the equivalent of pointing out a few times that it was very wrong and then telling me that since you can't see the inner workings of the blatantly more accurate program you simply can't trust it and it is therefore garbage. 


&gt;There isn't a single stat for it. There are all kinds of stats. You look at them all individually. Passer Rating is the closest thing we have to an approximation and we all acknowledge that it's flawed so we go to other stats to argue more in depth. We accept that passer rating doesn't make you the best QB, and that's fine. Passer Rating doesn't care. QBR tries to do it ALL.

And I don't get where this comes form, what is this straw man argument. When did this become a thread about people saying the eye test is better, why can't QBR be treated as just another stat to consider. I guarantee that if I wanted to build a list of the leagues best QBs and dropped a ""20 best list by QBR"" at the top of the tread despite it CLEARLY providing the best picture of QB play from a single stat I guarantee the entire thread would devolve into LOL BATCH, WHAT IS CLUTCH, BSPN type stuff when if passer rating was used nobody would say anything. 

It just has this absurd stigma that it is totally worthless around here which makes no sense. 

&gt;Because somebody going 22/28 for 406 and 7 TDs is at least ranked above somebody who threw 2 picks and didn't break 200 yards.

That's great for you, Fitzpatrick was a top 10 QB last season in passer rating at 9th right behind the great Carson Palmer. Who of course are both roughly 9-15 spots behind basement dwellers like Flacco, Stafford, and Newton. Its almost as if every single one of these things come out with a stupid result. "
adv0589,Don't worry you still earned it in our hearts!!
adv0589,What on earth? The NFL in no way wants one of its 2 most popular players to retire
adv0589,"Why would someone with almost no legit argument for being the best pass rusher belong ""in the conversation"".."
adv0589,"They are both important. 

You are missing that you had both last season and now have one. 

As I said when it's not your team and it's the best comp in the league to your run game (Browns) how do you feel about it?

It's easy to sit there and only look at it as a homer, but when it is the joke of the league with what most people view as better RBs behind a line that is about equal across the board do you still think that the line will just easily create an elite running game?

You guys have this victim complex where you seem to think that if your team runs for 1750 yards in a RBBC we will all be shut up without realizing that that's not even outrushing your main guy last year. Gush about Randle and McFadden etc all you want there is a reason Mcfadden signed for the minimum and Randle couldn't steal carries from Murray last year. Your running game is going to take a good sized step back. "
adv0589,Literally nothing was surprising. I guess Colts going with Dorsett. 
adv0589,"Look at this dumbass he thought Trent Richardson would be a good player LMAO RITE TOTAL BUST.

Like lets face it guys there is a pretty good chance one if not more then 1 of these picks you all love right now in the 3-8 range will totally flop. "
adv0589,Jesus it was just a freak occurrence that sorta fucked up the formula. Once again what statistic provides a better list of QB play that isnt some advanced stat from somewhere else that nobody uses either. 
adv0589,lmao didn't that adjusted interception article argue that he should have been #1 in interceptions... 
adv0589,"I dunno I think he had Jackson like potential, I would have lived with him at 20, and I bet the Ravens pick him if Perriman was gone.

Still you are getting a early preview of how the Luck contract is going to gut that team. "
adv0589,"You are overplaying the roster turnover because most of the guys were big names. All turnover in the secondary was to get rid of under preforming players, and the only other defensive change was bringing a LB into a 3 man rotation.

We swapped out RBs let a WR walk and drafted a guy to replace him and swapped out QBs. 

Where are the comments in the Bills threads that they have a new coach coming in a new QB and a new RB so they will flop early etc?

Where are the comments about Dallas that they just swapped out have their defensive roster and have a new RB will thus struggle etc.

It is a obstacle to work through but also a logic not being applied to any other teams. "
adv0589,"We got the best WR and DB available in the first 2 rounds, fleeced the Lions in a trade for our 4th rounder and nearly tripled the value of the pick.. Only questionable pick whatsoever is Hicks.

How can you poke holes in 6th-7th round picks as if they were supposed to be polished players. "
adv0589,"And again you can't form any sort of argument outside of injury, which was the entire fucking point. 


Ask yourself, put Tannehil behind the offense in 2012 that Bradford had. Is he doing much better then his 2012 season? And that's before Bradford took a huge step forward in 2013 and was looking like a star of sorts before he went down. "
adv0589,"There is almost no chance he goes first next year. A low chance he goes second. He probably is 3rd round on.

This is 100000% Pr guys. 

Nobody wants to be the team that took a chance on the guy with the Murder case hanging over him, let alone be part of the ""Collins, drafted by the _______ in the 7th round of this years NFL draft has been taken in on chargest of first degree murder"" shit that would have hit every news station in the country.

adv0589,"They stood out to me, AFC is wide open. "
adv0589,"I don't think so, but i suppose it is worth a shot"
adv0589,Are you kidding  lol
adv0589,"""Come from his agent""

You can't possibly be so in love with the guy that you can't see that no agent would be pushing some PR murdering agenda like this without his client wanting it. 

Guys can support him all you want, but he still clearly thinks what he did was fine and that everyone is just out to get him. "
adv0589,Bitonio has only played G and Scherff is probaby playing RT though lol
adv0589,"lol got a higher PFF grade then Sitton only playing 9 games..

Dunno what exactly you are rating them by but Mathis and Yanda basically doubled anyone else on a points/snap basis, you can hate PFF all you want but that didn't just happen out of nowhere and people bring that up to build Yanda's case all the time. "
adv0589,"Jake long was a mega prospect and Ryan although a great prospect was not considered one of those ""YOU HAVE TO DRAFT HIM"" type guys. 

Not quite the same but imagine Brotles playing out very well and people asking why Clowney went #1 8 years from now. Although Ryan was a better prospect "
adv0589,Ayyyy 
adv0589,"One of them was also not on the NFL radar before Chip, also we just going to ignore that Barkley played games that year, and Foles played through a concussion vs you and it basically gave away 2 wins we should have had?

That point doesn't really matter though, are you missing the fact that he took Sanchez into an offense based team who was the laughing stock of the NFL and went 5-4? again with the losses being to top tier teams other then Washington..."
adv0589,"I still totally fail to see what the hell you are even talking about. Agreed with him on his first point and then tried to explain the difference. and you respond with ""how many times does he have to say he's not arguing with you""? 

There is a gap between Thomas and Peters and the rest of the OTs. the PFF rating does not mean he is twice as good or some shit, do people actually see JJ watt at 100+ and think that means they think he is better then Suh McCoy Cox and Casey combined? 

If you never make negative plays the score adds up really fast. 

Do you think him saying ""I am not arguing with you"" means that you are no longer to respond to anything he says?"
adv0589,"It is the answer but I still maintain it shouldn't count. They got a whole new QB (who got hurt and was replaced by a HOF level QB), drafted a HOF level WR in the first round, brought in a top 10 all time RB for a 2nd rounder and got back another HOF level WR who missed most of the season the year before. 

Basically Trent Green, Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, Tory Holt, and Issac Bruce  were just added to the team compared to the 4-12 year. 

Its not like people were going into that year thinking the Rams were a doormat. "
adv0589,Holy shit what? You are the one who brought the GB situation in here what are you even trying to say 
adv0589,Namath has possibly the most important post merger moment in nfl history and in his defense wasn't as good as he should have been due to injury 
adv0589,"We have a sample size of the Bills going 9-7 last year?

They made big improvements to their line and brought in McCoy along with hopefully a healthy breakout year from Watkins and the addition of Harvin. 

They both have inept offenses, but it is a much much smaller jump to say the Bills will win 1 more game with the improvements they made then it is to say the Jets are an 11 team win on paper after we watched them basically give up last year. "
adv0589,"Wow this might be the worst list I have ever seen... Eagles at 22, Lions 21, packers at 29, JAGUARS AT 6????,"
adv0589,"To be fair here the Rams were there for 50 years. 

Still doesn't seem like a team that needs to move, but there is a much greater connection. "
adv0589,Pretty sure UDFAs can only make the league minimum 
adv0589,"OK, so you say that. compare 2014 then. You guys give these answers that just totally ignore the full picture. Are we supposed to feel bad for Dalton with AJ Green and Sanu a good line and 2 good RBs? Like oooohhhh poor Dalton he has a top tier offense built around him and is the biggest factor hold them back. 

Meanwhile its totally cool to look at Foles with 3 linemen out McCoy averaging like 50 yards a game for his stretch of the season and Sproles and Maclin being the only ones worth jack shit on the entire offense, and go ""Chip kelly offense it was boosted stats""

To be clear Foles was traded because he does not make quick decisions, and has no mobility. Both of which are the biggest attributes Chip wants. "
adv0589,Morris is very questionable for top 10
adv0589,"You guys saying Tannehil realize Stafford is like 4 months older right. I feel like people forget that he was that young when he came into the league.  

Stafford seems like the kind of guy where when he finally gets it all together at 30 will be one of the games absolute elites. "
adv0589,"He belongs nowhere near it. He gets paid massively for his work, he's worth it but there is no way in hell he belongs on a list like then when there are players like Luck and Wilson who would make that team better in a swap and cost 1/3 the price. Let alone that like any of the top 12 QBs would be better in a swap as well. 



"
adv0589,You are missing your best player!!
adv0589,"lol, Bradford is without question the biggest target here. "
adv0589,"You have to think about it differently, are the Chargers, a team where he has to play tackle day 1 and will be greeted as the savior of the line the best fit for him?"
adv0589,I updated the OP with some of the shit i found in like 5 minutes of searching. The sub has had WAY WAY too much information on Winston over the  last 4 months to go back and find threads with large discussions of Winston in say October/November when the opinion was at an all time low. 
adv0589,"LOL WHAT 

come on dude they aren't going in with emergency ""4th string"" type QBs. Worst case senario some camp body sticks on for a few weeks using bradys roster spot til the suspension is over. "
adv0589,"You heard it first guys, Garrets ineptitude of the first 3 years was an amazing strat to.. Get draft picks or something to build for the future!"
adv0589,Cooper and Warmack were much better prospects. Cooper was being called the best in 20 years. 
adv0589,"Ugh I always liked Williams, this will be upsetting. I hope they Skins' it "
adv0589,I like how everything is so well done and then probably the easiest possible thing to do is fucked up with the I in Willis not being in line. 
adv0589,"Because  you said it would be ""good"" to have that for the full bracket when in reality that would be incredible even if you got to see every teams draft board and got to strap the GM down of every team and subject them to a lie detector as you fill out your mock. "
adv0589,"Still one of the best few backups in the league if not the best.. 

In this situation the Eagles defense only real weakness is masked, top tier run game setup is more valuable, and they have a top 3 QB.

There are other teams like the Jets but they are no doubt one of the best few teams in this situation. "
adv0589,No he didn't..
adv0589,"Really like the first 3 as far as value picks Johnson could easily be the best CB in the draft, and Strong in the 3rd is obscene. Don't know enough about the players after tbh"
adv0589,"There couldn't be a worse analogy than what was posted they said, you took that challenge on and proved the world very wrong.  "
adv0589,All I'm going to say is i don't hate the pick but that would have gotten obliterated in a mock before the draft by this sub. 
adv0589,Yet here we are with 8 rings on the offense side and 5 on the  defense
adv0589,"Laughably false? Last year where he is debatable for 4-6 or so is the only year that isn't 100% true for.... What are you trying to argue here, Cowboys fans seem to always blindly dismiss this but what years are you talking about here. "
adv0589,"He was still an elite runner and his only year he was a good passer. 

Vick was literally terrifying in 2010, 2nd in MVP voting with like 6 games missed. As you said he was exciting in his Falcons day but yeah his passing was pretty damn bad back then. "
adv0589,How is a top 10 MLB pick who was out of football in 2-3 years who came back to have a great season not a comeback

adv0589,"Alright lets get this straight, I am one of the conductors of the pump the brakes on Carr train.

But this is an awful comparison.

1- Geno has 2 years of sample size, was asked to do far less in his offense with a better line and honestly a better running game. Decker is much better then anything he had, you absolutely cannot ignore that Geno did not improve from year 1 to year 2.

2- You can rattle off all the teams you want, Raiders had objectively the hardest schedule in the NFL last year. 

3- Geno has a .73 TD/int ratio while Carr's is 1.75 . Geno has 25 TDs in 2 years while Carr had 21 in his rookie year while going over double the amount of attempts in between interceptions (50att/int to ~23).

Carr was asked to do far far more (600 attempts to Geno's 800 total in 2 seasons) with less offensively, against harder competition and clearly had a good amount more success. Carr would literally have to throw an interception every 10 passes for his next 200 attempts to match what Geno did. 

You have to completely and totally ignore Geno's horrible amount of interceptions before this is even a conversation and even then i think you have to say Carr has a decent edge. 

That being said I do think Fitzpatrick will end up your QB and you will be solid at the position, but come on now with this defense of Geno using Carr. "
adv0589,It would be very surprising if he made the team in year 1
adv0589,"I never paid for it but between games that make it on TV and the ever other week free game I only had to watch 1-2 games max on the shitty streams that have been my entire NFL watching life.

Seriously it probably isn't much worse then the official 200$ streaming package although I have never used that, chromecasted it to a 46 inch TV and it still looks good. "
adv0589,Do you realize what a shit show it would have been if a team were to spend a 4th or 5th on him and he sat out a year with no warning?
adv0589,"Think of that season as some sort of point guard season.

best offensive line by a huge margin. 

best running game in the league that drew all the attention

Probably the easiest to throw to WR in the NFL in Jackson, and a WR having a decent season when they already have the #1 CB committed to Desean, safety help on Desean and the Run game so he is getting at worst 1-1 coverage with a shitty CB. 

He literally took no risks, allowed the OL and Run game to carry the offense and took the wide open easy throws. 

Now he had some luck in there but at the time it seemed like this may be enough to get the job done if we beefed up the rest of the team, but yeah at no point was anyone watching that streak and going WOW THAT PASS or some shit. That offense would completely collapse when 1-2 things were taken away. 


For example when the Saints had a CB who could go 1-1 with Desean it freed up help for the run game and Cooper and the offense was nearly inept until that player got hurt and we went on a scoring spree. It was this year but the Seahawks basically run their defense like we try and force other teams to do it and it required Sanchez to make passes that weren't wide open and he did nothing. For this team to be able to beat good defenses we needed WRs and QBs who can beat tight coverage instead of hoping we get them confused or just flat out beat them from being superior. "
adv0589,"I don't think that is a loophole, there is no way dropkick is more accurate then the 32 yarder"
adv0589,"Washington was fairly good. They are still a ways out but a few of those guys should be really good players even though I may have gone different directions. I would have taken Williams, you should be able to build a line if you are a good front office and already have a top tier LT without spending top 5 picks on interior linemen. 

Giants were decent but Flowers at 9 is a stretch, but the 2nd/3rd round picks are good value. Pretty damn good draft, cant really poke holes anywhere other then over drafting Flowers which is honestly understandable. 

Cowboys is hard to analyze, Bryon Jones is a great prospect but I am not sure he is going to have an immediate impact. A good pick in the long term butt he may be better served sitting for awhile til he can win the job. Gregory is insane value at 60 but was a much better 3-4 prospect then a 4-3, he is going to have to bulk up quite a bit for the 4-3. 

It was a good draft in what they got for their defense early, but despite the ability of cowboys fans to convince themselves that RB was a bad position to draft they now have a top tier OL and hardly anybody to run behind it. Yes you have Randle,Williams Dunbar, and McFadden, but those are the exact type of teams that need to draft a RB. That is one of the worst groups in the NFL for a team that forced teams to play the run first against an offense with Dez Bryant and Romo. 

Great overall value in their draft for them, but i don't know how much better they will be next year when they didn't get one of the like 7 RBs in this draft and picked guys who are going to need time to adjust. But then again Jones could adjust quickly and Gregory tack on 15 Lbs here and they could nearly fix their defense in 1 draft. "
adv0589,"No? Its the logic used. 

Nobody is saying the front 7 will take a step back, or the ST will collapse, whatever you want to use as an excuse for it. Those are opinions that you can hold that make sense. 

Most of the reasons people think the Eagles are going to struggle deal directly with Bradford getting hurt and Sanchez playing(when he was the damn starter for the majority of the season last year and Foles sucked ass for 5-6 of the 7 games he was in there for). Swapping McCoy for a similar level RB when McCoy had his worst season as an Eagle last year etc.

Like imagine me going into some thread about another team and saying they will fall off because their QB of last season will be their QB this season. 

It is far from just this guy but look over the thread, ""it will get ugly if Bradford goes down"" etc, Sanchez was the starting QB for basically 9 games and Foles had very very very little to do with all wins outside of the Washington game where he was amazing. "
adv0589,So you take Graham and Stills out and add in a RB who was a second tier FA and your 2nd string guy and Hill steps up. How the fuck did you come to the conclusion that this is even in competition with last year alone. 
adv0589,"True, just different from a lot of these because that team picked up a ton of talent in between those years. Bruce missed half the season the year before, they traded for Faulk, drafted Holt early in the first, and they got Green in free agency.

Yes probably the biggest year to year turn around but how many teams from one year to the next basically add HOF level players at every skill position and a good QB in free agency lol. "
adv0589,"You act like Rodgers was some shock when he was good... 
"
adv0589,"...?

Lets explain this to you from your previous post.

He went 2-14 in 2013, why are you even bringing that up as an example of a D linemen player not being able to win MVP, not to mention a QB in the same season basically rewrote the record book. 

How is that even involved here. What possible argument can you even begin to form that a player on a team with the #1 pick deserved MVP over a QB with the GOAT statistical season?

Moving on to 2014. Rodgers had a great season, it would have won MVP in most years regardless of what anyone else did. Watt led a team that DID NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS, no player has won MVP on a non playoff team since '76. In addition to this no defensive player has won since '86 (which btw they were 14-2 with an amazing defense).

Now despite there being a great candidate in Rodgers who was on a great team, and being a defensive player on a non playoff team Watt still got 13 of the 50 votes and came in second far above the rest of the pack. 

If Rodgers had gone down week 12 or if Watt's team had gotten 11 wins, shit if the Houston defense alone had been a top 5 group on Watt's back he is probably MVP right now but people are going ""LOL IF HE DIDN'T WIN IT LAST YEAR HE NEVER WILL"". 

You can pretty much take it to the bank that Watt will get a MVP if he plays at this level for the next 4 years and his team becomes good. "
adv0589,Aside from the obvious Lebron answer I think Westbrook would be one of the better CBs in the league. 
adv0589,I think Randle wins the job and has the best season of the 4 easily. 
adv0589,"Wow that is a pretty good question. I would say it's pretty damn close, people are drastically underestimating the effect of an extra player. 

The ability to blitz every play without compromising the back end? Double coverage on both WRs? There is a lot going on here. "
adv0589,Yeah not even sure where you are trying to go with this at this point dude. 
adv0589,"Actually my projections are rather conservative as to what he could have ended up doing. 

Considering he had no preseason and had to get thrown in there to learn the first few weeks there is no way you can complain about a possible rookie wall. 

He didnt get over 60 yards in his first 3 games as he adjusted to the NFL, the season ended of him on a 4 game streak of 130+ yard games and a 190 yard game in week 17. 

"
adv0589,"Don't really agree, there are high upside players all over that offense. It's not going to happen but this isn't like the jags of last year or some shit if EVERYTHING went right they could be a good team. 

With some teams maybe but again they have a lot of players that individually COULD turn it around and if they all did it could be good, Sankey, DGB, Warmack, Hunter etc. "
adv0589,"&gt;How? He's been there for two seasons and when his starting QB went down the team got worse and missed the playoffs. You can't prove anything about consistency with 2 seasons in the NFL. Let's see what he does in 2015 after blowing up that roster.

Except you know the first year where he went like 7-1 with his backup QB and nearly beat the Saints in the playoffs. If we got a nice giftwraped bogus PI noncall to extend our chances we probably win that game too. 

I don't get how you can knock him for the backup QB thing when he still went 5-4 with Sanchez and the losses were to you GB and Seattle. 

Also why is Garrett getting the pass for only having 1 good season in 4 when Chip needs more time to play out with 2/2 good seasons hahaha


&gt;Chip is more about success right away, I'll give you that. He's still got that college mentality and I don't feel it's sustainable in the NFL. Garrett's process takes time, but we saw it payoff last season. I just see Garrett as more suited to the long term than Chip, which is what I'd prefer.


What are you even trying to say? Sustainable? 

Garrett's process is a bunch of BS, he was a legit bad coach until he seemed to get his head on straight this last year. Are you trying to argue that the 8-8 collapses year after year were just him gearing up for some run 4 years later when he probably already should have been fired?"
adv0589,Except trying to predict the turnover when putting things on paper is retarded. Not to mention plenty of that turnover is often a team that just missed the season before. 
adv0589,[Is this a serious comment...](http://img.pandawhale.com/52197-picard-double-facepalm-gif-Img-nP5f.gif)
adv0589,You realize he has had some bad drafts before right.. 2012 was a disaster 
adv0589,Bradley
adv0589,If someone with the name SpygateHernandez was a celebrity in disguise it would be absolutely hilarious 
adv0589,"Shocking, people stopped constantly saying he needs to stay healthy when he survived a 400+ carry season without injury and won OPOY. Why on earth would you think its weird that people changed their opinion on him from ""he has to stay healthy"" to a top 5 type guys after he stayed healthy...

Nowhere near as absurd as you guys sitting here always saying he is much better then we say before his best season and now pretending that he was expendable. "
adv0589,Dunno what you are debating here 2010 was easily the best he ever played. 
adv0589,"Its not a thing for any other position. 

Edit: Do you guys even know what the Dalton line is? Worst player that you aren't looking to replace? Half the damn people listed in this thread are either fringe starters or people that just got replaced/people are upset they weren't. No idea how this became some sort of ""who's average"" thing. "
adv0589,Rekt
adv0589,"Perhaps you don't understand.

He had games as the lead back with Murray hurt in 2013 as well.

Being behind a top offensive line with Romo and Dez petrifying defenses as the lead back is about as good of a situation you could ask for 

Hate to break it to you if you include the 9 carry game from 2013 well over half of his career carries are in these games and you are trying to basically say that getting 2-4 carries a game where he had a couple big runs is the better lens to view him through."
adv0589,"I was just saying it isn't going anywhere.

And again I don't think you understand the depth of this shit for him..

Like Immagine Strong is the best WR in the league in 5 years, Amari Cooper after injury plagued years finally is playing well and has a huge game on MNF. Strong goes out on twitter to say that he is better and Cooper sucks out of nowhere despite everyone already knowing that. That's the level Shady is at.

Doesn't bother me that much but he is unlike the rest. "
adv0589,"Don't really see your point. We have good weapons at TE/RB and Matthews +Agholor at WR, it's not like we have some deficiency of weapons. "
adv0589,"No but PFF is used in arguments, QBR gets brought up and people go insane instantly.  "
adv0589,I doubt he ever exclusively is. I think at best he plays outside in 2 WR sets and slides in when we put 3 out there. 
adv0589,"Note how i didn't say pro bowl. Again ET is well on his way to being an anchor of an all time great defense and an assortment of all pros. You LOL ET COMAPRED TO THE BIG 3 OF 2000s opinion will seem absurd in 2025 if his career plays out the way it has been. 

Not saying he is the GOAT or some shit but he CLEARLY is going to be an all time great player unless something changes. 

There might not be a single funnier thing to watch then people pass the praise around for the Seahawks 5 or so top tier impact players to try and form some argument that any one of them are not as good as they are. "
adv0589,I would guess the NFL rulebook
adv0589,"Then compare him to Johnson lol..

And I don't see the depth. All 3 of the teams I listed have a player drafted earlier then Shaq in the first round in the last 2 years as depth players and you are listing Shaq as a strong point. 

Not saying the Panthers aren't up there but it seems unfair to just say ""no contest"" when teams can match them 1-3 and then have 3-4 other very very good players/prospects. "
adv0589,"So we are supposed to view him solely on his last season? How does that make sense, there is a massive sample size with these players. "
adv0589,He probably wins it if they get 2 more wins last year with a bit better defense. 
adv0589,"How does that make sense to you after what you have said in this thread lmfao. No shit hes in the OPOY running 90% of people don't even consider him a comeback story. 

You literally just went all over this talking about how he is a prime CPOY candidate and then gave it up out of nowhere for someone saying he could win a different award that is not connected to it at all "
adv0589,"In all fairness he was never expected to do anything last year and almost every snap he got was out of position when we switched him like week 4.

But yes he is the easy #1 so far. I still hope he can be a long term piece but he is clearly never going to be a good first rounder. "
adv0589,"Hes a bit of a game breaker man, its a missing piece of your offense. I like OL there as well but it's not like lockett is worthless "
adv0589,"Shocking I know, but Foles isn't that good. 


And oh my god just reread that post, you can't possibly think that they made that trade with the hopes of trading up. "
adv0589,"Oh my god dude... People knocked the Romo extension because it had so little money in the first few years that it was obviously going to create the monster that it is now. Now he again restructured this offseason but the damage was done before and eventually there will be a year with a ton of gtd money in it where he has an obscene cap number.

You post makes no fucking sense becuase we are paying Murray 5m this year, Sproles is no longer on the books when it goes up to 8, neither is McCoy's dead money. You are adding up values that will never actually be reached. At no point in the next 5 years are we committed to even spending 13m on the RB position and you say 18. "
adv0589,"Yeah what, i totally agree with you 6-9 wins seems pretty likely while less then 5 absurd and 11+ being kinda the same way."
adv0589,... ok?
adv0589,"No he wasn't, and hes considered one of the higher floor players in the draft. That makes no sense"
adv0589,"This can't be real can it? How would he get 13M+ more then Luck/Clowney.

Yeah he deleted that tweet its 25m"
adv0589,"Thurmond suspended for weed like 16 months ago, Huff DUI, people have built up this classification for every player we get that does not exist. 

Cardinals preach the same shit and brought in Matthieu. "
adv0589,You need someone to explain to you why he was rated higher after the other guy missed a portion of the prior season?
adv0589,lol 3/4 players in the top 4 are hall of frame level players and the 3rd just missed it by not being able to win the superbowl/early retirement.  
adv0589,"i mean if you are going to pick a team out of the last few years they are not near the top of that list '13 Eagles, '14 Texans, '13 Chiefs, '13 Panthers, '12 Vikings, '12 Colts, '13 Cardinals, '12 Seahawks etc. 

The only reason the Cowboys projections were so low is because they had beat the positivity out of people on their talented roster by going 8-8 3 straight years with superbowl projections. They lost 2 players on defense and Romo was fresh off another back injury. 

It's hilarious how you guys can't go through this thread without getting butthurt about your team. There are like 10 better examples  in the last 3 years of suprising turn arounds and every single answer in this thread is Cowboys. "
adv0589,I would give like a 70% chance at least of the team being better with Fitz. He might be average at best but Geno could be one of the worst QBs in the NFL if he doesn't improve. 
adv0589,"Our defense is worlds ahead of where Dallas was last year. Also wat,  you guys very nearly lost to Dallas last year"
adv0589,Todays NFL is the easiest to adjust it has ever been 
adv0589,So you hope for no sacks til week 7
adv0589,"It really isn't. 

For all the hate it gets it paints a better picture then just about any standard stat. 

"
adv0589,I like how it's being painted this way. They are letting TY walk and bringing in Dorsett guys 
adv0589,"He is, my guess is this article is a bunch of BS about ""open competition"" and people thinking there are recovery concerns because chip never give anything to the media. The ONLY time someone has given a straight answer was Bradford when he first came here before he had gone behind the great wall of media blackout where he basically laughed off concerns of not being ready for camp"
adv0589,"I mean its a good sign for the Cowboys but its not like you look around the league and go ""WOW Cowboys are getting so much out of those rookie contracts!!""

Like an example of this making sense would be say the Colts, most of a good to great offense is rookie contracts and they were able to just go into free agency like Pacman Jones at the strip club and build a quality defense. Having 2 guards and a RT under 18m isn't exactly some amazing feat. 

"
adv0589,"This is solid gold at this point. 

"
adv0589,"Yes but the relative importance of a good amount of Foles turnovers (2 in the Giants game with the team up 24-0, a heave at the end of the half vs indy etc ) and his weird ability to pull it together late and take hardly any actual sacks despite an obscene amount of hurries and pressures will bear that out.

There were a lot of things that didn't show up on that stat sheet that he did fairly well which leads to that. 

I think Flacco is your posterboy. No other stat I can find will lead to him being a top 10 type guy. 

Note that it also did a very very good job or rating Foles in 2013 where any other stat would have been off the charts but QBR tempered that. "
adv0589,yeah lol Teddy could just as easily be out of the league before Rodgers as he could be some guy who plays to 35 and makes a ton of pro bowls.. 
adv0589,Its hilarious that the Pats fans don't get that this just means no smoking gun but they did it. 
adv0589,"I think the idea is even if you get through the weaker AFC you would be massive underdogs vs the top 3 or so NFC teams. Now obviously anything can happen but NE, SEA, GB, and to a lesser extent DAL all have what I would view as better rosters. "
adv0589,Yes one single game that kinda fudged the system makes it worthless.... 
adv0589,Jason LaCanfora and ESP lmfao. 
adv0589,"So many naive comments on this ""just comming in to help"" things. Most police investigations if they truly had zero doubt he was involved would just do that over the phone or something. They flew him down there and said they were not ready to question him yet. "
adv0589,Buckhalter was having an amazing game and then went down with an injury that kept him out for the whole next season right before halftime IIRC and it just completely killed the Eagles. 
adv0589,Did people expect different lol
adv0589,Yes taking a switch to a 4 year old so hard that he bleeds and gets cuts on his ballsack over a something that he did in a video game to his other brother seems like normal parenting. 
adv0589,Did you think anyone was going to read this man 
adv0589,Faulk was like the #2 RB in the game with Sanders retiring and when Davis went down with injury was easily the best. The guy was a top 2 pick a few years prior and just had a 2300 yard season on a terrible team. Bruce was one of the best WRs in the league just had a few injury issues etc. 
adv0589,"Dunno bout the rest of you guys but I think we got 2 good players that are great fits at our 2 biggest areas of need in the first 2 rounds. 

Sure other teams have better overall players and whatnot but I don't think we could have done anything better in round 1/2"
adv0589,He was their 6th rated 4-3 OLB what did you expect
adv0589,"Not saying Eli did nothing or anything, but to pretend that defense wasn't very good in the playoffs is absurd"
adv0589,"I don't get what the issue is in understanding here for so many of you. He isn't a suspect but he also isn't not a suspect if you know what I mean. 

Police saying he is not a suspect at this time does not mean they think he had nothing to do with it. "
adv0589,"&gt;I say give all quarterbacks 3 years before deciding a verdict, and Geno has no excuses next season. But to completely write him off considering his situation last year is absolutely ludicrous.

And to that I say ok take that risk, but I will point out that the only 2 players in the NFL who started their career off anywhere near this poorly and ended up becoming more then a solid backup were both #1 overall picks. "
adv0589,"LOL, because he has no side. Vikings did what any team would have done and even caught some flack at the start for not doing it. 

Flat out Peterson thinks he did nothing wrong, he has done the absolute minimum to get back into the league and seems to think the vikings are at fault for not being as delusional as him. He was practically bragging about the fucking ordeal until he realized that there was massive backlash against him, and he took this as some sort of fucking unnecessary test from god rather than going hmmm maybe I shouldn't hit my kids to the point that they ar bloody at 4 years old.  "
adv0589,"Lol, remember Titans fans laughing at how Marcus was getting mocked to them because Mett was their guy "
adv0589,It's almost as if every dynasty paired similar legendary HC and QB combos... 
adv0589,"It's only acceptable with Aaron Donald and Mack, get with the fucking program here. "
adv0589,There is no way you think he goes undrafted man. Like do you think someone could call them up with someone they drafted in the 3rd right now and sling a trade with Jax?
adv0589,"He likes versatility there, maybe he isn't crazy about 511 but I don't know where this size thing came from"
adv0589,"Except nobody watched Foles and was wowed by what they saw. They were going how is this guy with a B arm and C accuracy and zero mobility putting up these numbers. If you made players a generic look and put OBJ next to any WR in the league last year on the eye test and stats he was the best WR in the NFL, if you showed Foles throwing next to Rodgers nobody would come to that same conclusion. "
adv0589,"I am not arguing that. But you have to be a certain quality team to win, they had that team for like 6 straight years at least and although winning 2 you can't just simply ignore the extreme  under performance in the others. 

Seriously 11-1, player shoots himself totally implode. Yes the plaxico situation sucked but is that really an excuse for going 1-3 and losing the first playoff game. Some of that is coaching. Then there was a disappointing 8-8 season. Missed the playoffs in 2010 when they literally had the division wrapped up and gave up a 21 point lead in 8 minutes left in the 4th. 2012 they again looked like one of if not the best teams in the league, came out of the gates firing and then just straight up shit the bed with a 3-7 finish. "
adv0589,"His agent has had permission to seek a trade for both of the last 2 offseasons because he isn't happy with his contract. This is such a non story, and was not even a serious comment."
adv0589,"Yes, if he says gets 5 yards off a huge hole and goes down on first contact it's basically ""doing your job"" after the OL opened it. If say he then jukes a player down the field and breaks a tackle as well Murray would get points for that but not for the original part where the OL was the main part. 

There can be some 80 yard run by a RB that is basically nothing to PFF because he just ran down the sideline after good original blocking and a bad defense called. "
adv0589,ITT people actually being surprised that he had the charges dropped when we have known for like a full year that he would have the charges dropped if he completed the program. 
adv0589,Nothing is more painful the the 5-12 yards at a time Brady surgical destruction. 
adv0589,"He hasn't had serious injuries, that's absurd to act like his knee is a ticking time bomb... and we have the best backup in the league. "
adv0589,"Its not saying you are declining if we state the obvious fact that the two divisions you faced were brutally bad. 

Cut it any way you want it, before we even discuss their lack of top end talent outside of the Colts look no further then the draft where we saw those 2 divisions with the top 3 picks. "
adv0589,yeah happened like yesterday
adv0589,"Just basic fandom, just like how the Eagles fans were super worried about the CB2 and 2nd safety but now think the 6 guys fighting for the 2 spots are sure to lead to good starters.

You go back to January and ask Cowboy fans if they would be cool with letting Murray walk over 1m~ and go with Darren Mcfadden as the only addition they would have said no way it happens. 

When Mcfadden got signed the entire thread is fans saying he is just a depth signing and there is no risk to it etc, the second that no RB was drafted by the 3rd round it was laughable to think that the current RB situation wasn't set from the same people who were angry people thought Mcfadden would be the starter. "
adv0589,Ah you mean like last season when Sanchez started more games then Foles and we went 10-6 behind a worse defense?
adv0589,"He is also throwing away 500k~ in his first year earnings dude, even if he obliterated his knee he is a guy who had first round talent. No team is going to have a first round talent tackle on the league minimum contract and give up on him after 1 injury.  "
adv0589,This is almost as absurd as Bernie Williams retiring a few weeks ago 
adv0589,Pretty sure this implies the total yard and TD record along with YPC as well
adv0589,"They played an abysmal schedule and struggled the whole way. The only reason they even made the playoffs IMO is the fact they won the year before so had ""proven"" themselves vs top tier talent. 

The first real top tier team they faced nearly doubled them up in what may have been Winstons best game of the season. 

Also to be clear FSU was the #3 seed in the bracket so it is no guarantee they would have been in the NC game"
adv0589,"Despite what everyone says, the best situation for someone like him is a low risk situation where he can get to his next contract. Sure the Bills pencil him in day 1 as a starter and he may choose that.

But come here, play guard between one of the best C and RT players in the game and learn from some of the best players around. In 2 years when Peters retires you swap over to Tackle and will have a safe ass path to a big payday when compared to some of these teams that just desperately need a tackle. 

I doubt we are a front runner for it, but we would be one of the top few situations for his future success. Going to a team where he is the ""savior"" and making UDFA money is not a good long term move for him. "
adv0589,"Pretty sure you can do worse then 20 games in 2 seasons, he could go 0-16 next season and he would probably get another job without personnel control. "
adv0589,"Strong locker room where he wasn't required to do anything and able to grow his weak mechanics for a few years would be far better. I think that's a terrible fit, a team with an immediate need for him without a great lockerroom is a disaster. "
adv0589,"Davis is a worlds better defender, better rebounder, similar level offensive player and only worse at passing ability.

Davis could easily be the #2 player in the NBA next year.

You talk about his lack of an offensive game while just blatantly ignoring the fact that he was a top 5 scoring player in the NBA last season, got 32 PPG in the playoffs and has poor spacing from the rest of his team. 

He is fresh off one of the best PER seasons of all time and it doesn't even account for the fact that he is quite possibly the most impactful defender in the NBA. "
adv0589,That is a direct quote from a player lol
adv0589,"Exactly, its a good run game. Nobody is going to sit here and go LOL they can't run the ball.

Are they going to run for 100 yards for every game until their QB is hurt and they play the #1 run defense in the same game? Hell fucking no. 

It would be so funny if we could travel to some alternate universe where the eagles shipped McCoy, brought in Mcfadden to pair with Polk and Sproles behind our OL and see what the reaction would be from the Cowboys fans to the Eagles homers going ""LOL OL&gt;RB YOU WILL SEE"" "
adv0589,They are one Luck injury from the playoffs. 
adv0589,"He was at the top of the league until the end of the season when he got worn down by having 400 fucking carries lol...

You guys have to keep in mind that Murray is the type of RB that would have big before contact numbers even with a trash OL. Someone who tries to put their shoulder down and run through someone for an extra 2 yards is never going to have more YAC then a Jamal Charles Chris Johnson McCoy etc. "
adv0589,"Is that an option?

He is never going in the first round.

If he sits out it will make him look like he doesn't love football, and he will have sat out a year. 

He isn't going for a 4m signing bonus he is looking at 500K and then near league minimum salary after that in the 3rd. "
adv0589,"I think we are literally the perfect team for him long term. Immediate starters position at RG, in between 2 pro bowl level players, and probably the best technical LT in the league to learn from. 

Peters retires in 2 years Johnson slides over to LT, Collins to RT and he has a year to prove he can handle Tackle and get the big money for his upcoming contract. 

It's not the flashiest deal out there for him but nobody else has that good of a situation to present. 

But apparently he loves the Saints and teams will throw day 1 starter LT positions at him and he might let those types of things influence him. I don't expect it at all but it would be a savvy move by him. Our line would be ABSURD and he would get all kinds of overrating done to his play. "
adv0589,What has Tannehil proven that Bradford hasn't other then staying on the field the last 2 seasons lol
adv0589,"Legendarily misinformed post hahaha.

Not to mention the whole damn power struggle happened when our GM tried to flex his muscles and get rid of a guy chip liked in the FO  and chip went to war over it. 

I wonder if he knows his team just brought in a new coach, GM and fired all their scouting department as well.."
adv0589,"So 32-9 3900 yard pace with Tavon Austin who is practically a bust being your only weapon instead of Laundry and Wallace is worse then 4k 27-12? That is enough for you to say that he has somehow not even made this a discussion based on play?

Again Tannehil is the clear choice based on health, but that is not what we are talking about.. 

News flash Bradford had a terrible 2011 season he came into the league on a 1-15 team with zero talent on offense, and they still have nearly identical stats over 49 and 48 games.

It is literally fucking absurd to sit there and go one is CLEARLY better when in the same number of games they are within 200 yards passing of eachother, Tannehil has 4 more TDs and 4 more ints. And when they were playing at nearly identical levels statistically when we last saw them. "

Still plenty of people will go down in preseason and the true impact of rookies at this point etc is hard to judge. "
adv0589,"lol...

And there is where I point out that I was not the OP, and you responded to a post that was mainly agreeing with what was said before. "
adv0589,"I must have missed Romo playing in Buffalo on a losing team!

And yes hate to break it to you if Romo was some #1 overall pick the opinion of him probably would be much higher.

No offense but he fact that people think Smith is a better or even level player right now is proof of where draft pick and location can effect someones view of a player. Smith is a great player, probably #3 in the league but Thomas and Peters are better right now.  

Same reason that Martin is the next god tier G in everyones mind and the best rookie guard in years, while Bitonio was just as good last year. Dallas vs Cleveland, first round vs second round, winning team vs losing team etc. "
adv0589,Bradford and RG3 won ROY off the top of my head in the last 5 seasons
adv0589,Luck at 25 or whatever he is with his ability to run would probably be the best option. 
adv0589,lol like 90% of the linemen in the league played LT at their school 
adv0589,"I don't believe everyone else should feel that way, but BB is the only coach I would not have to think long and hard about swapping for Kelly. "
adv0589,"Mariota was never the plan man, I am sure he inquired on the price tag but he decided not to go all out to get him back in FA by trading for bradford. "
adv0589,"Can't ignore the basic facts. 

Non playoff team.

Incredible season from a QB.

Still got a good section of votes. 

If Rodgers didn't go absolutely ham last season or if Watt had won 13 games on a great defense he wins the fucking MVP. It's just flat out stupid to pretend that a defensive player on a non playoff team that STILL GOT A GOOD SECTION OF VOTES not winning is proof that he can't win it. 

Not to even mention the absurdity of you complaining about AP's mvp in 2012 it was the clear choice. "
adv0589,Yeah but we also don't look back into 1890 when looking for baseball greats. By 1920 or so Baseball was well on its way to what it is today. 
adv0589,"Clearly does not qualify lol

It never ceases to amaze me how opinions like this can slip though. I mean every ""CPOY favorite"" thread for the last 3 months has had a vikings fan at the bottom who got downvoted for saying AP and then shit like this happens where everyone thinks he qualifies "
adv0589,Find out Saturday. 
adv0589,Well to be fair the #2 guy only played 9 games and had about the same overall score/snap. But yes probably best G in game
adv0589,"Sooo?

Now the cuttoff is top 10, when it was described as ""historically bad"" in the previous post lol. 

There was an very high powered offense led by Romo and a great group of weapons and we are supposed to go ""well the defense was only 13th that year so its fine that they did nothing"""
adv0589,"Its 11m, and included in that is Sproles who is the best returner in the NFL and basically a pass catcher. 

What you guys just miss is that because you had a top tier line and a top tier RB last year your offense put teams in this awful position of having to try and cover the run with Dez Romo Witten etc on the field. Yes you may even still have a great productive run game but your team is soooo much easier to defend now, the days of down 14 points in the 2nd quarter and running the ball to keep the pass game open are over. 

You could easily have 1200 yards rushing among the top 2 guys or some shit, the point is that if you get reduced production against 7 man boxes instead of 8 you had a massive drop off. "
adv0589,.
adv0589,"Sanchez was good enough in the preseason to drum up a QB controversy. Keep in mind Bradford played in a similar up tempo offense in college. 

Anyways you are missing the point here, he can struggle to acclimate to the offense if that's your argument. We went 10-6 with a combined stat line of 84.8 QB rating 27 turnovers from the QB position last year.  I am not sitting here guaranteeing some 12-4 record or some shit, but us falling off is almost certainly going to have to be about far more then the new acquisitions flopping as the guys that went out beside Maclin did jack shit last year. "
adv0589,Depends where you cut it off. Charles Peterson Lynch Bell seem to be above him while him and MCCoy are right there and ahead of the rest of the league by a decent margin. 
adv0589,"Yeah nobody thought this wasn't funny or anything, its just those pesky mad patriot fans again!!"
adv0589,"I don't think its a bad move, but he has to go somewhere with a already stacked line to have starting as a G pay off long term. "
adv0589,"Mathis and Yanda, don't think its much of a debate. "
adv0589,"If you are talking actually vs eachother and not the quality of the team based vs their era the Lions would crush them.

As bad as the Lions were you directly place that team in '76 and they would be one of the better teams. "
adv0589,"Is water wet? 

"
adv0589,"Yeah the fact that he has been so effective off the bat when he was that much of a ""workout warrior"" type has us excited"
adv0589,I am commenting specially on the statement you made. 82 rushes with stats incredibly boosted by a single run does not mean you have some sure thing to brag about
adv0589,"No, it just isn't. 

The article is about whether Bradford could defy concerns about his health coming into a new high powered offense with a offensive guru head coach and turn into a franchise cornerstone for the Eagles. Like Brees did for the Saints. In asking if Sam bradford could be the Eagles version of Brees there is almost no implication that they are saying that Bradford is headed to the HOF on the first ballot. 

Also the damn guy is one of the 5-7 best QB prospects of the last 15 years and showed promise albeit in a talentless black hole of a team on offense. You guys talk about him like he's Dalton or some shit talent wise here. There is a reason the guy still had first round type trade value with a bad contract after missing 2 seasons in a row. "
adv0589,"I think their line of thought was more we built our entire defense through the free agent market, we are going to have to make the D even worse or let some of the guys up for contract up next year. 

Keep in mind they had Andre Johnson Ty Hilton and Moncrief already. Sure it makes a difference to have Dorsett but that is a pure luxury pick on a team with some big holes to fill and players like Brown Collins etc who are very good fits there. 

I wonder if they are looking to trade TY right now, It would be so weird for them to actually have both in long term plans. "
adv0589,"I mean I guess, that doesn't mean much though... Seahawks dropped their pants and took a dump on the packers early in the season last year and were in a dogfight in the NFCCG. And even thought there was a ST TD by Seattle it took an incredible play to extend a drive to win that game by dallas. "
adv0589,"Again simply responding to 

&gt;no run game lol. Never heard of Latavious Murray?
"
adv0589,They both blow in it 
adv0589,Yes the people who have done zero looking in to it to the point that they seriously think it was a non contact injury are the ones we need to be listening to. 
adv0589,"Cole is pretty good still, just had what was probably a better player behind him and was making 12m. We tried to renegotiate but apparently he wanted more then we would offer "
adv0589,[mmm](https://31.media.tumblr.com/2116fb219b6ce405fe018526d03e24cd/tumblr_inline_n04pnju70O1ssbkkq.jpg)
adv0589,Which is due to Brady not cooperating which is not going to go over well with the NFL
adv0589,Still makes no sense
adv0589,"Bro if you didn't scrape some wins against the division you would have earned the #1 overall pick 2 years in a row. 

You have made the playoffs like twice in the 15 years I have been following football, god forbid we don't include you in the division favorite conversation. "
adv0589,"Ehhh Such is a better player at a higher paid position. 

Suh's contract was 100% anticipating the increased cap when they signed him to it "
adv0589,"No no pretty sure he meant Riley 

Expect a GOAT tier season from the ol hard R"
adv0589,"You think correctly placing 55 players with a team at an exact pick is ""good"" 

That is like seeing someone did 5 straight 100% perfect NCAA brackets and going ""hmm thats decent"".

One single oddball pick and literally fuck up 10+ selections even if you were right in the first place. 

If the Jags take Williams, Fowler goes at 5, White is probably going at 7, Scherff makes it to the Giants etc. One single pick fucked up the projections for the entire top 10 and once you are out of that its really fucking hard to get many right. "
adv0589,"I don't get that though he missed 6 games of 55 to start his career then had the double ACL tear. If his ACL is intact which is a if but also not some certainty as is often implied around here I don't see where the LOL WEEK 5 HE GONE shit comes form.

Having one injury behind a putrid OL in 4 years of play isn't really injury prone. 

Hey guys, since apparently this is too hard for you, look at the posts it is in response to and the points it is making counter points to before going LOL BUT HE HAD ACL TEARS THE LAST 2 YEARS BRO. "
adv0589,He was already one of the best players of all time... It would be like if JJ Watt left the texans at the end of his contract and went elsewhere for 6 years and someone asked 20 years from now if it hurts knowing he went on to be great. 
adv0589,There is a difference between not being a slam dunk first round pick year 1 contributor and not being an asset as a backup OLB
adv0589,"Never wanted to do the deal anyways, and no I have been arguing for 2 months the Titans would have downs to not pick Mariota because they have mett "
adv0589,http://i.imgur.com/U7Ghu2s.gif
adv0589,"Ryan Williams had 2.8 ypc in the 5 games he has played since his rookie year in 2011... 

Like you have 4 decent backs but only 1 is out there at a time and almost every team in the league has at least 1 and a few have 2 better players then everyone on there. Like people reference the Pats RBBC, but those were 3 actually good players, you have a RBBC because none of the players have proven they are good enough to be starters. "
adv0589,"Washington is a massive market..

Washington might be the second most desirable team for the NFL to have in the superbowl from the NFC."
adv0589,Sort QB by any single metric that is on the normal sites and tell me which one gives the best indication of the players play the season before. 
adv0589,"I simply answered the question. Mariota dropping to 6 or being traded up for and coming in with a great year is the only real chance you had at the superbowl outside of some absurd scenario. 

Continuing on with that unless you find a way to use all 3 at the same time you are probably trading a player that for next year will be better then Williams or drafted a player that will be in a rotation. No matter how you feel about the move long term it clearly was not the best move for success this year. 

The superbowl odds makers aren't retarded they were building draft scenarios in to those odds, and that was in the prime ""mock Mariota to 6"" days. If he came in with a RG3/Wilson type rookie year you would probably have been one of the better teams in the league. 

I guarantee if he dropped to 6 or you traded up for him your Odds would be at like 40/1+ it's just we basically know now for sure you are dragging an anchor at the QB position. "
adv0589,"I think that's the opposite, he may be right. Although i gotta say I don't think he'd do this. Its not like teams are going to scramble for him in the first next year if he sits out a year "
adv0589,"Eye test, are you kidding me dude.. What is ESPN supposed to start listing the eye test rating on their site, obviously watching someone play and viewing everything is the best thing to do....

And yes that helped but he had 3 other 110~+ type games. The point is QBR was able to sort that out while passer rating had him top 10 in the league. "
adv0589,"Well I think just for the future potential they would offer him some sort of starting spot, but LG does not seem where he would want to be so are they just going to ditch a solid RT in the middle of the championship window for a rookie?

Props if Jerry pulls it off but it seems like such a weird fit. "
adv0589,"Visits Eagles sub, complains about Eagles fans caring about Dallas so much. Seems legit "
adv0589,"It's quite obvious in their play. First off the Eagles offense will probably have the best player he has ever had at a position at at least 9 positions. and Foles 2013 may honestly be the most overrated stretch of play in NFL hsitory. Teams were stacking the box to stop McCoy, Kelly was getting people wide open and he didn't take many risks. Look at the shit he isn't throwing into tight windows or anything every pass the WR is wide open..

The Saints had a CB who could cover Jackson 1-1 and the entire offense shut down. He had to carry the offense early last year to some degree instead of just a piece in the offense and he crumbled. "
adv0589,"Orlando area, Tampa by far the closest. Bortles is god "
adv0589,"They drafted offense in both of the first 2 rounds last year. They have a decent TE and a decent #2 WR. If they hit on a lineman or WR here in with the next pick they are 1 draft away from getting there. 

The thought that it was dumb to draft a QB with a high pick is kinda absurd. Chargers/Giants with Rivers/Eli were terrible, colts were terrible in 2012, Bucs are pretty damn bad, Falcons were terrible in 2008, Lions were TERRIBLE when they drafted stafford, Rams were one of the worst teams in recent memory when they got Bradford and they went 7-9 the next year with him etc. "
adv0589,"Yeah dunno what we are using here but I am taking Suh in the very least over either one of them. 

You easily have the best line if we are not going to deduct for it only being 3 players, but there is no way wilkerson and Richardson were 2 of the best 3 overall linemen in the entire NFL outside of Watt. "
adv0589,IIRC they already declined right?
adv0589,I think there is at least a decent chance at RT/LG
adv0589,"I thought so but people are still bringing it up, OP mentioned that something like the ints were drops so it should have been 14/17 with no ints instead of 12/17 with 2 or some shit lower in the thread and whatnot as well. 

Anyways yeah just because it spits out some strange answers does not mean that it isn't a good single statistic. And at the same time that doesn't mean that viewing all of them is not a much better path as well. "
adv0589,"Lol go to ESPN and sort by any statistic that gives a better picture then QBR. Look at this list and compare to QB rating, which one looks like it has a better grip on the situation. "
adv0589,... what
adv0589,He has work ethic type/ attitude concerns. 
adv0589,"yes?

You take a step back.

https://www.sportsbook.ag/sbk/sportsbook4/nfl-betting/2016-nfl-futures-2016-nfl-divisions.sbk

Do you really think the rest of the division is being genuine in predicting that we will finish 6-10 when we are very very close to co favorites objectively?"
adv0589,"Their day 3s are all over the place... We traded our 4th for a future 3rd, had no 5th and drafted the BPA on the damn NFL.com list who they had a 3rd-4th round grade on in the 6th and they give us a D with no explanation. 

My guess is yours got shit on because of the no RB thing though, still an F is absurd. "
adv0589,"They are the obvious ""hope for""picks, I'm just not getting too excited because I dunno if they make it to 42 let alone 52. 

I just hope we end up with one of Fisher Rowe Rollins or J Collins "
adv0589,"You are just having a massive skip in logic lmao. First off this peppers and Willaims duo is going to the like 4 time defending super bowl champions, who were one of the best teams with zero contribution from these 2 imaginary players. There are more guys coming in of equal talent every year. You can pay these players and say you trade Peppers in his prime for a first round pick and just keep the cycle going. 

You are literally trying to argue that a team can have too many assets. It for whatever reason sounds palatable to you now but something tells me after the Pats of the 2000s or the Seahawks of today win 13 of 15 superbowls with multiple perfect seasons you would start to question it. "
adv0589,That and Kiffin was just awful. 
adv0589,mhm
adv0589,"2012 because we had like the 5th best SB odds, started out 3-1 beat the defending champs in prime time and then didn't win til like fucking week 15"
adv0589,"His post said literally nothing about Tannehil, you simply saw Bradford has a lot of heart and decided it was some personal attack on Ryan.

If a post about Favre vs Peyton came up and someone said Favre had so much heart would you be in there like OMFG IDIOT PEYTON HAD SO MUCH HEART "
adv0589,It's funny because someone actually believed this yesterday 
adv0589,I feel like that entire scenario you just said was made up. Packers were one of the most hyped up 6 seeds I can remember and Rodgers was not being listed as some reason they wouldn't win..
adv0589,"Ok but that rushing yards amount at the time Van Buren retired had him as the all time leading rushing yard leader in all of the NFL, while McCoy is getting traded for his contract size. 

2 time champion. 5 time all pro in a short career. The fact that in 1944-1951 when stats were far far harder to come by he put up 5 less yards a game then McCoy is a huge credit to him. 

Again you can make some argument that if you put him in today's NFL he might not be better then McCoy, but you are talking about someone that took the NFL rushing record and nearly doubled it and earned a position on the 75th anniversery team. 
"
adv0589,"Drafts over boys, back to full blown off season"
adv0589,"Same record? We had a first place schedule instead of a last place and Sanchez had to face you twice and GB in GB along with Seattle. 

I think we got enough of what your team would do with a QB injury when Arizona blew the doors off you at home, unfortunately we weren't lucky enough to have our QB out for only 2 games with one being against Jacksonville. "
adv0589,"First off you have to list what WR you would want over him at 5. If you like the Giants better on paper if they swapped out say Cobb or Fitz etc you are insane. 

Second he has shown he can do it. There was zero hesitation with Josh Gordon last year when he had a so so first season and then broke out but since OBJ broke out his first year we have to be cautious with him?

His projections were a 121 catches 1750 yard 16 TD season last year if he played all 16. Honestly forget rookie, how many players have had that good of a season at WR ever?"
adv0589,Yeah I hope they just go back to normal 
adv0589,"I think the point is your run game will be fine, but with Murray you were able to pair a top RB with a top line. 

The absurd ability to keep defenses playing the run with Romo+Dez made your offense so hard to cover last year. That being said obviously you still have tons of offensive talent and will be one of the best, and the defensive upgrades could easily make the team better next year. "
adv0589,"How is a 7 year vet unprroven. He isn't some top tier CB and a clear downgrade from Maxwell but Willaims is a pretty damn good CB when we are talking #2s. Hes never going to shut down top tier elusive WRs with no safety help but as a #2 with ET backing him up he is going to have a very good season. 

Note how I am not going to shit on people for putting them ahead of other power duos  but Kareem Jackson and Joseph come on now. "
adv0589,"What does specific players have to do with this?

I don't understand what you mean by this at all.. 

7 CBs are higher paid then the highest safety, we consistently see CBs all over the top 20 pick when only special safety prospects make it in there.

If you don't like the S/CB comparison find another single example of draft position/top tier pay that is misleading on their worth. "
adv0589,"There are a few worries though, you are sitting him in a meeting room with Hardy and he is much more suited to 3-4 instead of 4-3. Still cowboys have experience doing this kind of off the field shit he needs. "
adv0589,"True but you beat the Bengals, Broncos with hurt manning when they were not very good, and then got obliterated by the first team you faced. There is more to it then you let on there. 

Wouldn't shock me to see you in the SB, but barring some cinderella run out of the NFC you will be big underdogs. "
adv0589,"You guys can cut it however you want. You have a bottom 10 RB situation on a team that just spent 3 first round picks on OL to build up a clock control machine. 

You want a strong comp to what you have from last season? The Browns. They had a bunch of meh backs behind a line with 3 all pro level players, and ran the ball decently but were far from unstoppable. 

Perhaps Jones progresses quickly and Gregory can get his shit together and tack on 30 lbs and perhaps Sean lee can make it through the preseason and your defense will be good enough to not need a clock control monster like it did last year but a trade up in the 3rd instead of reaching on a OL backup for a quality back would make your team much much better on paper. 

We have a similar skilled line to yours, what would you be saying if we let McCoy walk and were walking all over these threads talking about how Polk is a talented back we didn't need a replacement. "
adv0589,"Yeah few days late here, but we completely shut down, Lynch, Murray twice, and Foster.

Our run D is one of the best in the league that that was with the likes of Casey Matthews in there for almost the entire season. Cox and Thorton are 2 of the absolute best run defense DEs in the NFL"
adv0589,"Its hard to say, but yes his current issues go far far beyond the leg "
adv0589,I like how the responses that actually know how Sherman plays get downvoted while this gets upvoted... 
adv0589,"So lets get this straight, he isn't the best deep threat home run guy because that's all he does?"
adv0589,The worst part is my girlfriend of 6 years works at UCF and I live not 2 minutes from the campus... Imma just blame it on my fingers being too fast for my laptop keyboard  
adv0589,"I just think if you take a step back, GB has an easier division, a better defense, a better home field advantage and a better offense now with Murray gone. Again Cowboys are up there but I just think its hard to call GB better on paper right now unless you are very high on Dallas. 

I suppose you are right on the upside of the first 2 picks, but I see them as players who will be nice next year but their best days will be in future seasons. Gregory is going to have to tack a ton of weight on for the 4-3 and Jones at least when we thought he was coming here we viewed as a guy you let sit for half a season. "
adv0589,"&gt;Reasons we would not sign Ray Rice: he fell of the RB performance cliff

I like how you guys can say this so easily with other RBs but McFadden is a diamond in the rough who surely was limited to 3.3 yards per carry because of the Oakland line when quality RBs can get at least 4 all the time behind crap lines. "
adv0589,"Doesn't surprise me looks like with that roster he was just looking for the best player. 

They just picked a guy who will either be a RT or G in their system at 5th overall. "
adv0589,Why not strong tho
adv0589,"Still would be the best RB on your team though. 

Headache is not worth the player seen in 2013 however. "
adv0589,"That's not really the contract. Hardy makes insane cash per game. 

There are incentives but if he plays 16 games that contract is like 12-13m"
adv0589,"I dunno what the fuck happened but in that first game last year he looked like a absolute stud. 

Like not some 5 wide open pass bullshit or something he was legit carving us up with perfect passes. "
adv0589,"Oh my god it was praising Bradford, explaining thing about him in STL. IT had nothing to do with Ryan...


Alright guys I get it, the post which clearly was not meant to offend you in any way but you have somehow twisted into some sort of slight deserves your little downvote brigade because you can't see what he was trying to say "
adv0589,Not at all lol.. People expected Gronk to have the season he did if he remained healthy. McClain was totally out of football and one of the biggest busts in recent memory and had a great season out of nowhere. 
adv0589,"Yeah ""lol"" 

What is your rebuttal to that.

You view that as so fucking dumb, now you know how other people feel about your ""RBBC we are cool"" shit. "
adv0589,"Over thinking this way too much Charles was hurt last year.

In 2013 It was McCoy Lynch Charles all in the like 8-11 range "
adv0589,Vick's brutally slow reads and touch probably were never a great fit here. 
adv0589,"Oh lord I don't even know what to say to you hahahaha

Mathews makes 2m this year, Murray 5, sproles 4.1. McCoy is irrelevant at this point. 

Its hilarious that you guys all look at his overall contract like we overpaid Murray when we basically signed him to a 22/3 year deal. "
adv0589,Because he played DE at Clemson?
adv0589,"He has an unjust tag as a choker despite winning every ""win or go home"" game he has played well in for basically his entire career until GB this year, and playing flat out painfully in some of their losses. "
adv0589,Interesting flair to make that claim 
adv0589,Does.. Does he have 2 knees
adv0589,"You are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too caught up in the anti RB hype. 

Obviously he isn't some top 5 guy but RBs value has much more to do with the amount of injuries these guys often get that derails their careers and the much shorter life span of a RB in the nfl. 

Trying to argue that the Seahawks are similarly fucked if Lynch and Irvin go out is just absurd though, and Lynch is paid more then Graham for a reason. "
adv0589,Having Rodgers as your QB
adv0589,"Don't see it, Rodgers just lost a good section of votes to Watt when he had an amazing year and Watt didn't even make the playoffs. If anything last year should tell you guys that a defensive player could win MVP fairly easily. "
adv0589,That comment was not some team wide philosophy it was referring to CB/WR maybe the lines. Positions like safety ILB etc it has always been about versatility. 
adv0589,"Except Evans and Cooper have similar level talent, so him proving himself is relevant?"
adv0589,"Rice is like the same thing as DMC except far far more likely to pan out.

Like all the injury excuses and whatnot aside he just finished his first 16 game season in 7 years and averaged 3.4 ypc with a 25 yard long run as a ""home run"" type runner. 

Rice proved that he is a top tier back and had 1 single bad season. It is far far more likely that Rice turns his career around after a injury plagued season behind a bad OL then it is for McFadden who has 1 good season our of 7 and 3 recent putrid years. "
adv0589,"You are getting better but are still pretty damn bad no offense man. I think people that are predicting you go go to 7-8 wins are hitting the absolute peak of your upside. 

Just throwing it out there I don't think you are the favorite but you certainly have the potential to flop hard."
adv0589,"lol, his play coincides with the team's play. Say whatever you want but as your team slipped to irrelevancy last season so did his level of play. 

DRC wasn't really terrible here as you imply he was let go because when we were going 4-12 he didn't put the effort in. 

There id a reason Doesn't Really Care became his nickname and not some nickname about his play. It's not some surprise that he went to a superbowl contender and played lights out the next year. 

To be clear he isn't a bad player when he steps it down but he clearly stops running plays out etc at a certain point. "
adv0589,You could make the argument that every single unit on the Jets including QB is better aside from maybe RB for a quick example. 
adv0589,Wayyyy closer to Tampa here. Like if you are in western Orlando it's like 90m. Jacksonville is a good 2.5-3 hours but yeah 
adv0589,"Its a weird situation, i get how it happened. But most teams dont have 2 top 10 type TEs like us. Huff hardly hit the field (200 total snaps and a lot of that was us just trying to replace cooper later on in the season) and Ertz had 600 snaps.

Just saying it leaves off PFFs 5th highest graded TE(and the higest PFF grade of all eagles non linemen offensive players) for a 4th WR when Ertz was used as the ""4th WR"" for a good portion of the season. Anyways obviously don't expect you to go back or anything just figured id point it out in the comments section"
adv0589,Well if the results created a reliable list of who truly are the best QBs in the game you would be on to something based of traits. 
adv0589,"Yeah I never get it. ""lol its pff"" well what the fuck else would we use to rank OL players. "
adv0589,He said he is racist because he cut him and Desean.. Replacing them with black players but thats semantics to McCoy
adv0589,This guys twitter background...
adv0589,If he wanted to play football he would have been able to no problem. 
adv0589,As good as Casey is in the very least McCoy is a better player. 
adv0589,All the time if you are talking about after the first at least
adv0589,"He was praising Bradford and saying that he toughed it out on a bad offense and that is why his stats aren't there, how that was read as Tannehil doesn't have heart I have no idea. "
adv0589,How is that baiting lolol
adv0589,Didn't he average like 4 ypc outside of a single run in pouring rain.. Come on now that is not some proven back.

Just seems like if you are going to spend all of your resources building an offensive line that you might as well go all with a top tier RB"

People will tear it apart on the dumbest stuff, then even if you get them to admit it comes out pretty good in the long run they will trash it because they feel they don't need an all inclusive stat. "
adv0589,Quick someone CSI enhance that draft board 
adv0589,"Matthew had about 900 yards 8 TDs in his rookie season and did not play that many snaps and didn't break out til the second half. Just drafted Agholor at #20 and then we have Cooper/Huff/Miles Austin to sort out the last spot.

Also Ertz is probably one of the better receiving TEs but he splits time with Celek "
adv0589,He was not playing very well before that injury though. 
adv0589,85 bears are better then 04 steelers
adv0589,lmfao
adv0589,Lmao Dalton is worth more then a first and you are going to say that?
adv0589,"He missed 6 games... Once... 3 games 6 games 2 games 0 games. That's his history, none of which where particularly serious injuries.

Again the ticking time bomb knee comment has zero basis. The most time he missed to an injury was a a sprained foot lmao"
adv0589,"lol I love how the ""injured and poor OL"" shit passes on an inferior player in McFadden but when it comes to Rice the one single bad year he had behind a worse line and playing through injuries discredits his status as a top 10 type guy. 

You take away that DV charge people would laugh at you for wanting your group over him. "
adv0589,"How so, this is probably the best overall group of offensive weapons we have had since before Maclin got the ACL tear in 2013. 

We may have had Maclin last year but we had Cooper providing nothing at all at WR2 for half the season and Ertz could only get on the field for like 30% of the plays because Celek had to stay in and block with the OL injuries. 

Agholor playing great out of the box would be great but it's not like this team has nothing if he struggles to acclimate, and he is probably the most pro ready WR in the draft outside of Cooper. "
adv0589,"There is maybe 1 team in the NFL where he wouldn't be an upgrade over at least 1 tackle or RG.

If he went to some team with a dumpsterfire of an OL like you are implying it makes his chance of not getting that 2nd payday much higher. 

Again I hate to use us as an example but all 4 other guys on the line are some of the best at their position in the NFL and he could come in and play G where he will succeed day 1. Our run game would be obscene and his value would be hyper inflated. 

Not qutie the same situation but if he went to the Browns to form a Thomas-Bitonio-Mack-Evring-Collins line is another example of where he can adjust slowly and even if he struggles to acclimate will be ok. 

I don't disagree with you that he might get star struck by a team that trows a premier spot at him but that would be incredibly stupid to go to say Jacksonville, Tampa etc. "
adv0589,"&gt;I mean if you're gonna use PFF to justify your arguments, then Trent Cole didn't really have a bad year at all. +6.5 grade with +11.3 pass rushing.

And his backup/replacement that he was taking the majority of the plays from was the #3 rated overall 3-4 OLB in only 524 snaps with a 18 pass rush grade and 23 overall. And I am not trying to use PFF as some sort of gospel here, their ratings are obviously flawed and McCoy was not the #71 or whatever RB in the league last year. But he struggled horribly for a good stretch of last season, Murray would have to be extremely disappointing to not outproduce what he did last year and I think people are just seeing the name and thinking it was an obvious loss for us. 


What you are doing is what I am talking about, you are viewing the players that we had instead of the seasons they provided the team last year. Yes McCoy is a great RB and we made a lateral movement in RB skill. But he did not contribute much to the wins of last year, in order to predict a drop off in our record you have to be predicting that Murray is going to have a worse season then McCoy did last year (4.2 ypc, getting totally shut out in a lot of the games that we really needed him while racking up 150 yards in blowouts etc). 

Same as with Foles/Bradford conversation Foles. You can think Foles was a better option for 2015, but you are comparing him to the 13/10 80~ qb rating Foles of last year that was flat out bad last year and only played 7 games. 

Anyways I am not sitting here going ""OMG YOU HAVE EAGLES BELOW 10 WINS WTF YOU IDIOT"" I am just saying there is so much prediction based around us swapping out key parts that just flat out weren't that productive last season which is just an easy prediction to make, this kind of stuff is not being done with other teams. Jets have similar turnover, Bills swapped out half their damn offense and nobody is saying ""wow how will that turn out that's crazy"" like they are with the Eagles. They don't say it because the guys didn't have good seasons that are being replaced and people can't see through the names of Foles and McCoy to the fact that they were total ass last season. 


And as a side not i am not saying a rookie and Matthews will outpace Maclin (although Matthews was basically option 1b after sanchez came in). Just that Cooper was a black hole last season and in the progression of Ertz/Matthews along with moving Cooper to further reduced roles if he continues to struggle will make it not seem as important as it is on the surface. 

And your 7-9 to 12-4 range is not crazy, thats probably what about I would put the limits on. But there are people that really think this on paper is some 4 to 10 win team. "
adv0589,"Yours is clearly the blind faith in your current stable of RBs. When Murray was let go you ""obviously"" were going to just pick up a RB in the deep class and it would be fine, but now that you haven't everyone else is dumb for thinking you needed one in the first place. "
adv0589,"Probably the most QB money in the game to be broken by Luck the next year. 

Cap is up like 30m~+ since these contracts people are using as comps by the time this gets done. 

And before you all shit on his play he has garbage at WR and one of the worst lines in the league. He isn't Brady but all of you saying he is a flat out game manager are just as silly as the guys that shit on Brady before 2007.  Put Wilson on the Eagles of the last 2 seasons with that line and those weapons and there would be a very different conversation about him as a QB. "
adv0589,"You are just VASTLY underestimating Foles. I am a fan of us moving on from him because we are never going to win a superbowl with a Dalton/Foles tier QB running an offensive based team, but Foles was just as good if not better then Dalton last year. We relied on him to carry our offense when McCoy was getting like 40 yards a game and the entire line was backups. He struggled no doubt in those games but he was on pace for like 4500 yards 28 TD 21 int. And that is with foles just developing a horrible back foot throw habit that can just be corrected. "
adv0589,There are plenty of other years they were top 15-20 go look yourself lol. 
adv0589,yeah was just talkin D line lol
adv0589,"Why do you think the Giants and Redskins still get prime time games in their dumpster fire seasons. They are top 4 markets along with NE and Dallas. There is no way NBC lets a NE vs a quality team slip away.

Remember like week 13-14 in '13 the Redskins and Giants were a total joke and they put the equivalent of Jags Tennessee out there because they knew it would rake in the ratings anyways and it did  "
adv0589,"Lmfao, at least Bradford was good when he was healthy. The hilarious part is you guys have somehow landed on this ""he was just hurt"" thing when it comes to mcfadden when in reality he was healthy all last season and absolutely dreadful.

Not to mention his Trent Richardson tier vision the last few years doesn't really work with your ""lol any RB could get 900 yards before contact here"" line. "
adv0589,Something else is taken?
adv0589,That is obscene for a 3-4 end 
adv0589,"That would never happen on the Rams, Foles was good a just not turning it over and taking risks behind a top group of weapons a 2500 yard run game and the best OL in the league.

I believe he will be a quality starting QB in this league but there was nothing about that stretch that had you were like ""wow foles was great there"" that was an incredibly stacked offense with a coach getting guys absurdly open"
adv0589,"Again ""injury prone guys at key positions"". Our starting QB missed more then half the season last year, our outgoing RB averaged 4.2 YPC and we signed probably the best backup in the league to back him up, and our biggest weakness on the team got completely reworked. 

Again I will ask how you came to the conclusion that bringing in a QB with injury problems when our QB was injured last year and bringing in a RB who has missed an average of 2.5 games a year with the best backup in the league behind him instead of a 4.2 ypc back the season before is going to make it so we fall from a disappointing 10 wins to half that.

You can argue if it would have been better to not make the moves, you can argue that the team could have a disappointing season, but none of that is relevant whatsoever to an on paper division discussion. If the Lions had a disappointing season nobody is going to be shocked if the bottom 3 of your division are picking in the top 10 next year but of course you view them all in the best possible light. "
adv0589,"I love how you just glossed over swapping out the centerpiece of your offense from last year for a group of massive question marks. 

Face it we both upgraded players that under preformed form last year and ditched top tier players in Maclin and Murray. Except we went WR in the first. 
"
adv0589,Missing that teams with top tier backups like the Dolphins Eagles etc would be best off
adv0589,I hate to be the guy that constantly brings this up but the Texans got something absurd like  6 wins against guys in the top 5 picks.. And iirc didn't the bills lose in brutal fashion there and the browns game was when they were in freefall 
adv0589,"Gotta look at what things are responding to man, you completely missed the point...


The whole All pro/Pro bowl argument was totally flawed from the start, but you can't compare some top 10 pick on the biggest market in the NFL and in general a winning team to going to Buffalo as a UDFA and having to win a roster spot over 2 years. Obviously Tyron is going to make all pro teams if he preforms early in his carrer whatsoever, you cant deduct peters on early all pros/pro bowls in his career because he was switching positions and playing special teams. 

People are looking for that top 10 guy to be great, look no further then Joe Thomas, Peters has been right there with him for the last 5-6 years but since he was a top 3 pick and obviously right up there as the best OT since he came in the league hardly anyone has even considered it a competition. 




"
adv0589,"I THINK that trade was announced after the pick had actually been made for the Colts but hadn't been announced by Goodel, there was a huge lag by the TV crews when Perriman Jones and Dorsett got filed all really close to eachother. "
adv0589,"Part of you has to sorta feel for Mett, the guy had to hear all offseason about how the Titans were all in on him and they called him their mini Brady and it was all to try and net a massive trade for #2. "
adv0589,"Because

of

Health

"
adv0589,Think they just realize its a rebuilding process and are trying to build up good players. Keep in mind Scherff was probably the BPA at 5 but his actual value to a team at 5th overall with a young top 5 LT is nowhere near what you want at that position. In 2018 when this team is actually probably starting to compete for superbowls if things work out Morris could be an afterthought 
adv0589,It's hard to tell at his point 
adv0589,"No, in 2013 he played in I believe 5 games.

1 where Murray was hurt halfway through and he got carries as the starter 11 carries for 17 yards with a 14 yard long run against the redskins.

2 as the starter with him out where he was completely innefective (but against 2 good run Ds)

one where he had 1 carry

and 1 where he came in as a blowout vs the horrid bears defense and he did decently. 

Despite all the LOL SAMPLE SIZE posts 64 of his 105 carries in his career were in these games hahaha"
adv0589,"ok?

Do you expect outrage or something that they wrote an article about the top QB prospects for 2016 in the middle of May?

What else are they supposed to do"
adv0589,Lmfao im sure he was crazzzyy about going to you guys 
adv0589,"Obviously the Bills vs NFCE smackdowns. NFCW has been in the SB 3 straight years and was probably the better team in the '11 NFCCG but they had those 2 muffed punts and lost in OT, favorites to do it again now. "
adv0589,It's just a clean ACL tear man that isn't a big deal to come back from with time. 
adv0589,He has had permission to seek a trade for 2 straight offseasons because he became dominant right as he signed an extension. There is nothing BS about this story it's common knowledge 
adv0589,"Its sooo weak man, don't get it wrong you received the clutch Andy Dalton in a trade and they are similar level players. But hoillllyyy shit people calling an offense QB friendly when he has games like 
http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400554203

and 

http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400554303

is a total joke. He was getting murdered behind the line,McCoy couldn't get jack shit behind the line, one of his WRs was adjusting to the NFL and the other one racked up such a low PFF score over the first 8 games that he was the lowest rated WR with a positive net score over the 2nd half of the season. 

Dalton could NEVER do what Foles did vs the Redskins for example. "
adv0589,"Perhaps don't present it as some sort of strawman ""I told you so"" thing when he gets ranked in the 60s by PFF when a pass rusher is going to be #1 on the list and another one (Houston) is going to be very very high as well. "
adv0589,"lol, Dalton is a pro bowler compared to what the Bills have. "
adv0589,"It's funny that a lot of Cowboy fans seem to have come to the conclusion that McFadden is going to just instantly turn it around there but Ray Rice's single injury plagued season behind a terrible line all of a sudden means he is done. 

I bet he would be a Cowboy if Jerry hadn't already collected the who's who of character concerns this offseaso, and your team would probably be much better with him."
adv0589,"Not really, Reggie is higher on the all time greatest defender list then probably any other eagles player in history is at their specific position. "
adv0589,"Dude, just stop. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE for his team to lose this game. 

IMPOSSIBLE. 

So improbable that a team with 20-1 superbowl odds would go 0-16 before they lose it "
adv0589,"Are you actually kidding? Just to throw random shit out there large payments to circumvent the salary cap to players, institutionalized PED use for the team, blackmail/threats used against other teams for a competitive advantage.


Anyways as I said this is not a thing. The most severe possible possibility would be every player every coach being suspended/banned and the owner being forced to sell the team. Postseason bans etc are not a thing. "
adv0589,"Who knows, you never know where they are going. Talent there but the same conversation was happening last year. QB and WR combo and a decent collection of talent on D but they have flopped hard the last 2 years. "
adv0589,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_NFL_season

Honestly can get a rather quick summary of every single season on there that you are interested in, There is also the playoffs and superbowl pages.

Obviously everything isn't there but it does give a rather decent breakdown of the seasons without going too far in depth"
adv0589,You realize where 20 teams puts him at.. Like he is saying he is a Eli Manning type QB. 
adv0589,"&gt; playing the butthurt ex-girlfriend

You can't be serious, you realize he still hates on all the RBs drafted ahead of him on twitter 6 years later?

"
adv0589,"lol, I like how people have actually convinced themselves that the RB does not matter in the run game. 

Our OL is literally just as good at run blocking if not better and I pretty much can guarantee if we had swapped McCoy out for McFadden and co nobody would be on here going ""LOL DAT OL"".

They will still have a solid running game but nobody is going to be scared of that anymore. 

And if they have an injury or two for any period of time to that interior of the line their run game will be inept. "
adv0589,They seem like pretty even leveled players to me like 8-12 in most QB ratings is splitting hairs. 
adv0589,There isn't a single person in this thread listing their team when they aren't one of the top few groups. 
adv0589,Little bit of both 
adv0589,"Addressing the OL? We have if not the best a top 3 OL in the league, the future can be addressed at any time in the next 2 years its not like Peters and Mathis are about to retire they are still top 2-3 players at their position. "
adv0589,I don't even know what to think anymore... How could anyone read that and take it as a real opinion...
adv0589,"Literally GOAT at his position when he retired lol... 

Let alone him bringing 2 of the 3 championships into this 90 year mess. "
adv0589,Ravens are the only team I have any confidence in of those. 
adv0589,Ah yes the second a factual post not blindly supporting the elite RBBC that Dallas has amassed it suddenly isn't /r/nfl material 
adv0589,"So cutting/trading Black players to bring in new Black players is Racist now?

What do we think he moved on from his whitebread QB in the same fashion to make it seem like he isn't only trading away black team stars lolol.

Cooper was a shitty situation we needed him and a lot of the players on the team like Vick rallied around him to help him stay, you can't just rally around a fucking player as black people then get angry that black people got let go over him later on lmfao. "
adv0589,lol who knows what he was trying to get at 
adv0589,3-4 OLB&gt;4-3MLB&gt;3-4ILB&gt;4-3OLB
adv0589,The QB positions outside of the Barkley Tebow thing are almost set in stone. 
adv0589,lol is this guy scared of getting hurt of some shit. Such a small contract to sign. 
adv0589,"Unger played 6 games last season and they brought in Graham. The team literally had massive inner turmoil last year that led to the straight up release of a player they gave up a first for just last year and they ended up in the superbowl.. 

They swapped D coordinators just 2 years ago and improved, and the Cards play practically the same level of competition. "
adv0589,"Bradford if his health is ensured, obviously you have to go with Tannehil if it isn't"
adv0589,"How much thought did you put into this. 

How long is a source a source if some guy come out and says Bob the coffee boy for the packers front office revealed they are looking to trade X?

"
adv0589,"Don't even think its close lol... Vick was probably the best player in the NFL that year, would have walked away with the MVP easily if he played all 16. 

Before that he was just exciting as a runner and somewhat of an enigma if he was on your team as he obviously was a great football talent but was far more of a runner. He was kinda like the guy you loved that was in the league but you didn't exactly crave being on your team back then. "
adv0589,"Bradford I think wins if healthy. Kelly system gives a ton of stats.

Sean Lee and Bowman are my other 2. "
adv0589,"I wanted him at 20, but here 30 minutes later I think its safe was call this a horrible pick and obvious bust "
adv0589,Those are fits for the team that drafted them not the player. For example either one of them going to the Jets would have been an amazing fit because defenses will concentrate on other guys more and there is less pressure to dominate. Going into teams where there was desperate need is not really the spirit of this. 
adv0589,"No reason to even address it man, he either got some bad numbers or was just trying to dump on the rival fans team base. 

Bradford in his 5 seasons in STL

49 games 11000 yards  59 TD 38 int

59 game pace 13250 yards 71 TD 45 int

Which is probably low when you consider he was playing better at the end of his time before the injuries. 

Brees in his 5 in SD

59 games 12300 yards 79 TD 53 int

Both had their best season in their 4th year.

Brees  3150 yards 27TD 7 int

Bradford(7games) 1700 14 TD 4 int (3850 yard 32 TD 9 int) pace

And that's with Bradford having what Kendricks at TE and Tavon Austin in his rookie year? Brees with Gates putting up one of the best TE seasons in NFL history up until that point (~1k yards 13 TD) and LT having a 1800 all purpose yard 20 TD season in the backfield. 

Bees did not have the injury problems until the very very end of his time in STL that Bradford did with his 2 ACL tears, and Brees took a huge step into NFL super stardom in NO instantly. But there is not much about the on the field play that was vastly superior in SD for Brees over Bradford. 

The Collins comparison is absurd he had like 13 more ints then TDs at this point in his career and Orton I don't even understand there is literally no comparison other then them being QBs that swapped teams in a QB for QB exchange, different production different pedigree (at least collins was a high pick), completely different skill sets etc.. 

Wasted way too much time looking this stuff up but sorry but there is just flat out incorrect stats and absurd claims being made in that post for it being upvoted this much. "
adv0589,One would hope upon drafting a QB that they had greater mental fortitude than Leaf. 
adv0589,He can sit there for a year anyways and would easily have been the best OT
adv0589,"Doesn't really look to play out like that, I imagine if he is cleared say next Wednesday he would be one of the most sought after UDFAs in NFL history and would have his pick of all 32 teams. 

The dude is either going to be near his original stock after the investigation clears him or literally untouchable and facing murder charges.. Isn't much in between. "
adv0589,49/55 games to start his career. 
adv0589,What would Dalton's stats look like behind one of the worst lines in the league with zero weapons instead of a top 10 line and AJ green his entire career. 
adv0589,Very unique situation and there is nothing to support that he would have been far better off in the future as the line was trash for awhile there. 
adv0589,"And Peyton completely masks for it with absurdly quick decisions, Brady masks it with possibly the greatest in pocket footwork of all time. He has a chance to be one of those QBs that just gets murdured in the pocket like Big Ben and not everybody is going to be an absolute tank like him"
adv0589,He had just over 1k yards on 4.2~ YPC in a manning +ThoamasX2 Decker offense. Its hilarious when people just convince themselves that he has had even a single good season. 
adv0589,"3 days late here but as good of a player that McCoy is we really didn't need what he brought. The stats of our offense once you get the first first down are insane, the fast tempo offense implodes when you cant tire the defense out with moving the chains though."
adv0589,"The rumord deals weren't real

2 firsts Bradfrod Kendricks. That is absolute maximum you got offered. "
adv0589,Easily the DBs
adv0589,"Lol teams would average 3 players per team, almost everyone thinks they are sending like 5+ players "
adv0589,Hahahaha yall sitting on this one too i see 
adv0589,Thats a terrible idea for him. 
adv0589,"Trying to build some argument that his issues were mainly injury based is absurd. He missed easy throws, made horrible reads etc. 

The potential is there but you are flat out lying or a blind homer if you are going to try and say all of his issues are injuries. "
adv0589,I would be ecstatic if Rowe made it to 52 and we got him 
adv0589,Lol so you complain about a defensive player not winning in a year where a RB with a great story line had one of the best few seasons ever and dragged his team to the playoffs. 
adv0589,Not sure what planet you live on but Foles was getting murdered by Eagles fans. 
adv0589,Basically orchestrating the entire thing 
adv0589,"They made the new rule in 2013 with emphasizing holding dude... 

You are focusing way too hard on ppg line the damn players up, they had quite possibly the best secondary in the history of the NFL, and outside of the 49ers obscenely stacked front 7 probably the second best front 7 in the NFL. 
"
adv0589,"Its not like he was a top 5 pick, maybe at LG but this is OL rookies struggle year one all the time. You don't have a weakness on OL, Leary and Free are average to above average players it's fairly likely that the only reason he would start over them is because they want his potential for the future. "
adv0589,"I don't think it's as unreasonable as people say.. He played 49/55 games to start his career getting murdered behind that line, and although I am not going to sit here and say he won't I don't think its unreasonable to expect him to not tear his ACL again, it isn't supposed to be a reoccurring injury and he will have had 13 months to recover by the season. "
adv0589,Gotta take Romo of a few years ago and probably today. But yeah Id much rather have the Bradford risks over RG3
adv0589,"The fact that basic stats can be viewed as ""shitting"" by your fans is kinda sad "

adv0589,You are forgetting someone
adv0589,Don't think anyone was shocked when he went near 30
adv0589,"Eh we were decent with Foles doing it as well. Just had to only keep it or run it in general if there was a sea of grass ahead of him but we were getting 7-15 yard runs all the time. 

We kinda moved away from that entire type of offense though because that kind of shit didn't work against great defenses. "
adv0589,Yet still an almost perfect example of what I was talking about lol... 
adv0589,"He didn't miss a game why on earth are you guys pulling this hand injury shit out to try and act like that proves something.. 

And no top tier RBs are not expendable. The average ones are, but the top 8 or so do things that others can't. We let McCoy go because he was making 12~M wouldn't take a pay cut and honestly was flat out bad at times last season, and trust me we would be getting tons of shit for it if we didn't bring in 2 very good backs to replace him. 

None of that really changes what I said though, how much of a victim complex has your fan base drummed up to act like its absurd that the general opinion of a player went up when his main concern (health) was answered in a season and he won the OPOY. 

Let me give you an example, we get KILLED for letting Maclin walk in prediction threads, what wat was the opinion of him before last year? Injury prone guy who had never even had 1k yards before? Do we all sit here and cry out eyes out about how the general sub didn't respect him before his breakout season?

A fucking stat gets posted about Murrays yards after contact and the Dallas fans have swarmed this thread as if this statistic was some cold jab at their team. "
adv0589,"get the fuck out of here with your logic dude


But alright then still its a bit early to take it IMO "

adv0589,"Eh, pretty sure he is referring to rankings of unite for next season"
adv0589,"Perhaps read any of the reports?

Do you think the 2 equipment managers had texts from Brady and were talking about how Tom got mad etc months before relating to the balls were just made up in an elaborate framing job lmfo 

Like I don't really care about this, but you have to be a blind fucking homer to read those texts and not come out with the conclusion that Brady was behind this"
adv0589,"Probably #5 but luck could easily pass him this year and there is a litany of QBs like Big Ben Rivers  Ryan etc which could all easily have better seasons. 

Last year, where he magically had his best season with a prime Dez Bryant, the best run game in the league and top 3 pass blocking and is in a mix of probably 3 players in Brees, Romo and Big Ben where 1 of the 3 was not top 5. "
adv0589,People would have a much easier time moving past it if he wasn't doing what he has been doing for the last 4 months. 
adv0589,2 seconds or the next first? 
adv0589,"lol... No I am trying to say that outside of his ACL tears there isn't some long history of him not being able to stay on the field. 

If you view him under the assumption of the ACL being intact for the whole season it seems rather absurd to just assume another injury is going to occur and knock him out as was said. "
adv0589,"Feel like Johnson is without question the best tackle drafted 2013 on but I guess I have a homer side to me...

That being said I really don't get what you guys are using to put other people above him, he was a far rawer player then these guys and has been better then them"
adv0589,Not really the question though 
adv0589,"First, but that isn't really a true argument against him, its not like Murray just out of nowhere had a breakout season that nobody expected, he averaged over 5 yards a carry in 2/3 of his previous seasons. And one of his best attributes is his vision, its not like you plug any RB in there and they would have the same average yards before contact. "
adv0589,"Yeah but that was coming back from a mid season ACL tear. 

Your guys arguments fall through the floor the second that you realize that although he could tear his ACL again it isn't exactly likely. And outside of the ACL he has a high ankle sprain that they just shut him down for the final 6 games because the season was a total disaster and nothing else. 

Nobody is sitting here saying he is some lock to not get hurt, but those of you that think he is a lock to get hurt are just seeing what they want to see. "
adv0589,Just because he was drafted for 2 hours and was making jokes about the shoplifting incident possibly. It probably wasn't the smartest but people acting like it was a big deal have to be kidding me. 
adv0589,"Probably call him after the deal. Too many moving parts unless this was talked about weeks before.

"
adv0589,LOL did you really just try and build the argument that the Colts are the best team outside of the QB position in the NFL
adv0589,"You guys are struggling so hard lmao.

He specifically called him THE TOP CB in the draft class, I said he was never actually the #1 cb in the class because of his height. This guy then posted a similarly skilled short CB that dropped to the #4 CB saying ""he would like a word with me"".

So yes pretty much a perfect example of the best skilled CB in a draft class not actually being the #1 overall CB because of his height. "
adv0589,"He is adding these rookie contracts that won't be on the final 53/salary cap, and adding in McCoy's dead money. While at the same time not using actual cap hits from this year but average contract value. "
adv0589,"Have to compare it to last year where we went 10-6 though man. Maclin is the only guy who really gave us anything last year.

QB position had 27 turnovers last year. Say whatever you want about Bradford but that is unlikely to happen with him. Say he gets hurt as is the ""go to"" answer for most people, then Mark Sanchez the QB for over half the season last year will start. 

RB position, Yes we swapped out talented RBs, but this has to be one of the easiest to transition positions in the league. McCoy also gave a very weak 4.2 YPC off the back of a horrible first half last year, it seems a little unreasonable that behind one of the best few OLs in the league Murray is going to have a career low in YPC and we have Mathews to back him up.

WR. Yes we obviously took a step back by losing Maclin to KC's money. However Cooper was flat out abysmal last year, the ability to bring out Ertz Matthews and Agholor is very likely to be a similar talented group to having a black hole at one of the WR positions. Basically all I am saying is we took a step back but we are not lacking weapons. 

Our defense as a group took a big step forward as well. They were 10th-11th in defensive efficiency last season and that was with a secondary that allowed the most 20+ yard plays of any team since 2005 which was completely reworked and the likes of Casey Matthews and Emmanuel Acho being replaced by Alonso. 

Who knows how it will actually play out but come on every position that was replaced under preformed last season. It can be argued if we would have been better perhaps not touching the offense and going with Foles Maclin and McCoy going forward but just saying Maclin is the only outgoing guy who didn't have a horribly disappointing season for us last year when we went 10-6.   


If we fall off next season it is going to be about much much more  then the guys that left and came in. If we get the same production from the other 40+ players on the roster the incoming guys would have to flop incredibly hard for it to blow up, everyone is gone for a pretty damn good reason other then Mac. I get that you guys read this kind of stuff and say ""wow what a homer"" but it cannot be stressed enough how bad McCoy was for a good portion of last season (I believe PFF had him rated as the 2nd worst RB out of 73 qualified last season) and how bad the QB position was for us for most of last year as well. "
adv0589,Or you know just added nothing to the discussion for some point that doesn't even make sense. 
adv0589,"Rivers is not even in the ballpark of the HOF. 

To use the same example i was using elsewhere McNabb was rated as a higher QB vs his peers the Romo was multiple times, made a superbowl and 5 NFCCGs, finished #2 in the MVP voting etc. There is not even a conversation about him, if you make a is McNabb a HOF thread right now almost nobody is going to make the argument. The only way that Romo could really throw himself into the ""likely"" category is to have like a RS MVP, SB MVP season next year, or win multiple rings in the next few years. "
adv0589,"lol what?

His best season was 5 years ago and as recently as 2012 he was still probably the best running QB in the league. "

adv0589,"Literally no chance, and it would be embarrassing if he did. He is a top 3 back going into the year fully healthy. How on earth is that a comeback. "
adv0589,"...Were done here. The last thing the NFL wants is any negative press right now, of which this generates both more backlash at Goodell and bad press for cheating in the game.

By your logic they are just jumping at the chance for another DV case to pop up so they can get in the evening news.

As if the fucking NFL is so desperate for publicity that they are looking to bring in new viewers with a cheating scandal on the games most popular player lmfao"
adv0589,"As dumb as I think this is, I sure as shit hope it is so my Knicks can get the #1 tonight. "
adv0589,"He would have had those numbers with the weapons Tannheil has last year in 2012, and in 2013 he was having a better season then what he just had and had an acl tear halfway through. 

Again how could you say that someone who was probably playing at a higher level the last time we saw him on the field somehow has to prove himself over the other person. "
adv0589,"One of the best few at the position.. Physical freak who was drafted at #2 and basically lived up to expectations, always felt he could have been better then he was though. 

Easily best comp physically is Clowney, similar deal he should be one of the best few players at the position but you feel if they should be one of the best few defenders in the league. "
adv0589,Extend the endzone out to the 20 and we would score like a machine. 
adv0589,"Still that is quite literally their best performance. Their next 2 best seasons after that are collapsing from 6-2 and going 10-6 and losing the division because you cant hold a 21 point lead with 8m left in the 4th quarter.  

"
adv0589,"I guess they just ring of honor it, but still 88 is a tad bit differen't that was like 10 years and Irvin loves that shit "
adv0589,k
adv0589,Good lord speed was probably not the right term but quite possibly his biggest on field concern is his his ability to escape the rush/move around the pocket. 
adv0589,Id say Rowe in the late 40s
adv0589,To be fair I imagine if Jerry sold the team he wouldn't bring them with him. 
adv0589,"It's going forward, obviously he was better last year but he has taken steps forward each year and could easily be that guy this year. "
adv0589,"I get it from his end, I don't get it from the teams end. I mean if Gregory becomes a great player like he can, you could literally be faced with the awkwardness of retiring a number when current great player is currently wearing it. "
adv0589,"Yup was a DE, then a All Sec TE. Switched to OL for the draft but went undrafted, got signed by Buffalo and by the time they let him start 2 years later was one of the best OL in the league just nobody really recognized he was because it's buffalo and its not like he was some top tier player to look out for from the draft. "
adv0589,"Lol, ""tight ends block on run plays and catch on pass plays so they are more valuable then QBs who aren't involved in run plays""

That is basically what you just did. "
adv0589,"Someone that magically plays well in the playoffs and was thrown off the field by a coach for not caring! 

How could they say this!!"
adv0589,"Just obvious facts. 

Like as if Murray got hurt week 15 last year people would have gone ""No big deal we got dat OL, team is just as good"", its just some opinion that has somehow formed over time. 

That run game could even put up similar efficiency, last year it forced teams to play the run and stack the box when there was a team with Romo, Bryant and Witten on the field with top tier pass blocking. That is not going to happen next year. 

They probably will be just as good if not better from the defensive upgrades but just lmfao at how people have convinced themselves that if you have a top tier run blocking team its better to not invest in a RB rather then the other way around. "
adv0589,Eh Mathis and the 2012 draft were pretty good but yeah we got lucky he wanted out of Buffalo 
adv0589,"Everyone is just spitting out Dalton not realizing that save for Foles issue of throwing back foot interceptions last year which will end up being fixed in the off season Foles was better then Dalton last year as well.  

They are like the same level of player but Foles is actually clutch and plays his best when its on the line when dalton may be the biggest choker in the game. "
adv0589,"Average overall defense mediocre team.. I don't get this it's not like a qb would be some lock if he team missed the playoffs and his offense was middle of the pack

Downvote all you want, you guys created this retarded qualification of MVP just for Watt. You guys wanted him to be a defensive player to win mvp (very rare), on a team that didn't make the playoffs (very rare), and didn't even lead a very good unit. You wanted him to be 2 extremely rare things in the same year. "
adv0589,"Basically while the average LA fan would want either the Raiders or the Rams to come to their city because they viewed them as ""their team"". At this point the Cards have been in AZ for nearly as long as they were in STL and I seriously doubt there are many people in STL that don't view the Cards as a hated rival, let alone the team they want to root for in the future. 

Outside of talent concerns I am sure the town would be just as well off with an expansion team. 

Again not to say fuck STL here but you have to admit it makes far more sense. "
adv0589,"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/2549/year/2013/michael-vick

Not to even mention he had a 100 QB rating in 2010 and finished 2nd in the MVP voting missing like half the season"
adv0589,I still don't get where the opinion that the Texans are this super stacked team outside of the QB position comes from.. 
adv0589,"&gt;  8 guys that could start on 25ish other NFL teams

what.."
adv0589,Right... So we then of course just ignore that Garrets only good season came in the same time frame? And that the year prior the Cowboys imploded with a big lead in the division?
adv0589,That's just way too far. 
adv0589,"Keep in mind that Rodgers, Brady, Kaerpernick, Romo, Warner, and Schaub were on the bench for reasons beyond ""wait til he is ready"" and you can't really say whether they had success because of their time on the bench.

adv0589,Teams don't tank 
adv0589,Rg3 would have to have just an absurd season for that team to make the playoffs with their roster. 
adv0589,People that actually read this and think it has any credibility have to be kidding me. 
adv0589,"They do sorta, but yeah its clearly worth it at this point. "
adv0589,"Can't really compare a UDFA TE convert to a top 10 pick, he also was pretty underrated from the whole playing in buffalo and not being a high draft pick thing. 

Anyways to be objective here Smith has a bright future but has a ways to go to be a technically sound as Peters is. "
adv0589,you can basically get any of them by typing Kiper mock in the search and limiting to NFL
adv0589,"And they mentioned that he wanted to go there before the draft. But ""lol poor raiders media hates us"", damn article is supposed to be funny"

Its like you guys live in this fantasy world where everyone but Romo was responsible for everything that happened. It appears he has gotten over it here at age 35~, but before about 5 months ago the cowboys had a 2-9 record in huge win or go home games and he had won every single one he played well in. 

"
adv0589,"lmfao 8-13 range, implying that you think its reasonable to rank 12 QBs ahead of him. "
adv0589,How can you possibly have them ahead of the Packers and Seahawks? I mean cowboys are up there I could see them doing it but I don't see liking them over the other 2 on paper 
adv0589,"And I get that, nobody is saying your run game is going to be awful, it might even get similar production but it will come at the cost of production elsewhere.

You had that elite OL with an elite RB last year. Tony Romo didn't just out of nowhere throw 100-200 less passes then normal and have a QB rating 10 more then his previous high and nearly 20 more then the career average. Teams will go back to defending the pass first, you will have a top offense, but you won't have that offense that teams go into the game going holy shit we are about to have to stack the box against a team with Romo and Bryant. 

And good lord have you guys seen McFadden play? If you are hoping that he is going to bring good vision and intelligence to the party you are in for some extreme disappointment. "
adv0589,"I would consider the typical like ESPN/NFL.com type things. I get there are probably better things, but its kinda cringe watching people go LOL QBR and then throw out QB rating or some shit lol"
adv0589,lol McCoy isn't far behind but just come the hell on with some of those names you just listed
adv0589,"2014 Cards.

Good team to begin with but with that QB situation they couldn't even keep up with a sub 500 team. "
adv0589,I chose choice C and went the the next closest team. 
adv0589,"It's probably time to stop posting... 

Yes we probably get he just shot this out supporting his guy, yes we are making fun of the claim he made in this context. What are you even trying to prove here lmfao"
adv0589,lol that is an ultra homer opinion. Rodgers and Teddy aren't even close in value
adv0589,"He isn't.. At all, people just like to bitch"
adv0589,"Yeah gotta say this was a neat novelty, but over the long term the Radio City seems better. "
adv0589,"You quite literally added a word on my quote to make it look like I said something I didnt, how hard are you reaching right now.

Is in the OP

&gt;he was never #1 hes 5'9

was my response to it

.. Just stop
"
adv0589,Imagine these scores if Mathis Kelce and Johnson didn't all miss 4-8 games
adv0589,"Its like you guys don't even see what people are saying lol.

Yes your offense will still be good, but there is a reason they were far more efficient and the defense was able to out preform expectations last season and it was running the ball like a machine against teams stacking the box. "
adv0589,"What is the issue here lmfao.

It is a massive step to take listing ""The Giants and Eagles improve dramatically"" in the won't win section to ""The Eagles improved hugely,especially where they needed it"". 

Unless that was in fact a typo, how can you possibly look at that and say it's what he meant, and I legit have no idea why that response is getting murdered. 

As i said if that isn't a typo you are making an extreme leap in logic to believe that's what he said, and even if this is the case he didn't really say it in a way that made sense.... "
adv0589,Peters and Thomas are about the same level and a step ahead of the rest of the league
adv0589,I mean there are like 15-20 teams that have a better QB and most have more talent elsewhere on the team. Raiders are still probably a year out IMO. 
adv0589,"Seriously Carr Mack and Cooper is the argument so many people give. 

Like Manning OBJ and JPP just needed a late surge to go 6-10"
adv0589,Yeah the fuck out of nowhere Orlando City stickers are on 50% of the cars i see 
adv0589,"Few days late here but you do realize that our first rounder was one of the more high floor polished players in the draft and yours was a high ceiling player who got a huge boost in his stock at the combine. 

Anyways the point is Maclin hurts but Cooper was a black hole and Matthews got better and better as the season went on. The group is not better but Agholor swapping out for Maclin should be mitigated quite a bit by whoever emerges from the Huff Cooper Austin group taking over for cooper who was terrible last year, the progression of Matthews and the ability to have Ertz on the field more with a healthy OL. "
adv0589,I think some people just didn't hear from Patterson last year and figured he kept on going. He can turn it around but looked like he was headed to be a return specialist last year. 
adv0589,That's like directly asking if a 5 yard run is a bad play. 
adv0589,Seattle. They threw up a stinker against GB and still somehow won and had the Pats game in their hands before throwing it. Not to mention with Graham coming in they probably improved more then the other 2 elite teams. 
adv0589,"Its not reposts, it's the concept that some people actually want karma so bad that they save a submission and throw the same thing back a few days to weeks later.  "
adv0589,"It is, people get absurdly wide open far more then anywhere else. No real pre snap responsibility etc. 
"
adv0589,"Bradford played behind a worse OL and hardly missed any games before his knee got fucked up 2 seasons in a row?

Somehow you came to the conclusion that Bradford not playing through a high ankle sprain in 2011 and getting an ACL tear trying to scramble means he has less heart?

You don't see how it seemed a little absurd for you to act like Bradford automatically can't have heart because he didn't play through extremely serious injuries? "
adv0589,"How does he not count, think you guys didn't understand the OPs question. "
adv0589,"It makes no sense in the NFL but it is 1000% required in the NBA. Future stars are way too important and way too scarce/easy to predict in the NBA to not have this system. 

This isn't the NFL where stars emerge in the 4th round or some shit, a massive portion of the superstars in the league are top 5 picks.

Look in the league right now Lebron Davis and Durant are probably the top 3 players, the only reason they aren't all #1s is Durant was in a year where there was a freakish prospect who got derailed by injury. 

The damn ""underdog"" star up near the top may be Curry who was the 7th overall lol"

adv0589,If Vick isn't the QB of your team you are nuts. 
adv0589,"They still have done half a year of work at that point. The team both needs their scouting information, and needs to not have these guys go talk to other teams.

Eagles did the exact same thing today "
adv0589,"They have drummed up some sort of inferiority complex. Most people knew he was one of the best if healthy, and now they sit here 5 months later going LOL GOOD LUCK WITH THAT INJURY PRONE FUMBLER "
adv0589,Sorry but if Bradford is healthy this isn't even close. 
adv0589,Ehhhh the other guy is right. I like him and everything but that shit with Mett last season was pretty lame
adv0589,"None of this is good press, all of this kind of crap is just trying to preserve the NFLs image. 

Brady is at the center of some of the NFLs biggest story lines over the last 15 years. He is probably the most known player in NFL history worldwide, and singlehandedly took a franchise and made it into one of the premier 3 or so teams in the league. If you think the NFL is there pumped about Brady not being in the league you have a very twisted victim complex view of things. "
adv0589,"Not real sure how this started but their trend is to start off well collapse then somehow make the playoffs and make a run. 

Seriously 2007 they were 6-2 and went 10-6 and in 2011 6-2 before losing 5/6 and having to sneak in. 

Their other ""good"" year was 2008 where they got the 1 seed starting 11-1.

Shit last year they were 4-2 or something before we put one in between their eyes and sent them into a tailspin. 

That being said it is pretty clear that they are unstoppable with a 6-2 start. "

adv0589,"Roster stacked? There wasn't a single impact player on defense outside MAYBE Trent Cole, a few OL players and a WR/RB combo. What fucking roster do you consider stacked that has no defensive talent on paper and a offense with no QB.

adv0589,"Not really surprising that a team would be one of the better teams when they have spent all of their cap space on positions other then QB and would get a free top 10 guy. 

Seahawks are about as good outside of the QB position and have a QB sooo"
adv0589,Don't really see what you are trying to get at here. Its not like Moss is some fringe HOF player with these QBs he had he is already very securely in the top 5 of all time. You wonder if there wasn't some attitude issues at points and if he had say gone to the Packers with Favre and Rodgers or to the Pats with Bledsoe and Brady for his Career how differently he would be viewed.

adv0589,"Still a interior lineman or a RT at 5 better be an all pro type player. Not that hard to build up a line when you have a top 5 LT to build off of.

Of course the pick isn't bad you know you are getting a great player but still I would have gone a different direction. "
adv0589,"Yes because you have a top line and Romo and Dez your run game will still get quality production, the point is last year teams had no idea what to cover now it is very clear you just double Dez and play the pass. Last year if you did that Murray would have put up 200 on you. 
"
adv0589,I think those types of things usually specifically cover injuries or something.

"
adv0589,Where was this going lol

adv0589,"So we sit here with about 5 responses 1 isn't a situation and 3 aren't something you have any idea of whether it was true or not.

adv0589,First draft?
adv0589,It was the same shit last year. Jags and Raiders were primed to break out and you got shit on for saying otherwise. 
adv0589,Not really much more impressive. Clean pocket wide open guys a few short passes going for massive plays CBs fallling down etc.. 
adv0589,"Yeah lmao was trying to explain that in the ""who is the dalton of every position thread"" that's not a fucking thing for anything other then QB. 

He is simply the last QB where you are not actively looking for a new one with, somehow people that don't understand what it means or whatever have turned it into ""the most average qb"". At any position other then QB the threshold for what the true meaning of the Dalton line is much much higher.  "
adv0589,"Yeah lol if Celek went down to injury or some shit last season Ertz would have been a 1k yard receiver..

700 yards in 600 snaps, and it sure isn't the best system but PFF's best TE on a per snap basis after Gronkowski "
adv0589,"Ehhh as brain dead as this whole exchange is, I do kinda agree with this one. "
adv0589,"No idea where the ""blow up"" ideas come from. Eagles went 10-6 with a seriously disappointing seasons from every single player that left this team other then Maclin last year.

Like really here guys?

Bradford can't do better then 84 QB rating 27 turnovers, or god forbid he gets hurt and Mark Sanchez has to come in and replace the production of Mark Sanchez from 2014..

McCoy was like the 2nd worst rated RB in the NFL last season out of 70+ backs by PFF. He averaged 4.2 YPC behind one of the best few OLs in the NFL. Do we really think Murray and Matthews will be unable to produce 4.2 YPC behind our line this year??

I see little to no debate that can be made as to our defensive additions and subtractions being a net positive, we brought in alonso and reworked a bad secondary.

Maclin is gone and he was good, but we drafted a WR in the first day of the draft and had the worst WR in football playing across from him for most of last season. Ertz Agholor Matthews Celek Huff/Cooper/Austin, and the RBs is a pretty damn good group of skill position players.

As I have said, you can have your opinion as to whether the rest of the team overpreformed or that they will take a step back, you can say that those players had down years and are better then I am letting on.

But to argue that we will solely collapse on the swaps we made who all but 1 of had very bad seasons last year is an extreme stretch. "
adv0589,"Reddit circle jerk in full effect, 800 upvotes for a comment that has almost nothing to do with the issue but DAE GREG HARDDY RAY RICE FREE JOSH GORDON.  "
adv0589,Think most people viewed him as one of the best but often hurt. Last year was his 3rd lowest of 4 seasons in YPC and you guys act like some average RB just broke out last year. 
adv0589,"&gt;Why don't you like Schaub? Genuinely curious since he's been getting better every year as a starter (unless he's hurt). He might not be the guy that will single handedly win you the game, but in the position he's in, I don't think he needs to be.

Gold in retrospect. "
adv0589,"""Josh Huff is a #1 in this league, I don't think there is any debate about that""

But yeah we all thought he was just trying to be funny and point out that the cowboys don't play brady... Turns out he was serious "
adv0589,Come on man you callin other people out for being a homer and you put Amaro on there over Ertz 
adv0589,The idea with Moss is that if he had a dedicated career with some top top tier QB for 15 years it would probably be a different conversation. Moss looked literally unstoppable in New England and it was towards the end of his career. Rice had QBs of that level for his entire career. 
adv0589,"There is nothing ""real"" about it dude. This guy just has the biggest ego in the NFL and holds grudges for years. He still hates Moreno etc for going ahead of him in the draft and makes twitter comments about it and whatnot. This is literally him saying its racist because me and Desean got sent away,when both of them had massive contracts and didn't really fit what we do in the first place. If Nick Foles didn't tell you that hes willing to deal anywhere to try and get better and it isn't him hating big black personalities I have no idea what to say. "
adv0589,He played safety most of his time at school and played utter shit at uconn his stats arent fair 
adv0589,"Juding by your posts in this thread no offense dude but you would probably have 200+ players if you went team to team saying who would be on the list and then counted them up after.

Jags are not sending no do they deserve to send 5 players. Why you take out teams like the Packers Seahawks Cowboys and Pats there is going to be 75 spots or so for the remaining 28 teams. And teams like the Eagles Ravens Lions Denver etc that are going to make that share even smaller. Teams like the Jags and Raiders could easily have nobody. 

Players like Mccourty missed the list last year Weddle barely made the cut etc. "
adv0589,"I mean if Bradford is healthy he is more then enough to make this offense work well and we won 10 games with a much lower quality defense just last year with Sanchez lol. I think you guys are slight favorites but come on now with that, our run game could easily be the best in the NFL and we have weapons all over offense, if Bradford is healthy and follows up on some of the promise he has shown previously in his career this offense is going to be really good and if he blows out his ACL preseason week 1 its still going to be pretty good outside of Sanchez throwing it to the other team"
adv0589,"I think I would build some sort of 

Houston/Suh/Williams/Watt


Type lineup. They are big enough and good enough players to stop the run and this would be quite literally impossible to stop in the passing game. On passing downs you put Suh/Watt next to eachother and all but 1-2 teams in the league would not be able to block it. 
"
adv0589,"&gt;panthers and falcons both finishing above .500

You mean like what every other single division in the NFL had last year?

It all depends on what you want to view it as, Colts are a pretty damn good team but there isn't anything else to write home about in the division. NFCS has 4 decent teams but nothing even close to the colts. Either way on paper going into this season they are clearly the two worst divisions. "
adv0589,"But seriously, if a google search can not only find your answer but gives you the box where you don't even have to click on anything it probably should be asked here..."
adv0589,"Gotta give the Cowboys a slight edge. Both them and the Eagles have extreme upsides and rather high floors. Giants are the clear 3rd but I just don't see them winning the division unless they have a very good season and the 2 guys ahead of them have bad ones. 

I do find it funny though that the Eagles get this ""SO MUCH TURNOVER WHAT WILL HAPPEN"" tag while the cowboys who like the  Eagles lost 1 impact player that was not equally replaced and are going to rely on like 5 new players totally skate by as if everything is proven. "
adv0589,"yet look what they did in the playoffs, which is the only thing relevant here"
adv0589,"Hahaha didn't mean to say it was, and yeah sure its down there now because I put that edit in but I just found it funny "
adv0589,I think just throwing JJ Watt in there and making the d literally unstoppable is your best course of action 
adv0589,Bradford has not struggled to stay healthy outside of his 2 ACL tears. It is obviously looming but would not call it a good bet or anything that he is tearing his ACL again this season lol
adv0589,"&gt;Put some reasoning behind your comment or hold your tongue.

lmfao "
adv0589,It basically is the same as saying he is the 13th best QB 
adv0589,"The justification is like ""he was voted as one of the dirtiest players by his peers in 2009"" 

And Darnell Dockett was #2"
adv0589,"Yeah and Eli Manning, Stafford, Wilson, Flacco however you let that list shake out have done a shitload more then ""look good in non prime time games"" "
adv0589,"Painfully weak logic, STL went from 1-15 to 7-9 after drafting him, 2-14 in a year he had some struggles in and had a season ending injury, and then back to 7-8-1 with a full season of him in 2012.

In 2013 he had them at 3-4 but he lost to the Falcons before they went off the rails with injury on the road. Probably the 2nd best team in the NFL in the 49ers, and the Panthers on the road who got a first round bye. 

How can you pretend that they were the same without him. "
adv0589,How did you twist 1-2 in superbowls to be similar to the same win percentage in the playoffs. 
adv0589,"lol, I love this shit. 

Where did this victim complex come where everyone was ""hating on Murray"" and the run game seasons before. Only issue was ever him playing all 16. "
adv0589,You don't need hard evidence to suspect someone. 
adv0589,"Redddit 6 months ago, ""He isn't a top 10 pick, I wouldn't want him in the first round if he has this many character concerns""etc

Reddit of now, ""Such an obvious #1 overall pick, he was right to boycott ESPN because they were talking about his off the field issues""

I think with not changing my opinion on this guy whatsoever over the last 6 months I went from one of the most positive people on him to one of the most negative. 


Edit:

To be clear I did not dig particularly deep here but some of the first few things I found that would get eviscerated here now 

&gt;Does anyone else feel that Jameis Winston is.... a bit low on the intelligence scale? I've seen only a couple of interviews, but those combined with the crab thing and the sexual assault investigation, he really just does not seem smart.

Semi out of context where it was found but that pulled a +25 or something score, that would be downvoted, claims of racism, and probably deleted if said now. (and this when the CFB season was already over).


Again there is a bit of an overload on Winston for the search function so I don't have great example of responses that were upvoted to a FSU fans breakdown of him as a prospect trying to argue that he was a good prospect. 

First the only upvoted positive breakdown

&gt;the biggest difference this year besides losing KB.
As far as character, I know people that know him personally. They all swear he's a good kid that made a few stupid decisions. The big allegation we'll know more in the next few days. If the UF judge doesn't do anything to him then I think it's time we even consider that one. It's never been 50/50 maybe he did or didn't. If that was the case he would have been tried. From the start he's had two eyewitness say he didn't do it, and the accuser had multiple versions of her story all not match the evidence.
That said, he's still hurt himself this year and  I don't think I'd take him Top 5ish unless 
A) He's cleared by the UF judge B) He kicks butt against Oregon (and any game after that if they get to it) C)He doesn't create any new ""waves"" before the draft

A lot to read through there, but to be very clear THE POSITIVE view of him is saying he probably shouldn't go top 5. 

Again to be clear THIS IS A HIGHLY UPVOTED COMMENT, THE NEXT HIGHEST AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE. 

&gt;Watch Winston throw the ball, then watch a good NFL-caliber QB throw the ball.
He can't throw the ball like they can. That slow release combined with his poor ability to read defenses is going to get him eaten alive.

&gt;You complain about his line.... but he plays on a stacked college team in a shallow conference. He will never have a team at the next level that will be remotely as talented compared to the competition as the one he already plays on.

&gt;There are only a handful of teams with scouting departments / GMs who are stupid enough to take this kid in the first round. He's not a first round talent, because you should only take a QB in the first round if you are willing to stake your entire career on him. He just happens to be a big name in a weak QB class who has played on a great team.

Again upvoted opinion of him not even being a first rounder. 

And to be clear this is after the opinion of him had already started to turn. It's just way too hard to go back and find comments burried in some game thread or some shit where the opinion was at an all time low, its just way too much work to go back and find that kind of crap. Stuff with tons of comments like him declaring etc is out there but the low key stuff is long gone "
adv0589,"Eh 2011 both Eagles and Cowboys were trendy superbowl picks and the Giants ended up winning it, but yeah no idea where this would come from. "
adv0589,Desean did shit like not show up to meetings and stuff and basically forced the hand of him. You are flat out wrong if you think he would be trading a single player on that offense unless Dez went Diva on his coaching style 
adv0589,"I mean, almost no difference dude. He is a prime GOD IS GOOD HE PROVIDES EVERYTHING WE HAVE TODAY  post game interview type. "
adv0589,Foles isn't going to carry anything but if these OL and Gurley picks play out he will be enough to make them pretty damn good 
adv0589,"He tore his acl on the first day of camp with Kelly in there. He came in last season with no practice with the team, and spent the majority of the season with a first year system QB. Not really relevant that he was with the team from 09-12 under a completely different offense, HC, and QB. "
adv0589,"A cop out? 

Do you realize how retarded it would be for this to be allowed under the new rules?"
adv0589,"Where on earth are you getting 3 million from. He will probably go late 2ndd or in the 3rd next year, that is a 500k signing bonus, the entire length of his contract wont even get him 3m

You guys can't possibly think he is going to go in the first when he was already in the second half of the round and sits out an entire year for cash. "
adv0589,"Yeah as good as this letter sounds, its coming from someone who did that and has plenty of work ethic questions. "
adv0589,Amazing analysis!
adv0589,Yeah people just look at PFF grades and see Yanda way up there and ignore that Mathis got like the exact same score per snap. 
adv0589,"I mean that was pretty clear, but was still an absolutely absurd statement. "
adv0589,Not a single team above .500 and a the team with the #1 pick. What on earth is considered a terrible division if that isn't?
adv0589,"What dude Favre was 1 year separated from a run that included 2 super bowl appearances 1 win and 3 MVPs.

The 10~ years where he played in his mid to late 30s that most of reddit watched him for actually killed his stock. 

Favre is a top 10 all time QB better then the likes of Brees etc and tons of fans have this LOL INTERCEPTION circlejerk because he played far longer then he should have. "
adv0589,"Jesus the article was just making fun of that guys, they even say the Raiders were the team he wanted to go to before the draft in the article. "
adv0589,"Lmfao and what exactly has Garrett done? Took over a team people had as a super bowl contender and gone 8-8 3 straight years before finally having a winning season when he was given a franchise QB?

Chip took over a 4-12 team and has had a QB carousel with Vick then Foles then Sanchez and won 20 games in 2 years, Coughlin has the ""won 2 superbowls"" argument but Garrett come on man.  "
adv0589,"It's still unquestionably Brady. 

First 2 superbowls game winning drives. 

3rd won without needing one.

4th drive to take the lead with 230~ before the giants did it back

5th had what should have been a game sealing drive but Welker dropped the ball on 3rd down.

6th 2 4th quarter drives against a historic pass defense to win game. "
adv0589,"Yeah? 

You don't think his agent or people in his crew put his name out for the team with the biggest need at WR with the most cash?

Ever occur to you that often these things that you guys go LOL U REMEMBER THAT could have totally been true?

There were Foles to STL rumors a few weeks before it went down, aparently the talks died completely but were stuck back up and made a deal. 

If that never happened people would be here going LOL ""sources"" about that too "
adv0589,"I would understand you thinking that, but lets face it that 9-1 had most of your tough teams back loaded. Only games that should have been close on paper was @ denver which you won and us at home which you barely escaped. Maybe SD at home which was a 1 point game but I think you should win that either way. 

Seahawks are the best team of the last 3 years and are still young and improved over the offseason, You have a horse in the race that clouds your vision or are trying to make some bold prediction. 

Eagles were 2 plays from 9-0 for reference. Would you in retrospect had we won one of the 2 games we had a chance to win from the 1 yard line and had a similar end to our season with Sanchez say we should be above the Seahawks because of a 9-1 start?"
adv0589,"He isn't a normal UDFA, the severity of an injury that would require you to cut a first round talent making 450k at Tackle is absurd. 

He could tear back to back ACLs and someone would still pay that"
adv0589,Holy shit is your history really that bad 
adv0589,holy shit dude are you even reading what i am saying?
adv0589,"Yup we went 5-0 vs the 2 souths, 1-3 vs NFCW. 

Can confirm not fun"
adv0589,"Its funny because he has gone from like the 2nd to 4-5th best OL prospect to some consensus 1/2 top 10 pick in the hyperbole of the last week.

If he goes to a low pressure situation he could be good, he could also be terrible this year if these teams talking bout starting him at tackle with a bad player next to him get him. "
adv0589,Hard to put an actual percent.. But I feel far more confident in them then any other team in the NFL going into the year. 
adv0589,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFjOolWUEAESe8w.jpg
adv0589,"Jesus he was ""ok"", always had character concerns at qb and has had 2 devastating injuries in a 6 game period with no record of staying healthy. 

You don't just pass on a franchise QB at 2 to test that out, only reason i ever thought this trade would be available is because the titans convinced me they were retarded. "
adv0589,"Ah yes age, the most important thing in determining how good a player will be for the coming season. "
adv0589,I guess he fits the bill to a degree but throwing interceptions does not make you a gun slinger. 
adv0589,Sounds like a job for Matt Barkley!!
adv0589,"Yup yup keep it coming. You are very bad ass ignoring the posts, too cool i get it. Coming back just to make sure I know you are too cool for me and all very nice

You could just you know admit that you confused the flairs and though I was someone else! But this works as well my man "
adv0589,"""into the season""

Yo him getting drafted behind a few backs was a big deal to him 5 years later. You are NEVER going to hear the end of this crap from him "
adv0589,... really 
adv0589,"They still are a top draw. NBC wouldn't want it. 

As I said below the Redskins were well on their way to earning the #2 overall pick and the giants were just coming out of their 0-6 start in 2013 and they kept that on TV. When Eagles and Arizona matched up and were two of the hottest teams in the NFL and were open to flexing that week. 

The kind of matchups you would put in over any Pats game against a good team are not the kind of matchups Fox and CBS give up. This is all a ratings game to them."
adv0589,"Of course it's a concern with them. Brady has amazing all time level footwork and pocket control (And has shown that perhaps his only weakness if breaking through that mask on it like the Giants were able to do) and Manning gets the ball out absurdly fast to neutralize it. 

Think of him as a much slower Big Ben, hes gotten murdered through his time in the NFL and not everyone is going to be some all time NFL ironman like Ben. It's a real concern, and it's not just speed he doesn't have any moves to avoid the rush like say a Matt Ryan does. The dude is an Immobile statue in the pocket, I think he will be a good QB and has the body to take a beating but give me a break with the race shit. His main move to avoid the pass rush is going to be the ""im bigger then you so hopefully i dont fall when you hit me""

Will it make him a bust? Probably not but it is one of his biggest concerns. "
adv0589,"Michael Bennet is way better, and I think Ansah as he continues to grow would be ahead of him as well next year vs the run. "
adv0589,That is ONE SINGLE EXAMPLE 
adv0589,"Yes, no not much.

Jimmy is going to need those snaps very very badly for what he is about to walk into."
adv0589,"I think you overestimate the amount that it plays into it. There are other factors like getting good games and good story lines, but when it comes down to it the bosses of these guys picking what games they can get care about only one thing and that's how many people turned the TV on to watch it. "
adv0589,Reddit detective right here 
adv0589,"Seahawks play incredibly simple defense and tend to just let their talent shine through. So yes it really isn't that much of a stretch. By all accounts Quinn got that job for his ability to motivate and get people to buy in just as much as his defensive mind. 


How about you take a step back and realize that what many considered to be a top 2-3 D coordinator who was pulling far more of a smoke and mirrors act left the teams you are trying to sell us all on now, and the Cardinals have far more question marks then the Seahawks in addition to looking inferior on paper. "
adv0589,Because Ben and Romo were better last year and Luck's upside could easily make him the #5 next year? Rivers is probably right below that with Ryan 
adv0589,Come on now there is no way you can't think of something more serious then that man 
adv0589,Van Buren is clearly #1 dude lol... He was on the 75th anniversary team and is clearly the best RB in the teams history with honestly no comparison. 
adv0589,"No, they don't"
adv0589,"I guess this thread in general is just dumb because you are asking rivals to rate other rivals teams. 

Look we HOST  5 sub 500 teams from last year alone 

7 wins is low man, maybe we do football is unpredictable but it's clearly a prediction that just assumes the worst case scenario for a team.  You say you could see 13-3 to 8-8 next year, people are all rating you at 10-11 wins in here which is a fair intersection of those records. Eagles on the other hand are getting 6-10 to 8-8, if you follow that logic people think its reasonable to see like a 3-4 win season in the future with a 9-10 win cap. If every fan was in here listing the cowboys at 8-8 or worse you guys would be in here bitching too "
adv0589,"What position specifically did we get worse at other then WR?

McCoy gave us 4.2 YPC last year, Sanchez played more then half the season, and we brought in more talent at each position. "
adv0589,"I thought he was the best defensive player in the draft. 

But comparisons to Suh/McCoy that kind of stuff was just dumb. They were amazing prospects with like no holes, Williams definitely has some holes in his game he has to work on. "
adv0589,"They aren't a great example, people knew they had talent but when you chronically underachieve for like 4 years you get that rep "
adv0589,Not sure what that has to do with Eli.. His defense was insane in the playoffs the 2 years he won and he hasn't won a single playoff game outside of it. 
adv0589,Jesus commercial free until 9 yall need to get your ears checked
adv0589,"As I said elsewhere I am not sure what you guys are thinking with these comments but the Redskins are like the #4 market in the NFL. They have been terrible for 20+ years and still are there. 

The year they were good in 2012 it was a massive story RG3 became one of the most popular players in the NFL and they were the story of the NFL... 

If the NFL could pick teams to put in the superbowl rejuvenating the Redskins fan base would be right there with the Cowboys as most desirable things for them. "
adv0589,I never get where some of these things  come from. A seattle fan knocking a team for picking a mobilie QB?
adv0589,UNTIL 9
adv0589,"Top 5 dude? You can't think of 5 WRs clearly better then VJAx?

He was a borderline top 5 guy to begin with in his prime at best and those days are in the past now"
adv0589,"Its about even value, very very slightly tilted towards Eagles on the chart. "
adv0589,"Instead of circle jerking about how you can't know the formula or a single game in the history why doesn't someone find a better indicator of a persons play then these stats. 

I don't see people flip out about passer rating being used when discussing a player, yet that exact metric totally fails to weed out players like Orton and Fitzpatrick who rank above and with leagues better players. 

For example Foles was clearly to anyone who watched a better QB then Sanchez last year. No other metric you can find is going to lead you to that conclusion other then this which has Foles above Sanchez. 

Flacco who is a very good QB ranked 7th here on QBR and 17th at QB rating. 

How about you look past the circle jerk and the collection of odd placements on the list and find a stat which does a better job that you don't have to pay for. "
adv0589,"I would say it's going to take this seahawks run a few years to play out and people to take a step back to fully appreciate it but yes probably. 

What other group had top 2 players at 3 of the 4 positions and then 3 quality starters outside of that. 

In 20 years especially if they win another title or 2 here are going to remember this as one of the all time great defenses based around a secondary. "
adv0589,"what dude...

First off no, you seem to be missing something here. If the 90s bulls had this type of shit they would have been able to Draft Shaq, Webber, Iverson, and Duncan. The bulls probably would have won every single title through to today. Yes they can't afford to keep any of them but they would have been able to keep Duncan and Shaq along with another star of their choosing after Jordan retired and would have continued to get the #1 pick for the next 15 years (Yao Ming as a backup center, Lebron James coming in at the 3, Dwight Howard in to replace an aging Shaq, next year you get CP3 or Deron Williams with the logjam at C, Kevin Durant in the next few years etc.

There is a difference between watching Jordan and Pippen dominate the league and watching some team have their pick of Cp3/Deron Williams/AI, Jordan, Lebron James Kevin Durant, Duncan, Shaq Ming Howard. That team would literally fucking flatten the league every year. They would have all NBA players at the 3rd string, When they couldn't afford someone who gives a fuck you trade them for some assets and then draft #1 overall and get a new cheap player. 



Now obviously the NBA is far far worse of an example. I dunno why you would bring that into it because all you would need is 2 or 3 years in a row of winning and there is a very realistic chance that this team wins 9/10 championships for the next 30 years. 

But how would this make sense to you, say you implemented it this year. All it takes is one team to win 2 in a row or 2/3 and you start becoming unstoppable. 

You give your pats example but what if the Seahawks drafted first last year and then won this year? Say they added a Clowney talent to that defense (or Watkins, Robinson, Mack etc), then picked up a Williams or Cooper this year. 

Who's going to win the next year? Seahawks are already probably the favorite. Now you add 2 elite type players to that team. IF they win this next year it starts to snowball, you add a Joey Bosa or an elite OL prospect. Within 4 years this team would just be a superbowl factory until Wilson is done, and even then they would have to fail to see it coming or fail with that #1 pick on his replacement.  
"
adv0589,What?
adv0589,"... what?

Did you think there was going to be some lottery for a team to get a free first round pick or something"
adv0589,"Exactly though, nobody is saying start use QBR as the end all be all of statistics. Simply that it gives a far better idea of a QBs play then it is given around here. "
adv0589,There were zero injuries to his position. They just swapped him to ILB because of all the injuries. 
adv0589,Doubt it
adv0589,"Hes got starting position basically any place in consideration. One where the entire right side of the line is so weak that it is ""up for grabs"" going into the season does not seem like a place where he would go to try and get to that 2nd contract. Although Tice is a nice thing to have. "
adv0589,"Winston and to a lesser extent Mariota are heavy favorites right now for OROY

DROY not sure could be any of a mix of guys."
adv0589,wow 10/10
adv0589,"great chain of posts man, you bring a lot to the table.

I wonder at what point you realized that I was not the guy who his original post was directed at and pulled the rip cord into this ""lolol i don't care bro"" shit to try and cover the tracks that you did actually just swing and miss on reading what was going on"
adv0589,"Obviously pure speculation, but if they were interviewing him as a person of interest, even if only for his relation to the victim you would have to prepare for the interview. 

Them needing more time before they interview him does not play into the ""hes not a suspect whatsoever we just want to talk"" narrative we have heard.  "
adv0589,"What about Martin going to LG and him being RG, LG isn't normally a position you give to someone who is grooming for the future RT IMO"
adv0589,But having a position that can play at a high level til 35 means you have the best player at the position for 14 years not 9
adv0589,"Pretty sure it was Favre, like this is specifically after a down year but there was no question leading into the year before. "
adv0589,"lol, get over it guys Watt just stole a good section of votes from a QB with a 112 QB rating type season when his team didn't even make the playoffs. If his team was total shit around him he would have won MVP, how you guys have gotten so hyped up on Watt to the point that you actually think someone on a team that didn't make the playoffs was robbed I have literally no fucking clue. "
adv0589,"Yeah what, I remember arguments of him being a top 10 guy when you consider the talent around him going into last year lmao "
adv0589,"What other coaches roster half the team was gone before the 2013 season even started and they were a combined 12-20 the 2 seasons before he got there.

You aren't even talking about chip as a coach, you do realize that right. Your one complaint is him as a GM trying to move the team around to what he thinks can compete for a superbowl, you don't have a single critique of Chip the coach other then him only having 2 seasons which is double what Garrett has. "
adv0589,How on earth is he still here
adv0589,"You are grossly underestimating that absolute shitfest that would happen every few years if they took the lottery away. Teams already clearly tank under this system, Imagine 2003 when teams are fighting for Lebron or a Anthony/Wade/Bosh consolation prize. 2007 with Oden/Durant, or a few years ago with the Brow. 

If you knew the worst record would get you Lebron and there are solid consolation prizes you would be retarded not to try and just go for it unless you were a clear playoff team. 

It may be frustrating right now, but it would be so bad if 10 or so teams just gave up all hope at winning when a elite prospect emerged. "
adv0589,"Its a combo, like Bradford would be a nice candidate this year as he is somewhat written off, but like some of the shit is so dumb. Julio Jones was getting play early last season from a fucking injury he had had a full year to recover from."
adv0589,"Lee and Bowman are up there, i just think Bradford will get so many easy stats if healthy that the hype (in him being a QB on a winning team former #1 pick and out for 2 straight years) will be rather hard to beat. "
adv0589,It's quite obvious. Someone has to take a side on 90% of the first take segments. Its a debate show someone has to be a nutjob on like 50% of topic for it to make an actual tv show. 
adv0589,"Unless it was a typo to say ""improve"" instead of ""improved"" I don't see that. 


Edit: Why on earth is this getting killed so hard. I am sorry but it is an extreme leap to get from what was in the OPs post to the interpretation that was given here. Who read that and said yeah the Eagles did improve especially in the secondary before reading this post. "
adv0589,"Id probably go

1. Revis/Chro

2. CHJ/Talib

3. Sherman/Williams

4. Flowers/Verett and the Giants duo if prince can be healthy and DRC feels the need to actually try for a year.

Sherman and Williams is much better then is being given credit. Williams wasn't a frontline #1 CB with the Eagles but he is a pretty fucking good CB2 and Sherman is as good as it gets.  "
adv0589,Yeah but AFC is pretty bad at the top end. You have to factor in that the NFC teams have to beat eachother to even get a shot to play where the Pats are probably only going to have to play 1 other quality team. 
adv0589,"See i never get this. He was pretty damn good in 2011 ill give him that. But do you guys live in some sort of fantasy world where the Giants defense holding basically a who's who of best offenses in the nfl to hardly anything was bad?

Atlanta was the #7 offense and got 2 points (which Eli himself gave up), Green Bay was #1 and got 20, New England was #3 and only got 17 points. 
"
adv0589,"Just throwin it out there we had the #10-11 ranked defensive efficiency last year while giving up the most big plays in the passing game of any team since 2005. We completely reworked our secondary, if Rowe can preform well at CB2 we have one of the better defenses out there. "
adv0589,Why is this being brought up as a case I can't think of a single gm who want fired in January
adv0589,People were shocked Kaep accepted that deal and Dalton is a lower tier player. 
adv0589,Its funny how so many of his opinions clash with other people before the draft but then it becomes clear that Polian knew far far more then everyone else 
adv0589,You can walk that much in normal walking to your fridge and whatnot in not too long lol
adv0589,"Never get the complaints, who is ESPN touting as a better player then him that is incorrect "
adv0589,Id take any of the top 3 incoming rookies over him let alone Watkins 
adv0589,Cousins has been pretty bad overall but he has like 3 games where he looks like a top 5 guy. 
adv0589,"If you get drafted you can.
If he doesn't get drafted as the agent asked then he is a UDFA and not eligible to re-enter. "
adv0589,He was out like the whole season and they came 1 play from the superbowl 
adv0589,"I assume that is more attractive to him, but probably not the best decesion. In that case he can go to Cleveland and have little pressure in the thomas-bitionio-mack-erving-Collins line"
adv0589,Holy shit 5.84 YPA lmfao
adv0589,"He kinda does, a lot more cash to throw around now compared to a few years ago and he made jack shit these first 3-4 years. 

The thing is he contract should and will probably be at least 2m more a year. "
adv0589,"lol.

Ignoring the obvious fact that Adrian clearly still thinks he didn't do much wrong, be it from call it to it a whopping to the grand jury, his refusal to go into the second program from the NFL to his repeated desire to leave Minnesota because they didn't support him. 

Peterson was held off the field for 15 games and is fully healthy. He will be a top 3 back in almost every mind going into the season, #1 for many. There is nothing that he has had to overcome.

As if Vick got off with no jail time but was suspended for 16 games the next season he would have been in the running in 2008. 

Again sorry to break it to you, you found some weird pocket of people here go look at other CPOY threads nobody thinks this is a thing. 

Also wtf? Spanked his kids too hard? He hit a fucking 5 year old with a switch over and over again as a NFL athlete to the point that his balls got cut up on the other side for some non issue and had other cases brought against him before.  "
adv0589,To be fair Romo would have missed the entire season if his week 16 back injury 2 years ago happened early in the year. Sometimes injuries work out that way. Although yes he clearly is less of an injury concern. 
adv0589,no
adv0589,"Or that it is possible to admit that your o line is good without somehow drumming up some absurd we plug anyone in opinion. 

Your line is a top few run blocking line, Murray is also a top 5ish back if he stays healthy. "
adv0589,"Insane? 

Screw the math I had here, you think if he has a camp/preseason and 4 extra games he couldnt have gotten 440 yards.

He had over 90 yards in every game after the first 3. If he has one 150~ yard game you are basically projecting that he has the worst games of his season in the other 3 games, and calling it impossible for your scenario to not be true. "
adv0589,It's hard to even get whats going on.. Like he just listed out a huge defense of Dalton then refereed to Dalton as some sort of laughable player in a post 2 minutes later... 
adv0589,Cook easily would have been a first this year 
adv0589,This is almost exactly the same as asking why throwing yards are called pass yards.. 
adv0589,"... In the NFC East lol

Texans got 6 wins against against teams in the top 5 picks. And both of the division leaders in the NFCE swept your division and you are going to word it like our division padded wins. "
adv0589,"Not meant to be directed at you specifically, just a lot of people up in arms in here"
adv0589,"They are up there but the Cowboys and Eagles have more and the Browns are right there.

Keep in mind having 3 top players might seem unbeatable but the eagles have 4 and the cowboys have 3 with 2 plus players at the other positions. "
adv0589,"Good lord, i said it is probably the best turnaround in the fucking post man.

Just there are examples of teams that turned around without bringing in quite possibly the most proven talent on offense in NFL history which are more impressive IMO. 
"
adv0589,"Nobody likes to see a team leave, but to be fair here the Rams were LAs team"
adv0589,I feel like even if everything you said happened they are just a playoff threat 
adv0589,"All a team would have to do is win a few superbowls in a row and they could easily turn into a unstoppable force for decades. 

Like how does this play out for you when the Pats won 3/4 super bowls and then get to add Julius Peppers, Larry Fitz, and then the likes of Ware/Rolle etc. 

So they probably win again the next year and pick up Mario Williams or Reggie Bush.. Perhaps a all pro OT like Furgeson.

At this point they are practically an all pro team, extremely heavy favorties to go into the next year and pick up Calvin Johnson or Joe Thomas. 

Unless a team totally fails at scouting all a superbowl team would have to do is have a young star QB and win 2 superbowls in a row and they are instantly the favorites for the next 10+years."
adv0589,"Do you know what a comeback is?
"
adv0589,"Yes adrian they paid you 10+M to play 1 game last year and you have by far the biggest RB contract of all time. Vikings better pony up for him, he sure deserves more. "
adv0589,"Before last season... lmfao


Sure they are fantasy rankings but probably the easiest thing to look up for this. Yahoo had Murray at 8 last season McFadden at 52nd. 

You are flat out making stuff up with that, if you can find a single example of someone arguing McFadden above Murray before last season I would be absolutely floored. "
adv0589,Some resutrant sent him crab legs and he sent a picture out of it and some people freaked out 
adv0589,"And? Not like hes going to go in the first maybe even the 2nd... If he hits the 3rd he basically getting a tad bit more cash then he would get anyways and losing a year on his FA clock..

There was a Ravens fan suggesting this before. So I looked into it. If he is picked where say Josh Huff was in the 3rd last year he makes 700k a yr. 2.1M by 2019. If he goes underafted he makes 1.9M by 2019 and then is a free agent ready to cash in. 

Not to mention he could get a free choice at where he goes instead of playing the draft and would get an extra year of experience, and not look honestly like someone who doesnt care about football that much. (which aleady was a concern.) "
adv0589,Rather have Bradford then RG3
adv0589,Exactly I did the math earlier because this sounded like an absurd option. If he goes in the mid 3rd he will make about 2.1M by the time the rookie minimum pays him 1.9 and then he is a free agent able to totally cash in and has an extra year of experience. 
adv0589,"The fuck did his draft position have to do with anything? 

Rodgers had massive hype by the time he was taking over for Favre. "
adv0589,"Dude you had 2 4-12 teams in 2013. 

Don't give what if and possibles, what division other then the AFCS is this even a real conversation with. On paper there are divisions that have 2 teams better then anyone in your division with an argument for a 3rd. "
adv0589,"The player who's go thrown off the field by a coach for not giving a shit isn't a football lover shocking.

Dunno why he said it but who doubts this "
adv0589,Huh? He has had plenty of good defenses over the years... 
adv0589,"Favre is an all time great but Manning has always been a legit competitor for GOAT and needed more playoff success. 

Compare Favre to say Brees who both will probably end up as top 10 all timers but nobody is really going to try and say they are the best and bring up rings. "
adv0589,"I mean Martin was there for like 2 maybe 3 years, Dillion IIRC less?

For a team thats been around since 1970 that seems odd that 2/3 players were not there for most of their career and the 3rd was basically a gadget type guy. 
"
adv0589,"I love this shit. He was always considered a top RB but one who missed a few games every year. You guys were all about him last year and are convinced one of the worst RBs in the NFL the last few seasons is just going to have a career redemption with you. 

For reference he was the #8 rated fantasy back in 2014 by Yahoo taking into account the injuries and that is because they went full retard with the Monte Ball and Lacy hype. "
adv0589,"&gt;One would assume the first pick would be a lock with a 25% of winning…nope.

Lets get this straight real quick. You think a article that uses logic like that is credible "
adv0589,"You could move up like 5+ spots in the first or 10-15 in the 2nd with that pick next year if you think its expendable. Maybe even combine the 3rds for a 2nd. Maybe you guys love 2 guys in this 4th round but you just got molested in value. 

Having 2 3rd round picks doesn't mean its good business to just start making absurd negative value trades. "
adv0589,"Ill give the standard warning that if you are 27 and under Favre's stretch as the ""all time great"" was before you were watching football. 

Many of the people who poke fun at favre didn't even watch the damn guy until he was 33 "
adv0589,"Who says he didn't use his hand?

"
adv0589,"Still if you are going to say the Panthers have 1 all world player 1 pro bowl level guy and a first round rookie the Chiefs can fire back with Houston (all world) Hali (pro bowl) Johnson (3 staight pro bowls before the injury last season) not to mention a first rounder last year at OLB etc. Or the Broncos with quality players at ILB Ware, Miller and Ray. 

And then there are also teams like the Eagles who have Pro bowl level talent at every position and a first round pick at depth for OLB, former pro bowler and 3rd round pick for depth at ILB etc.. 

Either way if you want to match up in overall completeness and depth or top end players there are teams right there with them. 
"
adv0589,Yes them playing their worst game in awhile was all you
adv0589,Thats a stretch 
adv0589,The answer is Rodgers for like all but a few teams 
adv0589,It's an analogy.. You act like a RB couldn't have been picked up for a few million in the offseason. or you couldnt have picked up a RB in the 3rd. Your running game will be solid but you were one of the cheaper easier to get players in the league away from having a great one. 
adv0589,"Every time this is posted everyone totally ignores that the CBA slashed practice times and unless a QB appears mentally weak and will lose confidence or is not ready to play at a NFL level there is no reason to sit them. 

Starting a QB on Sunday means they get 2-3 times the reps that they would have had on the bench and they get game experience.

There is a very good reason that teams stopped doing this almost universally. And even when they do sit them it usually is because they very clearly weren't ready and they lived on the bench for 4 weeks or so and came in. "
adv0589,"Obviously he can't be THIS good, but he was the best WR in the NFL last year man, people aren't putting him above the super elites like Dez Jones and Johnson, they are putting him over the over the hill guys like Fitz and 2nd tier guys like Cobb desean etc. 

Like I get you can't say anything for sure this early in a career but are you honestly going to tell me right here today as we make this list that you think if we could get a WR for just next year that you would take Cobb or Fitz over OBJ?
"
adv0589,just the local game that's on.
adv0589,"he uh ""stepped back his work ethic"" after that contract IMO.

But yes behind that line if you could motivate him I think he is their best option. Like what the Cowboys think they have in McFadden but real. "
adv0589,Not sure if someone with swirling motor and work ethic concerns gets that pass. He could totally pay off and I;m not happy he went to you but come on now every team passed on him twice guys gotta stop brushing it off as him smoking once. 
adv0589,If we didn't draft that 6'9 guy we would have broken this graph with 3 CBs 1 ILB 1 WR lol
adv0589,He is solid at 3-4 ILB in some systems weakside 4-3 is easily his fit though 
adv0589,"lol, reddit thought Gabbert was better too and was raving about Newton being a horrible pick. "
adv0589,Well they did try and trade him to be fair. 
adv0589,Would not be surprised if Murray makes it in. And I think Lynch has a very very good shot. 
adv0589,"I have Gronk on offense. 

Rodgers obviously the most valuable and playing at a near all time peak for a QB, but if Gronk is healthy he just does things that nobody else has before. Also probably the only undisputable  #1 at their position. "
dean815,Keeping his value down since he is a capable backup
dean815,"true, he certainly fed Stacy a lot of carries in 2013."
dean815,Unger pls :|
dean815,He set a world record bro
dean815,You guys play us twice a year though?
dean815,because Bo Jackson
dean815,you son of a cunt
dean815,s'all good
dean815,Lol what is an oline
dean815,"B-.

After seeing how quickly OL went in round 1 the Peat pick doesn't seem like a reach at all. Anthony might be the safest ILB in the draft and I don't buy that he would have lasted to 44. Hit every major need position except WR. Good to have lots of CB and LB depth but would have liked to address WR at some point in the draft. Not sure how I feel about a QB in this draft but I have a feeling Brees and Payton have a better idea of where Brees will be in two years than I do. Overall, glad we didn't package any of our top 5 picks. Throw a bunch of options at the wall and a few will certainly stick. "
dean815,Oh wait what is your real team
dean815,can't imagine why
dean815,"whatever you want to call it, it isn't evidence. "
dean815,Does it matter?
dean815,"yeah, I don't see kikaha as a 4-3 olb at all, or a starter. he's probably be a situational pass rusher"
dean815,Jameis has a wife?
dean815,Aw bae
dean815,"there's maybe 3 games in there after week 11 that could be seen as ""bad"". He needs some polishing but adding Jameis Winston and Kenny Bell to the situation is probably gonna help"
dean815,"Well if we can take anything positive from the situation it's that hopefully the NFL making an example of us worked. 

Regardless, him telling his players to hurt the other team is (was?) simply not out of the ordinary. Several players and former players have said as much themselves in interviews. Gregg Williams is just that one friend who always takes it too far when you're joking around with your buddies. At least. Or maybe there was more to it. But we don't know. You can assume whatever you want but whatever it is I can't imagine it's worth suspending the head coach, GM, and several players for a full season. "
dean815,"Dawg, Greer was #2 for that"
dean815,Patriots flair. Don't think y'all are going to sign any of them.
dean815,"I don't know how many more ways I can explain how much of a sleazy fuck Gregg Williams is. He would have said anything to Goodell at that point because the Saints organization told him to fuck off. He went up there and said that Joe Vitt was the mastermind behind it because he was pissed at Vitt for speaking out against it. A quote from Vitt sums it up pretty well:

""""If our players went out and performed what came out of Gregg Williams' mouth, and it went from his lips to their ears, and then it went to the performance, we would have people in jail right now, ma'am,"" Vitt told NFL attorney Mary Jo White at the time. ""We would have people in jail right now.""""

Again, there's no evidence that the league warned them, there's no evidence of anything really, as far as I can tell. Hasn't been presented to the media, not to the players, not to the team, etc. 

Again, it's not that they did nothing wrong. Its that the extent to which the program went is very uncertain, and the punishment was very certain. "
dean815,Funy indeed
dean815,"**BREAKING:** Wells Report finds it is ""more probable than not"" that the bologna sandwich took several substances, including mayonnaise and mustard, to enhance deliciousness. "
dean815,TBH hawthorne isn't much of an anything. He's been below average since he got here. If you watch Ellerbe's tape from Baltimore as opposed to his time in Miami he is much better as a 3-4 ILB. If we want a run stuffer I think Ellerbe can surprise people this year. 
dean815,"To an extent. That said, Rodgers has been sacked 251 times in 7 years as a starter (during which he has missed 9 games). For comparison, PFM has been sacked 281 times in 13 seasons."
dean815,I would say Agholor and Parker ended up in better situations personally. 
dean815,I'm sorry but Larry Fitzgerald is not a top 5 receiver anymore. Hasn't had a 1000+ yd season in 3 years.
dean815,Hey I'm wishing em the best of luck as long as it's not against us!
dean815,Jairus Byrd for no reason in particular
dean815,I understand this
dean815,"I have my own system for it. Not necessarily a number but a process. Look for high TD-int ratio, success on 3rd downs, 4th quarter comebacks, game winning drives, completion percentage, any/a. Usually it isn't hard to see who was better over the course of a year and if it is too hard I call it a tie. No need to force the issue IMO"
dean815,They're definitely good but to an extent a crazy good pass rush is going to boost those stats for your DBs
dean815,I know...decided to make my own rules for the thread
dean815,Astute analysis
dean815,Marques Colston
dean815,Isnt that what that one guy on 4chan said it would be
dean815,"Since 1978 (switch to 16 game format) the only teams to miss the playoffs with at least 11 wins were the 2008 Pats (11-5) and the 1985 Broncos (11-5). This is highly unlikely and requires a very specific series of results to occur.

19 teams with 10 wins have missed the playoffs since then. It can be unfair but the reason division winners make the playoffs is to give the teams in that division a similar schedule and determine based on a similar strength of schedule which team is best to represent that division. That is why the wild card system was introduced, so that very good teams in a division with an even stronger team have a chance to make the playoffs."
dean815,Any details? What moves specifically?
dean815,No idea. I'd just be buying into the best case scenario provided by beatwriters if I tried to guess. I'll just sit back and drink my kool aid while they battle for a spot and I'll get back to y'all in a year 
dean815,"People make mistakes. If you're led to believe something is okay your whole life and it turns out you're wrong it is a tough process. With any luck he will consider himself lucky that he didn't take it too far before realizing that's not an okay way to treat your kids. He's still young and he can go a long way in redeeming himself if he commits to it, but he's gotta put actions behind his words. It's a bit shocking that he wasn't able to put it together when another of his children was beaten to death by his stepfather not six months prior to the incident but somehow he's gotta learn."
dean815,I don't understand why the consensus here seems to be that a top 3 receiver last year wouldn't continue to play at almost the same level next year. I get that Cruz is coming back but his knee was wrecked and I don't see him making the same impact. I also get that we've been burned before but this guy is sensational. Barring injury he's gotta be a top 5 WR.
dean815,I would love to see it but he was closer to 10-15 when he was healthy last year. He was on pace for maybe 1300 yds if he played the full season so hopefully he keeps improving. The team seems committed to the run this year
dean815,"You can't be objective when there is no object. All ""evidence"" provided in the case was highly circumstantial and therefore can only be looked at subjectively. I understand sometimes in life you must look at an incomplete picture and try to understand the whole story but it's just simply never going to be objective. 

edit: so as we can see, pretty much all my comments have been downvoted along with pretty much any Saints fan, so I guess we're just going to stare at a bunch of people simply stating what the NFL has stated on the subject. What is the point of this thread if there's no visibility of the Saints side of things? You can find out what the other side said just about anywhere on the internet. 

edit 2: thanks, /u/DeanBlandino, for posting the same link in every single comment chain on this thread! [here it is for those of you who missed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhnn9kbqQUA). Saints fans are well aware of this audio tape and if you really look at it objectively there are definitely some red flags. What most of us are trying to say is that:

-yes, Gregg Williams is an asshole

-there was obviously some sort of pay-for-performance program in place

-there still is not any verifiable evidence that Saints players were paid or given incentive specifically to injure players

-the allegations were more or less perceived as fact before the investigation, completely souring public perception before the organization got a word in

-the punishment was unprecedented and should not have extended beyond Gregg Williams

-the bountygate allegations should not be considered ""cheating"" nor should they be considered an ""asterisk"" on our 2009-2010 season

-Gregg Williams' ""confession"" cannot be taken at face value as his relationship with the organization deteriorated for obvious reasons after his suspension and subsequent firing, and he clearly made the statements in an attempt to be reinstated, which he was

y'all don't have to get so nasty about it either. remember here that none of us really know the entirety of the situation. some of you guys respond as if we are stupid. we're not. if the only argument you can make is based on that audio tape, maybe take a step back and think about how big of a mental leap that is. it's some national treasure 2 shit.

dean815,"I'm not sure I'd take a receiver in the first, especially with all the young talent pouring into the league. I would probably take Gronk, Brown, Dez, Jordy, and Julio Jones before OBJ in terms of receivers, and quite a few RBs. I play 2 QB so I like to get a QB somewhere in the first two or three rounds too. I think mid-late second or early third would be a good spot. I think Eli is gonna be a steal for a lot of people this year."
dean815,This is true. Definitely had some great returns
dean815,"Choose a team that is young, relatively local, and starting to not be terrible anymore. If you choose a team that is already successful you will be chastised. You have been warned. "
dean815,"hahahahahahahahahaha

but seriously.

**won't**

* Could use more experience at CB
* If malcom brown isn't the real deal they might have trouble up the middle
* If Tom Brady misses time they may lose some games. 
* Tom Brady is getting a bit older and could regress anyway. I won't expect it but won't rule it out
* ~~Historically unlikely to win back to back super bowls~~
* Three divisional rivals all looking arguably scarier than they ever have in Brady/Belichick era
* Tough schedule
* Colts looking less like a Belichick punching bag this year

**will**

* Bill Belicheck
* Tom Brady
* Rob Gronkowski
* Pretty scary front seven, especially if brown is the real deal
* They've been there more than any other team since 2002
* Haven't won fewer than 10 games since 2002
* They had a strong draft to help make up for their relatively week free agency
* They are the strongest franchise in the league


The Pats are a solid franchise and I don't expect that to change, even when Brady leaves. That said, they appear more vulnerable than they have since 2008. I don't agree with them being the top of the power rankings but I'll hold my breath here.





"
dean815,lol who needs CBs
dean815,I think he is. The stats are all there and the only argument against OBJ from a statistical standpoint is that there's not enough data. I think Nelson is more of a product of scheme and QB play than OBJ. Obviously I still think very highly of Jordy and Cobb ain't far behind but OBJ had a much better drop rate and only 200 yds and 1 td less in 4 less games. In PFF's WR Rating stat (what the QB's passer rating is when throwing to that receiver) Nelson and Cobb come up first (any guesses why?) but OBJ is third despite the 10 point disparity between Rodgers and Eli.

dean815,This this this. I just don't see any reason to get overly excited about them. I don't think the argument is there for them being the best team in their division so I don't see why people are so high on them. I could very easily see them being 3rd in the west this year.

He completely deserves to be paid in the top 5 in the league and his first contract was a joke. He averaged about $10 million per year against the cap his first 6 years in New Orleans, when he had at least 3 years where there was a serious case to be made for him as MVP, and he led us to our only Super Bowl victory. 

Over the life of his 11 year contract after the extension his cap hit averaged about 14.3 million per year at only 38.2% guaranteed. That is a goddamn steal. It's not quite as cheap as Brady's but not everyone has that financial security. "

On top of that Pamphillion adds in his own assertions by indicating that Williams had made nonverbal signals during the speech. As such this is not evidence. It's a statement made by someone who was there. Others who were there, including people not affiliated with the Saints organization, have stated that the speech was edited removing context and that the nonverbal signals did not happen. It's a nasty speech (as I've said to others, this goon fucking quotes Memoirs of a Geisha in it), but it's not proof of anything other than that Gregg Williams is a douchebag."

dean815,"It's just that his production per target was even astounding, which is why he was so phenomenal. Combine great efficiency with high volume and you'll get good results. He got 130 targets in 12 games. The NFL's top 10 have averaged 150-200 targets per season over the past 5 years or so. I don't think Cruz coming back is going to prevent him from getting the 11 or so targets per game he had last year. Really only onw game was off-the-charts volume and that was week 17 vs the Giants where he was targeted 21 times.Even if somehow he's only seeing 10 targets per game and his catch rate drops by 5% to 65%, he'd be on pace for 104 catches. If he had played the whole season on the pace he was on last year he would have landed at #5 on the all-time single-season receiving yards list."

We have a top 10 all time qb, one of the best left tackles to ever play, fantastic offensive line, possibly the most dominant single-season LB corps in the history of the game, and a decent D-line.

dean815,"Dolphins could be good but Lamar is the only proven back on the roster. 

Jets are a hodgepodge of random guys other teams didnt want but could be good.  "
dean815,"Regress. I really do think there's a chance this team wins about 6 games. They're no better on paper than the Giants have been the past few years and they just flat out looked bad down the stretch. It can't be overlooked that they lost their best offensive player and best defensive player of the past decade this offseason, even if Gore was less effective than usual last year. The whole situation with Harbaugh is enough to question the decision-making of the FO. 

Even if most of that turns out to be wrong, their schedule is fucking brutal. As /u/smacksaw pointed out above, they play 5 of their 8 away games in Eastern time, which is a 10am game. Traveling East for a game is one of the few statistically proven conditions that throws teams off. 

Nobody wants to admit their team may be headed for a bad year (I certainly won't for my Saints) but this season is going to be a rough one for 49ers fans. 

My prediction is 5-11. "

dean815,Some of our key players are and have been ex-Bills so that can't hurt!
dean815,"I think there's a chance the Saints, Panthers, and Falcons are all above .500 this year. We all get to play the Titans and Jags and while they may have improved the division is still pretty weak overall. 

If I had to pick two teams that would be under .500 I'd pick Tampa and Carolina. Tampa will undoubtedly have some growing pains with a rookie QB. It seems to me a lot of people have forgotten that Carolina was under .500 last year. They're the only team in the division I would confidently say has not made major improvements. They managed to find the only Tackle worse than Byron Bell, lost Greg Hardy, failed to make many impactful FA signings, and had a pretty confusing draft. Their first round pick strengthens their best positional unit but I'm not sure I understand moving up for Funchess in the second. He's very similar to KB and they could have used a smaller, speedier guy with good hands to fill the Steve Smith role. On top of all of that, I'd be surprised if the strong showing late last season is indicative of Jonathan Stewart's future play as the perennially injured RB is now 28. Rivera said he'd like to limit Stewart to 15 carries a game, but as of now they don't have a definite option and also have no line to support the run game."
dean815,I'd also argue Jordan Cameron is a higher cap hit (for now) and a less productive player
dean815,I overlooked Felton. I'm not high on Boobie or Jackson this year though.
dean815,"I'm not sure the hit itself caused a turnover - Favre just threw a bad pass because the backfield was full of Saints players. 

It was a rough hit, and I don't know much about that rule admittedly, so I can't say for certain. But if you watch the play, there's just not really much they could have done to avoid it. McCray was coming from Favre's right and made a dive towards him as soon as he saw Favre start to throw. Ayodele was coming from the front and started to close in at exactly the same time. 

I really don't know how teams are expected to avoid it other than just not going low on a QB. I think that play got more attention because of the uncertainty with the rule and because Favre appeared injured after the play. Obviously the bountygate allegations made it seem worse after the fact. 

Like I said, I don't know exactly how that rule works or how two defenders would avoid breaking it, but other than that and the aforementioned hit made by Harper I don't see how it was called that poorly to be honest. IIRC there were some other non-roughness related calls that might have gone our way in that game as well but I'm having trouble remembering. Happens to every team at one point or another."
dean815,"Cooper just seems like a lock to me. Probably the smartest and most well-rounded receiver in the class and may be the piece that puts a rebuilding team into some marginal success.

Devante Parker just straight up reminds me of AJ Green on the field and I think he's in a great situation to fill that role in an increasingly potent Dolphins offense.

Nelson Agholor is immediately put in a position to succeed. It's pretty clear now that Chip had a replacement in mind when Maclin was asking for 10m+ per year. He'll look like a genius when Agholor picks up right where Maclin left off.

Tyler Lockett should be a good addition to an already talented Seattle offense, and will bring some excitement to a return game that often lacked explosiveness.

Kansas City is about to see what it's like to have some firepower on offense beyond Jamaal Charles. With newly acquired receiver Jeremy Maclin, rising star Travis Kelce, and rookie receiver Chris Conley, Alex Smith is primed to have a career year and silence the critics. Conley provides a prototypical #1 receiver build to compliment Maclin's sharp routes and Kelce's commanding size. Conley will need some time to develop but his combine performance (4.35 40m (Tie-2nd among WR), 45"" vertical(1st), 11'7"" broad jump(1st), 33 3/4"" wingspan(1st)) shows that he has unlimited potential."

dean815,"Except that the audio doesn't actually include proof that he pointed at his chin or rubbed his fingers together. For the one person that said he did in the video release, there are several who say he did not, including people with no affiliation to the Saints organization. You shouldn't just take those things as fact as they change the context entirely."
dean815,"I don't know about the Cards. They lost a starting CB, both nose tackles and their DC. They have a studly offensive line but their starting QB and RB both have extensive injury histories and their #1 receiver is declining. I don't think they'll be a bad team but I don't think they're poised to win any playoff games.

I think a few of these teams are an elite QB away from being real contenders. Bills, Eagles, and Texans would all have a real shot if they had a top-10 QB. Even the Browns could be very good with a good QB. They have an elite offensive line, decent young RBs, a great secondary, and decent pass rush. With a QB, improved run stopping, and a big play WR (josh gordon??) they would be right in the mix to win the division.

The Vikings, Bengals, and Lions all appear to have the talent and a good enough QB to make a run but are relatively young teams and do need to patch up a few areas.

The Falcons with an improved defense and rushing attack would be a scary team, and the Panthers with an improved offensive line could also make a run. The Chargers would come in this category as well as they have an elite QB and a lot of talent but need to patch up some areas in the trenches. I'd put the Cardinals in this category as well.

I don't think the Titans or Jaguars are close really.

I think the team with the best shot would be the Eagles if Bradford plays to his potential and stays healthy."

I could understand Rodgers over Brees because of efficiency etc. in 2011 and I would have even been able to understand Favre over Brees in 2009 but Brees had Manning beat in every category except yards in 2009 while playing on a less complete roster.

dean815,I figured there was less for those reasons but Ive tried searching internet archives and such and I just can't find anything but praise in that offseason. Good point about him being on a prolific offense. Thanks for actually giving me a well thought out response and answering the question. Half of the folks in here took this as an invitation to explain why they think OBJ is overrated.

dean815,One pregame speech by a coach who is clearly overzealous does not equate to the allegations made by the NFL or the punishment handed out for those allegations. He fucking quotes Memoirs of a Geisha in that speech. Regardless just watch former players reactions to it. For the most part they say it's the same shit that coaches say in every locker room except a little bit more over the top. None of them that I've seen seem to think it is damning enough to deserve punishment beyond punishing Gregg Williams

dean815,It's funny - a lot of people think Pats deserve #1 in the power rankings as sb champs until they show otherwise. OBJ was the best wr in the NFL for the last 9 weeks of the season and people refuse to say he is top 5. 
dean815,"maybe it's not the organization directly, but the Indy media and fanbase has been an absolute shitshow on the matter. [Irsay's first tweet addressing the game](https://twitter.com/JimIrsay/status/559507452996362240) was obviously a firestarter of sorts. He went on to congratulate the Pats and tell how he respects their rivalry, but if I'm the owner of a team I would take the high road and just say congrats. If they truly thought the Pats had gained an advantage the NFL proceedings would have relayed that. "
dean815,very low possibility that this happens. It costs them more to cut him than to keep him. if they go into camp with the notion that they have to cut a first round draft pick from two years ago so they can get a better look at two guys who haven't done shit in the NFL then this team is truly fucked.
dean815,I have really high hopes for Anthony as a versatile ILB. should help immediately in the run game as he's the most athletic LB we've had in a while.
dean815,Would have Roethlisberger and Rivers on there before Newton for sure
dean815,"One instance of a Defensive Coordinator telling players ""first one's on me"" in regards to sacking the opposing team's quarterback is hardly a smoking gun.

Even a die hard NFL fan would not have thought twice other than saying ""Damn. This guy is an asshole and should be fired"""

dean815,If it weren't for Andrew Luck I would just look at that Colts team and it would scream total bust to me.

It shocks me how little they did to improve the D this offseason.

dean815,"I've adressed these same remarks elsewhere, but in summary:

Your first two sources are simply the allegations that I'm looking for evidence to substantiate. I'm not arguing that the NFL didn't punish the Saints.

The second one is literally just believing what one person says about one meeting. The audio is there. It's not pleasant. Gregg Williams is a cunt. But he has to add visual context that is not provided to substantiate the point, and those claims have been refuted by several others who were in that meeting including people not under Saints employ. I don't see why I'm expected to just take what this guy says as a fact. 

I'll say it again. I think there was a pay-for-performance program and that extended to big hits. It wasn't pretty. But it was handled inappropriately and cast the whole organization in a negative light. It certainly wasn't deserving of the yearlong suspension of a head coach among other punishments.

dean815,"In what way? His first year was not good but 2013 and 2014 he improved both years. He's had unreliable receivers and has been the 6th, 1st, and 3rd most sacked quarterback in the league respectively over the last three years. His 2013 was the 10th most sacked of all time. It's tough to be a good QB when the pocket breaks down all the time but he managed to post a really good stat line this year. Dalton and Newton have both shown regression the past year while Tannehill had his best season. 

Miami, Cincy, and Carolina actually ranked 14th, 15th, and 16th respectively in total offense this year despite Miami's coaching staff refusing to give the ball to Lamar Miller more than 15 times per game. In points per game, the Dolphins were ranked 11th with Cincy at 15 and Carolina at 19. 

His trajectory makes sense as he was moved to WR when he first went to Texas A&amp;M and had to redevelop as a QB. "
dean815,The only reason I hate him is because he has been making ridiculous statements about personnel management. And then they come true. Every fuckin' time.

dean815,"Jimmy Graham was actually an above-average run blocking tight end last year. There really aren't many guys left that are specifically good blocking TE's.

I looked at PFF's pass blocking efficiency stat after thinking about this for a bit and I saw that 4 players who played over 25% of their team's snaps never allowed pressure from their assignments:

Greg Olsen, CAR (601 passing snaps, 67 pass block snaps)

Jim Dray, CLE (237 Pass snaps, 65 pass block snaps)

Scott Chandler, BUF (511 pass plays, 38 pass block snaps)

Josh Hill, NO (112 pass plays, 36 pass block snaps)

Of guys who played at least 100 pass block snaps, Jermaine Gresham had the highest efficiency, allowing only one total pressure (1 QB hurry) in 100 snaps (99.3% PBE).


Interesting that two of those guys were backups to TEs who have changed teams this offseason. "

dean815,OLB Davis Tull. Had the highest SPARQ score of any edge rusher at the combine. Don't know much about him but he was absolutely dominant in college but in the FCS which is why he was 5th round. We have some guys who have been around a while despite lacking ideal measurables so maybe they can contribute by turning this freak show into an NFL football player. 
dean815,He was better than people think at run blocking last year. He just doesn't get the volume because he's more valuable dragging the coverage linebacker or safety out of the box. 
dean815,"Yeah it was just the most annoying memory of the end of his NO stint. It was like he would get hit and injured on a return and fumble, then eventually they'd put him back in at returner and boom immediate fumble. Or at least that's how my douchebag brain remembers it"

dean815,I totally get what you mean and don't want to make this a pissing contest but OBJ outperformed Calvin and Green already last year. They both played in 13 games and each had one that wouldn't really count because they were injured and couldn't do much. Over the 12 games they each played OBJ outperformed both of them. I have just as much faith in both of those guys to be right on top as OBJ but I just don't see why it's so ridiculous
dean815,We don't necessarily have to decide who's better. Everyone's entitled to an opinion but when it comes to Brady/Manning or whatever I think it's fine to recognize a group of the best and leave it at that.

One of the missed calls was on a high-low hit, which I understand had been established the year before, but it's a tough spot because it was just two guys getting after the QB with bad timing. I've watched the tape a ton and those guys were just trying to get after him.

Not trying to be one-track minded here and I am strongly pro-marijuana but suddenly stopping smoking would definitely have an effect on appetite. Anyway he fell a bit further than most thought he should've but teams were definitely still interested. There were other teams waiting to grab him in the third."

dean815,"Worth noting that [the NFL did set a precedent](http://deadspin.com/5953194/the-nfl-was-completely-fine-with-smash-for-cash-bounty-programs-16-years-ago) for this in 1996.

""The 'Smash-for-Cash' program is within the rules as long as players use their own monies, the amounts are not exorbitant, and the payments are not for illegal hits.""

They likened it to ""a quarterback buying gifts for his offensive linemen"".


Just so you know - I think this statement was intended to make that point exactly - that because it wasn't team money and the amounts were relatively low, it wasn't considered a violation of salary cap rules."
dean815,"I know. Not saying Brandin Cooks has the same catch radius at all but in terms of size, speed, and agility, he's right there with him. A lot of people seem to think Cooks is like Darren Sproles size"
dean815,No shit he's fine with it. He's making more this year than I'll make in 10 years at my current salary. If he had any college loans he can pay them off this year. He's incredibly fortunate to have made it to the highest level of his sport and would be an idiot to be upset about his draft position.
dean815,I feel like that's what our interior offensive line was thinking about everybody last year.

dean815,Lol do it don't worry he won't fumble trust me
dean815,must be the #1 look isn't getting open very often. He's been their most targeted WR since 2007 and while he has had less yards than floyd the past two years (each year by less than 100 yards) he has 37 more catches and 1 more TD over that timespan.
dean815,[Larry Fitzgerald is your #1 WR right now](http://www.azcardinals.com/team/depth-chart.html)

dean815,"Gotta cover all your bases. I'm not pretending to know for sure that the Saints pay-for-performance program wasn't as bad as Goodell painted it, but I haven't been given any substantial evidence to corroborate the story. If I'm wrong and they did have a program, the punishment is still too severe. Suspend Gregg Williams, absolutely, maybe suspend a couple players for a few games, and hit the team with a fine. Obviously nobody in New Orleans is going to take it lying down until there's proof but it would certainly have helped if the punishment was in line with the allegations."

dean815,One of my fav plays of the season. Can't believe some people think there is any contest for starting RB there next year. 
dean815,50-60k is enough money to hold you over for a year while you figure out what to do next at least. Udfa could get cut and get hardly any money from it. 
dean815,The audio recordings do not contain any admission or evidence of guilt in terms of money exchanged. The admission of guilt by Gregg Williams was a plea bargain to get reinstated and that is plainly obvious. It's comical that people take that admission as evidence. 
dean815,"It definitely does mean *something*

It may seem like pennies compared to a big contract but the winners get 55k and the losers get 26k. Also to be able to be recognized by fans is pretty great. Even if statistically a certain player (cough Graham cough) may not have been a good selection, it's probably an awesome feeling to know your fanbase has your back like that."
dean815,Definitely tough to justify that contract when it was a nationwide dispute as to whether the Saints should pay Graham 10mil per
dean815,gotcha. Yeah I wouldn't write the Texans off at all. still seem to be on the upswing to me if Foster stays healthy
dean815,You guys ever actually watch Graham play other than on Sportscenter? He was an above average run blocker last year. He will be fine. 
dean815,"Me too man - people are not ready for him to bust out the way he will this year. 

[Here's a post about his size that I shared in /r/Saints earlier this offseason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Saints/comments/32kalt/wanted_to_put_some_perspective_on_brandin_cooks/) - TL;DR he's not as small as people think. "
dean815,Classy move with the alphabetical order
dean815,I keep seeing this and it's just fucking stupid. I think it is incredibly likely that they are average this year
dean815,nope
dean815,I feel like actually meeting Stephen A would be cool. He seems like a good guy. Skip is just a goddamn idiot though
dean815,18
dean815,I think Manziel will turn it around. He's got a better team around him than they get credit for. Maybe not this year but he was absolutely electric in college and I think he's just got some crazy instincts and someone may have to beat it out of him but it will get done. 
dean815,Let's not lose sight of my original comment. A penalty is surely warranted but the case has spiraled out of control and a severe punishment would be unwarranted and unprecedented. It's a good idea for the league to put a better system in place to prevent tampering whether it is an organizational attempt to tip the balances or a ball boy acting on his own accord.

dean815,"toss up between Deandre and Alshon for me. Especially as a Saints fan, I think we have a guy in Cooks who is a similar player to TY and will be a more complete receiver in time. Between the other two I guess I'd have to take AJ because I think he's a better red zone threat which is what we'd really benefit the most from. If I'm a team who lacks a downfield threat, though, I'd go DeAndre. dude has wheeeeeeels and crazy ball tracking ability."
dean815,Giants and Cowboys
dean815,lol there will obviously be a competition. if he goes out and throws 5 picks in the preseason they'll be singing a different tune.
dean815,that is true but this was his one really great game. seems like it's mentioned anytime he's brought up here.

I'm not gonna sit here all day to explain it but we've all seen that question asked the same way and there's a reason why. "
dean815,Miami. We effectively traded Stills for Ellerbe and PJ Williams. We drafted a player in the first round who should take Ellerbe's roster spot and PJ Williams is going to have to compete for the nickel spot. Kenny Stills had a really good year last year no matter how you slice it. Another 2 years on the cheap from him would have been really helpful. I'm still scratching my head on this one honestly. Especially with rumors of Kenny having character issues - Joe Morgan has clearly had worse. My thinking is that Kenny wanted to leave NO and team up with a QB more aligned with his career trajectory.
dean815,"Amazing

dean815,Not who I expected from a Packer fan but I agree. 
dean815,"I'm suggesting that the legal services industry is more or less a racket for the wealthy to impose their will on the country at this point. That extends to this scenario. When the NFL pays a lawyer to look into something, the result will ultimately be what the NFL wants it to be."
dean815,He's also had a terrible run game though to be fair.
dean815,"So where have we landed on this? Wins are a QB stat now? Brees led the league in ANY/A, passer rating, completion pct, passing TDs, etc. it's absurd to think there's no discussion. They both had amazing seasons and the whole year was about Peyton and Brees. Brees led in most of the non-volume categories so I don't see how giving Peyton two more weeks necessarily gives him an advantage. Regardless they were both incredible and it would have been nice to have Brees get an MVP rather than Manning, who's got lots of hardware. "
dean815,"The fine and draft picks are not being appealed. 

I think Brady's appeal will see the suspension removed as it is in the best interest of the NFL to have their most prolific player on the field opening week and during a divisional matchup week two and against another high profile team (Dallas) week 4"

-Harbaugh was being shown the door, and we knew that before the offseason hit. Poor play last year was definitely partly caused by this elephant in the room

-Willis, Smith, and Gore were all declining or beginning to decline

-Smith is an upgrade over Crabtree

-They still have a good secondary despite losing Culliver

-If Arik Armstead can be a quality day-1 starter and Dockett stays healthy they still have a very good front seven

-I would expect more out of Hyde/Bush as a combo than Gore/Hyde simply because it gives them more variation

This was the most pivotal event in the history of the city and of course it was going to come up. They were 3 years removed from not having a home stadium to play in.

Peyton Manning also set records for Passing yards and Passing TDs that year and was arguably the greatest single season performance by any QB ever. That might be the best statistically. 

2011 was a big year for volume passing too with 3 of the 8 5000+ yd seasons that year (Brees, Brady, Stafford) and Brees' 5,476 yards setting a record that PFM would go on to beat by *one yard* in 2013. "

dean815,"this is a list of the top 20 single season run blocking grades over the span of 6 years, three of which he wasn't in the NFL yet for. This only proves that he's not an elite run-blocker, which I am not claiming. If we are going by PFF, you should know that he has only posted a season with negative grade (0 is average) once since 2010. That was in 2013, and working on his blocking technique was a major topic last offseason after we signed him to the big contract. This season, he was ranked 14th among all tight ends in run blocking, and that is not adjusted for volume, because players accumulate points towards each grade on every play. He doesn't put up incredible grades because he hasn't been asked to block much in our system. More often than not his skill as a receiver makes him a better threat to run routes and make blocks downfield. Would you rather have your star receiver blocking a guy at the line of scrimmage or bringing him 15 yards down the field in coverage?

dean815,"The really bad late hit and the pile drive were both called penalties is all I'm saying. Rightfully so. It certainly wasn't the first time a QB had been beat up like that either.

dean815,"It's hard for me to see the saints doing worse than 7-9 for a couple reasons:

-the homer glasses are blocking out the haters

-Brees didn't really regress last year - he just had the worst timing of his career with his inevitable 15+ interceptions

-we have one of the top 5 easiest schedules in the NFL

-defense should improve more than I can see the offense regressing"
dean815,"Fair? one or two game suspension at most, *and stop letting the fucking teams supply the balls!* "
dean815,I don't know how anyone can disagree with this. He's a scumbag.
dean815,"Wide receiver, left guard, defensive tackle. 

I have to admit as someone who wanted the Saints to wait until the 3rd to grab a receiver I never thought I'd be worried about it but now it's all on a bunch of inexperienced WRs to step up for the WR3 position, and even with that being the case, our WR1 and WR2 aren't necessarily stars heading into the season. 

We did draft Peat and I think the idea there is to have him work into the LT role and move Terron Armstead to RT by next year to shed Strief's high cap hit. one of the three may move to LG this year but something tells me they feel comfortable with either Kelemente or Lelito there. Having Unger at center should be a huge help to both guards.

DT is a weird spot because we haven't really been disastrously bad there but we need someone who can really hold it down and allow Cam Jordan to work the outside a bit more."
dean815,"You should reword your question to ""does anyone think the Titans, Redskins, Jags, Browns, Bucs or Raiders will have a shot at their division this year?""

cause otherwise people ain't gonna be surprised

My surprise team is the Chiefs offense. Jamaal Charles will be #1 this year"
dean815,Ungh leveon won me so much money in DFS that game. Forgot about burger vs burger entirely
dean815,interesting. Ivory may be one of the most underrated backs in the league. I didn't realize how little his line was helping him.

dean815,And the AFC South.

dean815,"Chargers, Bills, Eagles for personnel sharing. "
dean815,I think they'd be pretty damn close. one more guy rushing the passer or one more guy double teaming their best player would do a lot for them.
dean815,"this is what I'm looking for. It's worth noting that OBJ's major breakout game was on prime time vs. Indy and his most notable game was on primetime vs. Dallas. That said, his performance in the context of a 6-10 season would naturally seem less dominant than Moss' in context."
dean815,Might be third on the active depth chart if he used to play qb some
dean815,yeah that is true. with that in mind maybe I should recant my statement haha
dean815,"I'm the opposite of a troll...I am sitting here defending my team, not just wasting your time. There are absolutely inferences to be made to get from Gregg Williams acting like an ass on tape to making accusations with the level of specificity the NFL used. They said things like the amount of players allegedly involved, specific amounts of money that are not supported by evidence, dates of warnings they sent to the team, etc. but none of this is backed by evidence from the league. "
dean815,haha yeah this one is fantastic.
dean815,I just think so many other teams made a better case for improvement this offseason. 
dean815,Also nobody said wide receiver. Just receiver. He is certainly that. 
dean815,"Since 1990 (start of 12 team playoff format), at least 4 playoff teams have missed the playoffs the following season. I'll take a wager that this ain't the year that stops. "
dean815,Probably not
dean815,While we're on that topic what the shit is your username? Did lastpass generate that?
dean815,To be fair our guards have historically made more money than most LTs with Breesy around

dean815,I think you're forgetting about the [New York Jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZxNeFLuY98)
dean815,mysterious
dean815,Nah I like those guys
dean815,There is no evidence or even allegations that he had been doing it any longer than this season.
dean815,"Nobody is denying that Gregg Williams is a cunt. Just because he told them to go hurt people doesn't mean they did. The Saints caused [less injuries than the league average](https://www.aei.org/publication/the-saints-aint-sinners/) over that time period. I've been watching the Saints for a long time, and they weren't playing any ""dirtier"" than anyone else or than they had previously - go back and watch if you want. The fact that their pass rush was actually existent during the playoffs when they happened to be playing two of the oldest quarterbacks in the league doesn't change that."
dean815,Brees and Wilson would be a pretty good QB room
dean815,"I don't see the Patriots or Broncos ""fading from relevance"". They both have very good FO's and I am not drinking the Kool-aid on this notion that Belichick is going to up and quit when Brady retires. As long as he's there, the Pats are a contender IMO. The Broncos will suffer when they lose PFM but they deserve credit for the young core of players they've built around. Von Miller, Chris Harris Jr., Demariyus Thomas, CJ Anderson, and Brandon Marshall are all going to see continued success. Gary Kubiak is also a very good offensive mind that is going to take that run game to a whole new level this year. 

I think of the bottom-dwellers of the past few years (Raiders, Skins, Titans, Jags, Jets, Bucs, Browns) the only teams you couldn't sell me on getting out of the basement this year are the Titans and Skins. Not that they all will, but the other teams have a lot of promise and just need a few guys to step up to make some waves."

dean815,"He's facing a real probability of suspension after he is reinstated because he was convicted on domestic violence charges shortly before his last suspension which was purely drug-based. He's probably out at least 6 games and the Cards have not been shy about saying he is a liability. 

That said those are good points you made and I think the Cardinals is a team I just need to learn more about. There's a lot of contributors on the team that I just don't know anything about. "

dean815,"Favre was hit 7 times in that game. 2 penalties were called. I've watched the game several times. It was rough and the refs called it pretty loose. That said, there was really only one hit outside those two that could have been called a penalty, and that was a hit Roman Harper made without wrapping him up. The only two totally egregious hits were called penalties but for some reason people around here seem to think it was the most brutal game ever played. It's a day at the office for Jay Cutler."
dean815,Rams also have other options at RB and could give him some time coming off injury so I'm not totally sold on him being high volume this year. 
dean815,0 pro bowl appearances is what gets me

dean815,"I would say he is a top 5 3-4 DE. Watt, Richardson, Campbell Wilkerson, Cox off the top of my head."
dean815,bullshit don't believe everything Jason Cole tells you
dean815,I would put Rodgers at #2 and PT at # 3 tbh. PT has the highest YPC of any Saints RB with 300+ carries and only fumbled 7 times his whole time here. Wasn't as electric as some of those guys at their best but he was so consistent. Gonna fucking miss that dude. 
dean815,That's a perfectly good question that I have no answer to. My best guess is because the Colts made a big stink about it and the NFL's options were limited to putting the blame on NE or admitting that their system for equipment regulation is garbage.
dean815,"Can't imagine they'd waste a 5th rd draft pick on a guy they don't definitely see making the roster. Looks like y'all usually carry 5 or 6 guys...so Wallace, Johnson, Wright, Patterson, Diggs, and Thielen if they carry 6, right?"
dean815,didn't mean to imply that. my bad
dean815,"I agree man - never said I didn't. I hope the Eagles win the East this year, and they very well might. Regardless of talent, sometimes it just doesn't work out. Nobody thought the ""dream team"" would go 12-20 over two years.

On paper though, they look good."

dean815,"For all the talk of losing weapons it sure seems like Bradford is going to have a whole fucking arsenal next year. Matthews, Agholor, Ertz, Murray, Sproles, Mathews, Celek, Pooper. He should have a good shot if he stays healthy. "
dean815,"That article references [this Yahoo! piece](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--sources--new-orleans-saints-kept-a--ledger--detailing-weekly-earnings-in-bounty-scandal.html) which first stated that three players were awarded $1000 for cart offs in the Bills game that year, which was incorrect, then was changed to the Panthers game, also incorrect. 

There were not any injuries to Panthers offensive players in that game so I don't know how that information can be considered legitimate. In the case of the Giants game, there was an injury to their right tackle but since he left with a pulled muscle in his groin I can't imagine they would have paid bounties for something not caused by a Saints player under the alleged circumstances."

dean815,It's tough to say. Jim Brown played in a time where he was indisputably the best athlete on the field at all times. If he played in the same era as Barry Sanders it'd be a different story. Barry was an incredible athlete as well but I think his game relied less on his physical traits. If you watch highlights of Jim Brown there are plenty of plays where he gets to the second level and just starts running through people.
dean815,Deuce McAllister was signed as an honorary captain (and actually took up a roster spot) in the 2009-2010 playoffs when we won the Super Bowl and then retired shortly after. I thought it was a really cool move by the team.

dean815,"The Bountygate wikipedia has a decent succinct analysis of the story, allegations, punishment, appeal, and aftermath. 

Only one Saints fan wrote a comment in here so far and wrote a very in-depth analysis of the situation but has been downvoted into the shitter without a single response refuting any of his arguments. Biased as he may be there are very few NFL players, coaches, analysts, etc who don't think the investigation was a complete joke. Not a shred of evidence has been presented to the public. On top of that, even if every allegation were true, the punishment was unprecedented and over the top. Upon appeal, former commissioner Tagliabue was brought in as an arbitrator and vacated the player suspensions. Jonathan Vilma and several other players appeared in front of a jury and the jury agreed with his case but ultimately ruled that there was no legal action that could be pursued due to the power afforded to the commissioner in the CBA. 

I understand you shouldn't just take everything at face value coming from a fan of the team in question but there are a ton of legitimate concerns with the way the NFL handled the situation. "

- relatively easy schedule based on last year's results

**Won't:**

- Their division isn't as easy as people seem to think

- Jameis still hasn't played a snap in the NFL yet

- Their offensive line was reeeeeally bad last year

- Not sure Lovie is the right coach for this team

- VJax is starting to age and may age further this year"
dean815,"Anybody *could* win it, but there's no statistic or logical reason to think it would be anyone but Seattle at this point. IMO Rams and Cards are about even with slim chances to win the division and the 49ers have a tough road.

dean815,"Atlanta killed it. After a weak free agency, a strong draft class gives them a better chance to overtake the Panthers or Saints this year.

Carolina had a confusing draft. Shaq Thompson could give them the strongest LB corps on the NFL if he plays to his full potential but I'm not sure an upgrade there could even possibly be better value than investing in Cam Newton's safety behind their awful offensive line. I'm not certain Devin Funchess was the right receiver for this team because of his similar build and play style to Kelvin Benjamin. Finding someone like Tyler Lockett or Philip Dorsett might have been a bigger help.  

Tampa Bay's draft obviously hinges on Jameis Winston's play. Personally I don't think they needed to take a QB as certainly as others thought. Trading down to double up and continue building a quality team around Glennon might have paid off better in the long run, but if Winston is as good as scouts project, they are suddenly a contender. 

The Saints had some confusing picks in my opinion. I have trouble rationalizing passing on Bud Dupree and Devante Parker at 13 especially when we really do have two above average offensive tackles but more offensive line help for a team trying to improve in the run game won't hurt. I think Stephone Anthony is an absolute home run at 31. I don't know much about Kikiha but hopefully he can bring the same explosiveness to the Saints. Overall we got quality depth at CB and LB, two of our biggest need positions, but failed to find a WR in a deep draft. Hopefully the team thinks they have a breakout player in Brandon Coleman, Nick Toon, or Seantavius Jones, because we enter the season very thin at WR. "
dean815,"It's shitty because once it has a -gate attached, you might as well call the executioner. You can't exactly refer to it as bountygate without implying guilt, and the term takes off, and the media calls it an open and shut case."
dean815,FOOTBALL
dean815,"Basically, yeah"
dean815,People think he sucks. How is he overrated?
dean815,Doesn't change my stance that he is an underrated and above average run blocker. Just explains why his volume of run blocking snaps is low. 
dean815,"Thomas Morstead. One of the best punters in the league year in and year out. Even though he doesn't have to do it that often, he's lights out when we do need him.

Also Pierre Thomas because he's Pierre fuckin' Thomas."
dean815,Sure. Would've been more interesting with Gregg Williams around
dean815,lol cap space
dean815,What about NYJ?
dean815,"ah. that was a sneaky one, friend"
dean815,Marshawn Bills jersey would be fun though. And cheaper
dean815,"~~This doesn't work because it gives equal weight to each season in terms of the ratio when in reality you need to add up each pass to get their career ratio.

Example-Rodgers should be 6.5/1.6=4.0625 which are his career percentages~~

Misread the OP. It's TD% *minus* INT% and I had been using division. That clears it up. I'm a dingus. "
dean815,"Yeah Falcons, spread that roster nice and thin just how daddy likes it"
dean815,Also lost Borland. Also lost harbaugh. 
dean815,Bryce Petty. Watched a lot of pre draft stuff on him. Dude reminds me of a golden retriever. And he landed somewhere where playing time isn't out of the question. Not a lot of rookie qb's can say that.
dean815,Kind of makes it a weirdly specific and pointless discussion then
dean815,Dang Matt Ryan is a Packers fan?!
dean815,Not on purpose tho
dean815,I don't see it. Lovie Smith has a hell of a lot less ties with the Bucs and he's still there after last year's shitshow. They'd have to be really bad for at least another year or two. 
dean815,"Giants have 4 prime time games, same amount as the 49ers despite having 10x bigger local market"
dean815,"True. Undoubtedly some of those sacks were issues with him or his receivers not being on the same page, but the o-line has been real bad."
dean815,"Edit: it is entirely probable that Tom Brady asked the balls to be deflated. My main problem here is that the context has been blown out of proportion by a hungry media and I hope the disciplinary committee doesn't overreact as a result. 

I'll say it again: the whole report was filled with ambiguous and pointed language. It doesn't make any firm conclusions but strongly favors the idea that the Pats were guilty. All this media tension has brought the case to a boiling point and now the two employees have been cast as villains and had their personal lives exposed. This is going to completely ruin those two guys lives, at least for a bit, and all over a couple tenths of an ounce because ~~the Colts organization~~ Indianapolis media (?) chose to whine about the Patriots crushing them again. 

Most importantly, the NFL paid these guys to look into it. The NFL controls the entire process and could have had them write whatever they want. Not sure this was a ""stinger"" but the whole thing kind of sucks and honestly it has become way overblown and will be an unfair stain on Brady's incredible career. Having been told countless times that the Saints ""didn't deserve their SB win"" after the league's hilariously weightless accusations and seeing my team fall apart without their head coach during the most promising period in franchise history, I can sympathize with this situation.

I can't stress enough that, having worked in a law firm for a while, many high-level attorneys are no smarter than the average person and are often working on cases in which they have absolutely zero knowledge of the subject at hand. I've had to go to an attorney's office who was working on an intellectual property case for a top 5 tech company because his computer wouldn't turn on. The power strip it was plugged into was turned off. I understand not everyone gets technology but when you are working on a tech patent case you should be able to understand basic electricity flow. Seems like this may be a similar case, at least according to Brady's agent.

Fuck this whole process. I hate it more than the Falcons. "
dean815,Cro would be an upgrade at #1 for several teams. Revis would be an upgrade at #1 for almost every team. That's a pretty good start. 
dean815,Vernon Davis. motherfucker plays the game of his life against us in the playoffs in 2012 and then does jack shit for my fantasy team the next year

**Won't**

-I'm sorry to be such a hater and I really do like you guys but I think the Titans are the worst team in football this year

-The Colts look poised to take the division without much resistance

dean815,"I read the parts of it that I have a problem with. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess 90+% of people didn't read the entire report word for word, and I'm going to guess you didn't either.

dean815,Martavis Bryant was like mini Moss this year in terms of impact per target. Ridiculous how many TDs and big plays that dude had. 
dean815,Ill take 07 Brady or 13 Manning over any Rodgers season thus far
dean815,Can't say that after last season. He was injured and the secondary was really bad but doesn't change the level of production. He's close but can't have him in top 5.
dean815,Arian Foster
dean815,"Jimmy Garoppolo 

edit: yeah you guys are probably right"
dean815,"I don't think he'll be the most improved player on our team. Kenny Vaccaro, Josh Hill, Akiem Hicks should bounce back. Cooks was doing really well before he was injured. "

dean815,"**Will:**

-Despite lacking a starting-caliber QB, they have built a very talented roster that features a top-5 offensive line and a very good secondary.

-They have lots of rising talent on offense in Crowell, West, Hawkins, and Gabriel. Hawkins was one of the most underrated players in the league last year IMO

-If Johnny Manziel and Josh Gordon find the field and play at even half the talent level they've shown, this team is a serious contender for the AFC North

-They were in the lead for the division last year as late as week 10 at 6-3, before losing 6 of their last 7 games en route to the bottom of the division. (edited)

-Mike Pettine is a pretty good fit at HC from what I've seen

**Won't**

-There is a very real possibility they will enter the season with Josh McCown as their starting QB. Ask the Bucs how that went.

-The team has character issues up and down the roster, Gordon and Manziel are obvious but Isaiah Crowell has also dealt with personal issues although he stayed on the field last year.

-While promising young players are there, they lack a true playmaker on offense with Gordon likely sidelined for the year

-The run defense was really bad last year. Worst in the league. If Danny Shelton isn't a force by day 1 that could be a huge issue in a division that featured three of the premier rushing attacks in the league last year."

dean815,"this happened a few days ago. you really think all the eagles, cowboys, and giants fans were going to let this slide all weekend?"
dean815,The Saints organization and the city of New Orleans love Payton more than any team in the league except maybe New England and Bill Belichick. He'd have to really fuck up to get the boot. They are already going to lose Brees in a few years tops so I don't think they are going to kick out the other pillar of their franchise anytime soon. 
dean815,I don't think the team will necessarily be worse in the long haul but losing Murray definitely hurts their offense. The line was filthy but Murray also led the league in yards after contact. Only 12 players had more total rushing yards than he did after contact.
dean815,awkward
dean815,"If your team plays bad football, people are going to make jokes about them. We've all been there except the younger Pats fans. We're eagerly waiting..."
dean815,Agreed. Is he supposed to be bringing the same scheme or is he going to work around the personnel? They are going to get absolutely annihilated underneath if they play cover 3.
dean815,"Y'all won a lot of close games last year. We lost a lot of close games. Our aging QB isn't coming off an ACL tear. Yours (less than a year younger) is coming off an ACL tear. Your team lost your DC, starting CB2, starting NT and DT(although dockett missed last year), top two tight ends, and is losing several veterans on the defense who may not be missed on the playing field but might have an impact as lost leaders ( foote, abraham, washington(potentially could play), dockett). We experienced a similar turnover with veterans last year and it was a difficult transition. On top of all that, y'all have the fifth toughest schedule by SOS next year and we have the fifth easiest. 

I have definitely been wrong before but from my perspective folks are a bit too high on the Cards and a bit too low on the Saints. I probably do have the Cardinals a bit low but like I said, a lot of those middle spots are interchangeable and most likely determined by injuries. "
dean815,I like you
dean815,That is a good point. Figured they would have addressed it earlier in the draft but I can't claim to know much about the depth at tackle in the draft.
dean815,"It went in a span of hours from an Indy sportswriter declaring that the Pats used deflated balls to many people taking it with no hesitation whatsoever and saying the Pats should be banned, Belichick suspended, etc. without any sort of investigation.

dean815,It bothers me less than having it shoved in my face again on /r/nfl
dean815,"I think Colston's age and losing Graham makes our WR3 battle really interesting. 

Seantavus Jones and Brandon Coleman are two big guys that the organization hopes can fill Colston's role when he retires. 

Joe Morgan was a poor man's Kenny Stills before we had Kenny Stills but ran into a bunch of off the field issues and got back on the team this year for a few games. 

We also signed Josh Morgan this offseason in what I can only imagine was a joke to confuse other teams when looking at our depth chart. 


The battle for nickel corner could be interesting as well. We'll likely play more than half our snaps with 5+ DBs so you could consider the eventual winner of that battle a starter. We're hopeful for PJ Williams to make an immediate impact but we have quite a few guys who are going to be battling for that spot. Many Saints fans (myself included) are hoping that we see a lot of ""big nickel"" packages, where SS Kenny Vaccaro slides into the nickel/slot role and backup FS Rafael Bush plays two deep with Byrd. I think the Saints were looking for versatility on defense to help emphasize Rob Ryan's crazy schemes and we're hoping that Stephone Anthony is the perfect anchor in the center of the defense with so many moving parts."
dean815,We have definitely seen his best. He ain't touchin' that record of his. He very well may be one of the best WRs in the league again this year but I can't imagine he plays that well again.

Teams like the Pats, Hawks, and Packers get the benefit of the doubt because they've had drafts that looked terrible at the time, but turned out great. I think as of right now it's very fair to say the Seahawks just had a bad draft. Of course it's 2 years too early to tell, but that doesn't mean we should just assume it will turn out ok for those teams because it did in 2012 (or whatever year you compare it to)"

jrg114,"Yeah sure... as long as every time he does it he makes sure to toot his own horn saying, "" I was right with RG3 for the first year and I was right about Geno and Ponder, etc..."" He's not terrible if he actually gets to the point literally his last 2 pieces about Mariotta vs. Winston, instead he just talked about all the picks he got right and almost got right."
jrg114,Shit!!! I wanted him!!!
jrg114,"In the last quarter of the season he was 71/109 with 1001 yards. 6 TDs and 2 INTs (1 fumble). With an average passer rating of 104.45.

jrg114,"Patriots: Really shitty offseason all around, but they'll still probably be in the AFC championship game.

Dolphins: Really liked the Stills trade and the Suh signing, and the Parker Phillips and Ajayi picks. They are the favorites of the non-pats teams to make the playoffs.

Bills: Didn't like the mccoy trade. Rex signing is gonna be good for them, their fanbase and organization needs him. Clay and Harvin pick ups don't really impress me. Their QB situation regressed, but we'll see about that. Terrible draft, but they didn't have a first rounder (or 4th i believe) so you let it go. Overall I don't see them being very good 5-11 / 6-10 worst in the division."
jrg114,"send?

Wilk is top 5-7 at DE

Rich is top 5

BMarsh is still probably top 8 or 9 (and that's on a down year)

Mangold's top 3

Revis is well top 1

Decker, Brick, and Cro were all iffy but Cro was a pro-bowler

Our team is really stacked it's just our QB situation is so horrible every one counts us out"
jrg114,Jarvis Landry and Martavis Bryant would be my choices
jrg114,"Hey, when it's not an every year occasion you cherish it

Then again there were those AFC championship years"
jrg114,"Yeah, to me I can't see any of them doing it without a QB, and as great as their draft was this year, Browns have shown an organization wide inability to develop a QB... So i'll go with them"

So my best friend asked me one day what teams I was a fan of and being the scared, follower that I was, I just agreed with all of is favorite teams.

 However, at the time he asked me this something that also weighed heavily in my decision was the thought of the U.S. Air Force vs. Mythical Giants and somehow my imagination decided that the Jets won."

Revis... who is arguable, but probably not the answer compared to Bailey or Primetime or Rod Woodson.

So here's my question, I don't have some extensive knowledge of the history of the center position. I wonder if Mangold has a reason to be in this discussion because he is generally recognized as a great Center and has been so reliable. However he also has never won or been to a SB. Basically I just don't know enough Centers historically to say if he's in the discussion."

If you want to get depth in a young RB draft pick it's one thing. But adding guys just to add them when u already hav similar style better backs is just dumb"
jrg114,"I'm also biased, and I also think we're debating the lesser of two evils here...

That being said I think the Bills QB situation is worse. As much as he gets shit on for the ""pro bowl flashes"", Geno isn't wrong in saying he's had moments where he's looked like a very good QB.

EJ Manuel I can't say the same for.

Matt Cassell and Fitzamgic are about even. personally after seeing his 6 td game and hearing about his intelligence I'd prefer Fitzmagic, but I think You could go either way on that and no one would really disagree."

The Browns just aren't good enough yet, and I don't believe in JFF. In time, My friend.

Texans (young, good, cheap, just need a QB)

Vikings (Teddy Bridgewater is the future, Young, good, cheap)

Panthers (Cam, Young, good, cheap)

These 3 teams all have problems to their team which is why they won't win now, but they are young and cheap enough to where they could win in the future if they drafted and played FA well.
"
jrg114,"I wouldn't be so sure about that,  while the face of their team has changed from a defensive presence to an offensive presence, they are still good.

Our starting CBs were Marcus Williams and Darrin Walls while Kyle Orton was playing like Peyton  (part of the reason I think it's idiotic to say Cassell = Orton).

Eric Decker also had injuries all year which played into it."

I was about 5 and at the time I had no interest in pro sports beyond a general knowledge that they occurred.

My Best friend asked me what teams I rooted for (being that I live in Long Island this is a commonly asked question because all the sports have at least 2 teams).

So at this point in my life there were 3 things that weighed heavily on my decision making of whether to become a Jets fan or a Giants fan (having already chosen Mets and the Knicks being the incumbent)

1. Jets rhymed with Mets

2. My best friend was a Jets fan and I still wanted only to be just like him so we could be BFFs (still are best friends so it worked out)

I was on r/patriots and posted in a thread about TB's lawyer looking to cross-examine witnesses. I said it wasn't a good idea because it would have to be done in a court of law and then the NFL could subpoena Brady's phone records. I got a lot of shit for saying that..."

Every one says the miami game was an anomaly which I agree with, but so was the 3 int Buffalo game, which every1 seems to think is the real Geno. Geno is in a better system, with better weapons, a better (offensive) head coach and OC. With (minorly) better protection. Don't even get me started on how bad our talent in 2013 was. I think Geno will put up numbers somewhat similar to what Hoyer did in 2014 which will have won him the job over Fitzpatrick in preseason"

jrg114,"It was not a smart move, that draft was full to the brim with receiving talent. Doug Whaley traded up to get Sammy Watkins who in reality was just in the mix that was the great receiver draft we had last year. 

Should they land Collins all will be forgotten, but that doesn't fix the draft they had this year, which could have been a lot better. 

Now on the subject of Collins, they are not the only team to speak to Collins since he was cleared. In all likelihood, probably all 32 teams have. If not the Cowboys, Eagles, etc... then probably 28-24 teams who still need an OT or an OG have had contact with him. The Bills aren't special in this matter, they were just willing to do it without contacting his agent first."

jrg114,I didn't mind his way of doing it as long as he drafted well. Sheldon Richardson is really good but his 2014 draft was bad. 12 picks (albeit late picks) and after 1 year there are 2 productive players (maybe 3 if Bowles staff is very good) in our future
jrg114,"Fair enough, however last year in preseason Geno looked significantly improved to the level of Andy Dalton. Obviously not so, but I watched every snap from both of them and seeing Vick play in real games, no chance he would've won the competition."

jrg114,"what's to stop him from retiring, then unretiring and signing with whoever he wants?

Edit: thanks for the replies basically contract freezes if they decide to un retire"
jrg114,YES!! our starting corners were an UDFA rookie and a converted 4th round safety!!! You don't realize how bad our secondary was cuz Rex did a nice job covering it up against the Pats (and only the pats mind you).

jrg114,"I've talked about this before, but here is the shorter summary...

Overrated Defense with bad overall HC (great DC)

Bad OC

Injury Prone over the hill RB behind a bad O line who is meant to play in space (Chip Kelly System)  but will be grounding N pounding down the middle (Roman/Rex Ryan Offense).

Bad QB's all around. Kyle Orton played out of his mind last year before retiring and everyone is acting like external things carried him. He was playing great last year. Matt Cassel or EJ can't come close to how he played last year.

Overrated additions in Percy and Charles Clay

Charles Clay is not that good and the Bills overpaid for him.

Percy Harvin is another example of an athlete disguising himself as a football player. He's really more of an extremely athletic scat back. He can't run routes. He tells his QB's to force him the ball to him(3 Int game from Geno).

Your O line is still god awful and is just about 15x times worse than Philly which is why  Shady will do poorly in Buffalo (along with scheme and other stuff I mentioned).

Have I mentioned that Rex Ryan might be the worst coach in the NFL at 

1.Developing players

2.Offense

3.Late game situations

4.Winning games against teams other than the Patriots (which he still didn't do too often)."

Not a chance I have the Dolphins winning the division. Sorry man, but QB is everything in the NFL and like it or not they have a pretty good one.

&gt;Rex Ryan and Greg Roman are a big upgrade over Marrone and Hackett.

Wrong again, Rex took a contender in '09 and '10 and systematically broke it down and destroyed it. He's just not that good a head coach.

I didn't call the first guy a homer at all. I said it's ridiculous to have Linsley over Frederick and that I didn't know about Bakhtiari over some other guys, he replied and said he didn't go too far in depth, and I said cool that's fine MY B. 

Mr. adv then decided to call me a homer because the back up TE on the team I chose was Jace Amaro compared to Zach Ertz who are comparable and I could see Amaro developing better in the coming years. 

Trust me I don't ever try to be rude on the internet (except maybe to Bills fans they kinda piss me off)."

Marshall is not good hes very good and was injured now hes healthy. 

Kerley is better than woods 

Smith and Amaro are young and promising.

Bills Wr's include Watkins, that's it. Harvin is an athletic freak but hes more of a wild cat weapon forced to play the receiver position because nothing else fits him. I saw Harvin play plenty of games under Rex and he basically jus wasted downs and forced Geno to throw to him when he wasn't open (all 3 Int's to Buffalo in the Game Geno was benched were to Percy)"

TL;DR - Too good at too many positions w/ too much depth, 19-0 hype train incoming! CHOO! CHOO!

Geno Smith progressing in a simpler system with less reads (his biggest problem), more movement (a big asset), and a coach and OC who actually believe in him and don't have a tendency to ruin QBs.

**Defense**:

D line;

Leo 

Damon

Mo 

Sheldon

good veteran depth Mac Daddy signed

LBers;

Calvin Pace

Lorenzo Mauldin (loved this pick for back story but more importantly ability)

David Harris

Quinton Coples

Demario Davis

Developing Enkempali looks to be pretty good

CBs; 

Marcus Williams

Dee Milliner

Dex McDougle

Buster Skrine

Antonio Cromartie

Revis

(our starting CBs last year were Antonio Allen and Marcus Williams when AA was healthy when he wasn't Phillip Adams was in there)

S;

Antonio Allen

Jaiquawn Jarrett

Calvin Pryor

Marcus Gilchrist

Now that's a scary Defense with some scary depth.

**Offense**:

QBs; 

Geno (Mr Pro Bowl flashes/ perfect passer rating himself!)

Fitzpatrick (competent backup if Geno falls short)

-------------------------------

Simms (Not sure why we keep him around, but hey I like him)

Petty (if he was a time zone his name would be The Future)

WRs / TEs;

Devier Posey

Devin Smith

Jermey Kerley (AKA mini black Jason Witten)

Eric Decker

Stevan Ridley ( Riddles / The Riddler . You decide)

Bilall Powell

Zac Stacy

Coaches;

Todd Bowles - AKA assistant coach of the year, blitzer and defensive tactician extraordinaire, some would say the Anti-Rex (in terms of brovado and media attention and possibly player accountability). 

Chan Gailey -  offensive master mind and Geno's puppet master bending him to his will to make sure he can't fuck up.

1 of these is not like the others.

But seriously Alex Smith is just as good as Peyton right? RIGHT?!?!?!"
jrg114,"That sounds like a them problem, their job is to warn said player not to tackle him off of Mangold. He literally had to move the guy"
jrg114,"That's not how this goes man, I would've really liked for the Jets to draft Andrew Luck. It just so happens he was gone by then. Name some one your team could've picked when they were picking and did not, you ass."

jrg114,"Yes I really love Matt Ryan and I think they will be good this year

I want to see how the lions rebound from losing their dt's and their offense wasn't very good last year even though they had megaton and Tate

jrg114,Chip Kelly's system + an abundance of quality or good receivers can make a QB look pretty good. Just look at Mariota
jrg114,"look how they went 12-4 2 years ago, they will bounce back"
jrg114,"Chip's wild ride scares me, I don't want a guy making 15 different moves in the same offseason.

Overpayed for Maxwell ( I still maintain that the LOB aren't all as good as they seem, but when you have them all together they play like #1's. Probably the only true #1 at his position in the LOB is ET3)

traded away Foles for a more injury prone Bradford (who StL was looking to get rid of and got picks in return) That move is boom or bust and I think it will be bust, I just don't believe his body can hold up in the NFL

Seemed like he was willing to do just about anything to get Mariota

traded away an injury prone aging RB to sign an injury prone aging RB (even though I actually really liked that trade cuz alonso is gonna be rly good)


Edit: Like I said I trust him as a coach, I just wouldn't feel good giving him autonomy

jrg114,"Mac Daddy is the real deal, and he can turn our Franchise completely around. I am in love with the job he's done so far.

Step 1 - Free Agency; Over spent on some guys a lil' to remake that secondary but all the guarantees were 1 year so they're basically prove it deals (excluding Revis).

Step 2 - Draft; Knocked it out of the fucking park, grand slam see ya later. 

Step 3 - Trades; turned a 5th rounder into Brandon Marshall and Zac Stacy. Traded down to get another 5th and 7th and took Mauldin (the 5th was used to get Harrison and the 7th was traded to move up and get Petty).

Could not be happier with Mac Daddy as of this moment, However now it's Super Bowles' turn. I'm almost non-cautiously excited, which is the best I've felt about this team in years

Sure maybe Ridley and Stacy aren't better than Ivory but they're probably as good or close which means more depth with equal talent, more competition; better product. Also it means everyone remains healthier taking less snaps.

I'm sick of this ""(x) receiver can't throw to himself"" Everyone in the NFl is there for a reason they can all get the ball out. When Geno had 2 legitimate weapons on the field his TD/Int was 6/3. BMarsh isn't just a legit target he's a #1 which the Jets haven't had in years. Harvin wasn't even a very good receiver and Geno improved drastically with him on the field (excluding the bills game where he forced the ball to Percy). Making a blanket statement like ""No one can throw the ball to him"" is ridiculous. Maybe you should take a look and see why Geno had so much trouble. Geno had trouble reading D's quick enough for 3 reasons...

1. His eyes are about 1/2 second too slow

2. his receivers **never** got any seperation from coverage

3. The O Line didn't hold up protection for more than 2 seconds and most of the time there was a rusher on him by the time he finished his drops

Next time you make some dumb blanket statement at least think about it"

jrg114,god damn it I hate it when Front offices are smart and players make team friendly contracts!
jrg114,"Nothing too special, just some weed, and Grimes is better."
jrg114,"Prime Mike Vick, Prime Ray Lewis"
jrg114,"Yeah, what will their awful 4 man front ever do against Colts beast run game"
jrg114,Great football I.Q. and work ethic too
jrg114,or anyone in the NFL
jrg114,"Tomsula just became a HC, no chance he's on any hot seat."
jrg114,Yet their D was their catalyst last year and it was the first time they made the playoffs in a while....
jrg114,Jaelen Strong must have an STD from fucking something up really badly
jrg114,"Not relinquishing our position immediately

Cause and effect"
jrg114,Rex went from NYC coaching the Jets to Buffalo (do they even have electricity? Has it stopped snowing there?) coaching the Bills
jrg114,"Eli

He gets underrated a lot on r/NFL. I really like Eli and love him in the playoffs"
jrg114,"&gt; Romo, he is the better QB with an hour and a half in the pocket

FTFY

"
jrg114,"The Jets starting offer for Mo was 2 1st rounders (probably high ones) so going off that (including that it's a high price) you'd probably at least have to give up a 1, a 2 +"
jrg114,"Giants

Give Teddy another year or 2 to develop before he does some significant damage in the league"
jrg114,"Jarvis Harrison has a very good chance to be our starting RG

has all the physical attributes and ability and has shown it on the field. Not committed or determined enough, hopefully Bowles can fix that"
jrg114,"I think they're good enough to be a #1, not the #1 at the position IMO sherm is 2nd or 3rd among CB's and Kam is probably 2nd behind Mccourty"
jrg114,"Richard Sherman isn't the no.1 CB in the NFL, he might not even be in the top 3.

Personally I'd take Revis, Davis, Grimes, and CH jr over him"
jrg114,I say we hang him in town square
jrg114,"Damn!

Back to the drawing board..."
jrg114,"Nah my rankings for 2015-16 for the NFCE are

NYG

Dal

Wsh"
jrg114,"Having someone between Paysinger and Jenkins, besides Olivier Vernon has done very good opposite Wake

Edit: or a coach who isn't mediocre bound"
jrg114,"Ya IK, Big Mac is still in my heart for using a 5th to get BMarsh and Zac Stacy"
jrg114,"Phillip Rivers isn't getting younger and has also showed no signs of willingness to extend/resign. Weddle is holding out now, and a lot of players are going to feel the transition to LA for the first 2-3 years. Once the whole team is drafted into LA it will become much smoother, and like I already said you're franchise QB  is on his way out of SD/the league"
jrg114,"Ya I don't know, but from what I've heard from Pats fans is that Josh Daniels and Jimmy G are being groomed to be BB and Brady carbon copies"
jrg114,"or because he's wrong. Everyone has their own reason for wanting to play on a certain team. 

Phillip Rivers wants to stay in SD or go to Tennessee. 

Eli Manning hated the SD FO

Manning wanted to be taken under Elway's wing"
jrg114,"They're *about* even in playoff ability and Joe Flacco is more stable during the reg season.

that being said I like and appreciate Eli more than most on r/nfl"
jrg114,"Jets... 

I'm not sour I'm just very disappointed and disgusted in the legal system that someone who did such a horrible thing to a child is making millions in their mansion"
jrg114,Mangold's is better
jrg114,Breaking: My ass cheeks  
jrg114,"The leonard Williams pick was our fork in the road now we can't stop fighting. If it makes you feel better I really do like and respect you, just disagree about Vic Beasley v. Leonard Williams"
jrg114,Joel Bitonio was drafted as an OT and Scherff drafted as an OG so you can switch those
jrg114,Well your certainly allowed to have an opinion...
jrg114,"ummm, could we not?

Edit: this would mean all the top tier D lines are in the AFC"
jrg114,"flip a coin

seriously though it's probably point differential "
jrg114,Buffalo will not live up to the hype. I see them going 6-10 or 5-11
jrg114,"Sammy Watkins

OC who loves to run the ball

bad QB situation

offensively inept HC

don't even get me started on Sanjay Lal, the guy could turn Jerry Rice into Stephen Hill"
jrg114,"Browns will be most entertaining

Rams or Texans will yield the best QB"
jrg114,"I think he'd do well if used correctly. Rex and Morninwheg had no idea had to use him. One game he'd get 40 carries up the gut (MIA@NYJ). The next he'd get 2 carries and be thrown screens 30 times with 3 guys on him. 

As it happened far too often in the Rex era, CJ2K became CJ2YPC because he was used incorrectly"
jrg114,"PSA for all the Rams fans about to get mad:

It wouldn't have mattered, all that would have happened is he would've declined to sign. Then because he was drafted he would wait for the draft next year"
jrg114,"If we're doing the Rookie all-injured team we've already got 

Randy Gregory

Fowler

Jaelen Strong

Shane Ray

Todd Gurley

Ifo Ekpre - Olomu

TJ Clemmings

Devin Funchess

Shaq Thompson

Cedric ogbuehi

Damarius Randall

Jeff Heuerman

Add on to the list if you think of someone else"
jrg114,"Listen I don't disagree with you that we need a QB, but to say we wouldn't win those games because of the QB is ridiculous. Geno led the team 2x to FG opportunities to beat the pats, not his fault they didn't seal the win. also last year our team had 6-7 very iffy 1 lead games (Den@NYJ was a a 1 TD lead b4 a pick 6). I'm not saying we'll be great, or even good, but 5-11 is insane for this roster"
jrg114,"He's not top 10 in my book. Give Jay Cutler, EJ Manuel, Mark Sanchez that run game and D they'd be pretty good too"
jrg114,"Yes, and I think it will be the Titans because Mariota isn't quite ready to start day 1"
jrg114,"All the reasons I wanted him for the Jets, and I agree totally (NO is one of the best places he could've landed)"
jrg114,"I really doubt he goes anywhere but NO, but if anyone can get it done Mac Daddy can"
jrg114,"It feels like this has been the longest offseason ever, oh how I miss the regular season or any type of season for that matter"
jrg114,"He had twice as many targets as Amaro last year with a much better...

1.QB

2.Supporting cast in receivers / O line

3.The almighty Chip Kelly's system

Consider me unimpressed"
jrg114,Darelle Revis won a SB with the Patriots and I can't be fucking salty!!! Outrageous!!!
jrg114,Does any1 know what the Jets got back in the trade?
jrg114,"Geno's accuracy isn't terrible it's his decision making you should chew out

Jay Cutler/Geno Smith decision making has to go up there"
jrg114,"John Idzik 

smh..."
jrg114,The dress was White and gold...
jrg114,"With the Lions I didn't have anything major in mind, but a minor regression was in order. Losing Suh and Fairley will hurt your D over all, and your schedule is tougher. 

Yes if you're offense plays to it's full potential you guys could win the NFC, the thing is that it has never carried the lions. Your O was the weaker part of your team last year with IMO the best WR duo in the game. All of that amounts to a 2 game regression, nothing huge , but a regression it is."
jrg114,"I know I wrote it that way cuz im lazy, now leave me alone you, you, you intelligent person, yeah take that you smart man, god damn it I need to work on this trash talk thing."
jrg114,"Ya, but it was only about Rivals, so i left out Mac Daddy's offseason championship"
jrg114,"Or.....

I'll give you 

QB: Brady

RB: Shady, Ivory

WR: Marshall, Watkins, Decker, Edelman, Parker, Landry

jrg114,So who's ready to put the 3rd day on as background to whatever you're really doing?
jrg114,MARIATO
jrg114,At least you can hav solace in the fact the only reason you and your patriot Cohorts are being outnumbered is because you're trying to piss off 3 fan bases rather than the usual 1

jrg114,"&gt;the 2014 Jets secondary

jrg114,"I agree but if no1 has any offense in the division than it becomes interesting

Very much like how until Car remade their secondary last year no1 in the NFCS had any D"
jrg114,"who the fuck still uses facebook?

Edit: Adults completely ruined that shit"
jrg114,"I'm busy for July. My schedule opens up in August, does that work for you?"
jrg114,I'd give Ben probably 5-6 years and don't forget Leveon he is going to  haunt your mind for years. I love how good and balanced he is at all aspects of being a running back
jrg114,I messed up... Never Again
jrg114,maybe about 1/100 measure of the standard caring ratio
jrg114,"I liked Ertz a lot last year, this year I was very unimpressed and from what I saw from Amaro, he needs to work on his composure but could be really really good. 

you might noticed I put him behind Travis Kelce because that's who I consider the 2 best tight ends out of those 2 drafts. (Amaro 2nd to Kelce obviously)

Edit: Also I'm sure you're the most unbiased guy around"
jrg114,Rams
jrg114,If only he was playing opposite from JJoe rather than being 3rd wheel to JJoe and Lewis
jrg114,"RG - not worried

RT - not worried

ILB - not worried

QB - well he's the reason everyone predicts we'll go 5-11 so apparently it's a problem"
jrg114,My thought was the opportunity to compete for a starting position on a SB contender
jrg114,Shoulda; coulda; woulda
jrg114,"The problem with this Saints team to me is their D and their pass catchers, and until I see a vast improvement in those areas I will continue to lose faith in the Saints"
jrg114,"Sheldon is better than Mo, so is Mario williams

either of them should replace him

And...

My D line is 

DT's - Gerald Mccoy, Ndamonkong Suh

DE's - JJ Watt, Robert Quinn 

(In this situation I stuck to a 4-3 DL)"
jrg114,"Well that's nice, my hatred says 0-4 but I was fighting it so I settled for 1-3"
jrg114,Gotta be Gregory
jrg114,Bleed em fucking dry Russ I hope you rob them for 30 mil a year. If you let him go the bills jets texans cardinals etc... Will pay him franchise qb $ no problem
jrg114,I think they get anywhere from 5-7 wins this season
jrg114,"Golden Tate was in the Seattle system, he is a big time receiver who was ham-strung by the team mentality and play style. Stafford has 2 great receivers and uses them well but not exceedingly great. Eli got Odell Beckham just last year and we saw what that was like..."
jrg114,"I said my problem was the legal slap on the wrist in the first place I never said it was with is employer, and that he is getting millions does make me sick. That's the legal system's fault in no way is it the Vikings FO fault"
jrg114,"My best guesses would be;

Titans

Redskins

Saints

Browns

Jags

Edit: I would put Bears, but they're still going to have a **Strong** offense and a better D with John Fox, so it's hard for me to see them being No. 1/32"
jrg114,"Cook, Hackenberg, or the OSU starter, which ever one performs the best this year"
jrg114,take Julius Thomas in the 3rd round instead of Kenrick Ellis

jrg114,"&gt; CALLED IT!

It's just too bad that I have no idea who this Stephone **Williams** kid is"
jrg114,This year week 6 Denver @ NYJ was closer than it seemed
jrg114,"QB - Andy Dalton

RB - Chris Ivory

WR - Pierre Garcon / Kendall Wright / Marques Colston

Will edit in more when I think of them
"
jrg114," No, but he didn't need to point it out. We all know the history about SpyGate. Revis should be focusing on helping he young guys in that secondary get better."
jrg114,"exactly man, why would I take you seriously with your well developed detailed argument. You clearly won our little spat between Bradford +Sanchez or Foles, at least we were close to answering the topic of the thread. We'll get 'em next time, and nice talking to you."
jrg114,"Oh yea, well I bet you didn't know Julius Thomas was a Power Forward which helped him jump higher as if he was grabbing a rebound!"
jrg114,"3rd white player, exceptional motor"
jrg114,"The NFC is more top heavy, while the AFC for lack of a better term has a larger ""middle class"". The NFC has probably 5 of the top 8, but the AFC has many more teams with a chance to be 8-8.

This makes the NFC the stronger division"
jrg114,"49ers

Bears

Saints

Chargers

Eagles, because I don't believe in Chip as a GM"
jrg114,"Another 5-11 prediction for the Jets... that's OK keep doubting.

They hate us cuz they anus boys.

19-0 Book it"
jrg114,"For old times sake the classic run up the middle, somehow it gets intercepted"
jrg114, Jimmy Graham and JT have played basketball in case you didn't know /s
jrg114,Yet somehow OBJ is being overhyped. Cmon now r/NFL you're better than this
jrg114,"The scheme and the best Safety tandem in the league. Not to mention how stacked the Seahawks are at every position. I'm not saying he's bad, He's just not no.1 (or 2). It's really hard to look bad when you're surrounded by a top 3 SS,  a top 1 FS, a top 2 MLB, a top 10 OLB (Irvin), and a very effective D line"
jrg114,because damn it I'm not kidding why should Fish be the only ones to have a perfect record. Thank god Tom Deflady and the Pats only went 18-1
jrg114,"I didn't say you were a bandwagon fan. All I said is **some** Seahawk fans forget easily what it was like before Russell, then when people asked I used an example."
jrg114,"poor performances, probably 2 

If were talking full games, I'd put the over/under at 7"
jrg114,They realize they have to go 12 picks in 45 minutes right?
jrg114,We have cookies
jrg114,"Fair enough, like I said purely speculation"
jrg114,Jets forced to extend Geno Smith for 3 years as a favor to Robert Kraft
jrg114,"geNOOOOOO, for every other team (except the Dolphins fuck yeah)"
jrg114,I don't know who you're disagreeing with I literally said the same thing
jrg114,Oh of course not no one player is really worth more than 16 mil. I just hope he makes your organization slash and burn everything to fit him under the cap
jrg114,3rd time in what? 36 hours? You're better than this r/NFL
jrg114,"you're making excuses for Jay playing poorly.

I've done it a lot too, but that doesn't make your team better."
jrg114,LES GO!!!!! **BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
jrg114,He was drafted as a tackle and only plays guard because of how stout the browns are at OT
jrg114,"I read this right after the ""Breaking: Ray Mcdonald"" thread so I thought this was also news. I was like holy shit, it's coming to an end what a day to be alive"
jrg114,"&gt; Excluding Special Teams

Well, you tried"
jrg114,Redskins just picked up 4 picks
jrg114,"You've foiled me this time, and I would've gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those rotten kids!!!"
jrg114,"Oh i know. I think he'll stay though, I just have a feeling he'll take 9-10 mil/year and stay. 

Also I love Mac Daddy because he's in the business of getting value and he understands what Wilk's value is"
jrg114,"Patriots.

I will never bet on the spurs to lose until I see it happen, unfortunately the Patriots are in the same boat as the spurs"
jrg114,"Me 2, but we live in a patriot ethno-centric world. If they don't approve you mine as well not say it"
jrg114,I would've taken Eli Harold all the way at the top of the 2nd. There's a reason I'm not a GM
jrg114,I'll keep that in mind thx
jrg114,"Guess they didn't like Tre, didn't see that one coming"
jrg114,"Me too bud, me too. Hey maybe he'll un-retire and go to the Texans or something

#FavreBros4Lyf"
jrg114,"No, not at all, I'm just saying what comes around goes around. You may choose not to throw stones"
jrg114,"I've heard Bartolo Colon is going on a diet so it'd have to be him, I'm sorry he's not in the NFL."
jrg114,Add him to the rookie all-injury list!
jrg114,Agreed but I can dream
jrg114,"umm Pit wins layoff games, trust me I remember those sons of bitches, we could've gone all the way"
jrg114,"Actually no it's not because those games match up perfectly with Geno's progression at the end of the year (I'm not fooling myself into thinking Geno will be good).

Those numbers didn't just happen by accident, Decker and Geno finally figured out how to work well together and Decker got healthy."
jrg114,"I give Brady 3 years and I think Ben has at least 2 after that so I say 5. 

Also it's not just Leveon it's Leveon, AB, Martavis, that O Line, and the fact that I have trust in the Steelers as an organization"
jrg114,"giants will be better, but you're definitely better than the washington whiteskins"
jrg114,"I actually often wonder, you know Alshon Jeffery and Stephen Hill were 2 picks apart. How would their careers have changed if Hill went to the bear and Alshon went to the Jets?

Its Basically the NFL version of Nature Vs. Nurture"
jrg114,"So we keep Mangold and we burn the rest, right?"
jrg114,Not one play. Ever.
jrg114,"After 2019, yeah maybe one or two more years"
jrg114,We have no idea why Strong dropped so far... Contain yourself
jrg114,"Manziel won a bar fight, and Mariota probably never left his apartment so I'm gonna go Manziel"
jrg114,"I agree with Langford, Tre McBride also"
jrg114,"the Geno Smith ^TM

The QB plays horribly for 15 games each season, but during the 16th game of each season against an in division rival they play amazingly leaving your fans in wonder of what it could be like if they were at all consistent 

Edit: Also known to leave said rival hopelessly out of playoff contention at a record of 8-8. Bills be Warned"
jrg114,"I actually often recognize Tom's quick release. It's mainly what has kept him alive so long with such good D lines in the division. 

He is behind an average O line but gets the ball out so quickly none of our lines have time to get to him (too often)"
jrg114,The only white people to be drafted so far played on the same O Line in Missouri
jrg114,"They did everything short of mortgaging the future to obtain a franchise QB, Mac literally went up and down the ladder and talked to every team about trade possibilities. I can't blame someone for being put in a place without the opportunity to get a QB. We heard what Tennessee was asking for the #2. Not a chance Mac would've payed out like that to move up 4 spots especially because it didn't sound like they were that in love with Mariota anyways. Most people had either us or someone else taking the bait and jumping on either Petty or Hundley in the 2nd round. Mac stayed calm, stuck to his big board and got Petty in the 4th round to sit for a year or 2, progress, learn the game and eventually become the franchise QB."
jrg114,That's probably because you have to be able to catch the ball to play receiver

jrg114,I'm looking at you; Panthers fans...
jrg114,"Sanchez I'll give you, Rex screwed him because he can't develop QB's for his life.

Tebow, really we're going with this. Where is Tebow since then? You can't ruin something that was never good.

Vick was horrible in pre season and during the season he lost the competition and decided to accept being a backup to Geno.

Let's not even mention that this is a different head coach from those 3 and Fitzy has a broken leg.

I believe you mean TY Hilton Jr.

Who by the way will be sitting behind AJ and the original TY so no he won't get 1100 yards


"
jrg114,"I feel pretty good, 

1.Jets did very well IMO. BPA in Leo(I get some people think BPA is overrated, but I liked the pick **A LOT**) Devin Smith perfect fit for our roster and has all necessary tools to develop really nicely. Mauldin doesn't quite have the burst off the line, but has the work ethic and motor we need, I'd like to see what Bowles can do with him. Really liked drafting Petty to develop for a year or 2. Harrison can be really good if Bowles and Gailey can push him so I really liked that pick. Deon Simon was meh; depth chart filling. Oh and can't forget Mac Daddy turned a 5th round pick into Brandon Marshall and Zac Stacy

2.Dolphins nothing stood out, but nothing was bad. Devante Parker,Jordan Phillips, Cedric Thompson were all solid. What could make or break this draft for the Dolphins was Jay Ajayi in the 5th round. I read he had some bone to bone problem in his knee which could be serious and the reason he dropped, but I think he'll be very good.

3.Patriots did well with Maclcolm Brown (not sure why everyone's calling it a steal though, I had him ranked right around 32 maybe a lil lower.) Also got very good value with Tre Jackson and Shaw Mason. However day 2 was (**ATM**) shit for them

4.Darby and O'leary were good value, but nothing stood out to me as an incredible trade or steal"
jrg114,"so what you're saying is the Jets D line is pretty good... huh interesting theory......

Never would've known according to r/NFL"

jrg114,"I hate that our franchise since Rex becoming HC was known as a laughingstock AKA ""Same Old Jets"""

jrg114,"The majority of them under the age of 29, that's part of what makes them stars.

No one thinks of Nick Mangold a star because his time in the NFL (hopefully not too soon) is coming to a close. At least not off the tip of their tongue they prefer to use Travis Frederick to represent a good center because he has much more time left in the NFL."

Week 1: 

PIT @ NE

New England comes out drunk from their superbowl offseason with no secondary and is picked to shreds by the Trifecta of Atonio Brown Le'veon Bell, and Big Ben (Martavis Bryant will show out as well..)

38 - 28 Steelers

**Stat:** 

Marcus Mariota in his first season throws more interceptions than Jameis Winston

**Team:**

The Buffalo Bills Coming off a high of their 9-7 season, drop very quickly on their way to a dissapointing 5-11 season due to the lack of O Line help, injuries and wear and tear on Lesean Mccoy. Their Defense regressing due to the scheme/ coaching changes to the 12 best defense but not enough to save their putrid offense. Also all their QB's were helpless and not even close to as good as Kyle Orton"
jrg114,"BooHoo us Seahawks and Pats fans our teams were in the SB, everyone feel bad for us.

Highlights are different than ET3 making a post on his website about **Seattle Seahawks** top 5 plays. If it were NFL top 5 plays that's totally diferent. 

For the record I'd say the exact same thing if this were Sheldon richardson was in this post and it was about the Jets or it was Aaron Rodgers posting Packer highlights. 
"
jrg114,"I seem to remember a person by the name of Justin Tuck signing there

**Fatality**"
jrg114,"probably not, but something that gets under my skin because I just need to see him without NFL lite.

one of the things that makes Brady so great to me is that he makes the people around him weapons, they don't make him a good QB.
"
jrg114,"That play, you guys probably know it. The one that gets first downs, we should work on doing that play more often."
jrg114,Ehh... how much money did he make? I'd say mayweather still won
jrg114,"Peyton Manning, the end of an era is upon us"
jrg114,"Nah bro, players don't care if it's 12 mil or 10 mil a year they care about guaranteed money"
jrg114,"We're misunderstood in the idea that Rex embodies our fan base. We're really not nearly as loud and obnoctious as every media member makes us out to be. (even though we're still pretty loud.) With that being said 19-0 incoming, All aboard the Hype Train!

However a lot of Jets fan ( like all new york fans for every sport) are far too reactionary and need to see their teams win now because apparently there is no such thing as rebuilding in New York, or so I've heard.

They would rather have our knicks record from last year and maybe be an 8th seed than be really bad for a couple years and get a possible franchise changing player. "
jrg114,"Your savior beat us on a last ditch 4th down screen pass with a terrible secondary.

Our secondary is now best or 2nd best in the league maybe our D's are just that good and You don't value them enough"

IMO the...

-Redskins

-Browns

-Jets

-Raiders"
jrg114,Well... there are no words that can describe how sorry I feel
jrg114,"Yeah, probably most charismatic guy out of the round. It's great he got taken so early compared to his draft placings. "
jrg114,"If you don't say Broncos, then that's just wishful thinking"
jrg114,"Usually, yes there is. However thanks to our friends Jastremski and McNally (oh and that other guy, his name doesn't come to mind right now) we have deflategate news every 4-7 days minimum"
jrg114,I've had enough of your logic! Throw him in the brig!
jrg114,u/I_Regret_This_Post got it exactly right
jrg114,watch Goodell anounce the pick...
jrg114,"Absolutely, You guys have a top 5 (4th) Secondary. However as Rex Ryan proved last year 1 very good unit on D doesn't make it a good D

I think you guys have a top 10 D just not ""lock down"" as you put it."
jrg114,"OBJ coming into his 2nd year. I bought into this kid I think he's gonna be really good. Cruz is coming back. Their D Line will be legit this year with Hankins, JPP and their 3rd rounder Owa. Their Secondary will be healthy and legit with Landon Collins, DRC, and Amukamara. Their O line will be healthy and has yet another first round pick.

Edit: I also like Eli more than the majority of r/nfl (probably bias because he killed 19-0 for the pats)"
jrg114,"Day 1 - Saints, I can't say them though because I loved their Day 2

Day 2 - Pats, Malcolm Brown was too good

Over all: colts"
jrg114,"there were a couple other guys drafted in 2014 but ok.

Carr"

jrg114,"I'll give you that, but like I said to some one else, Flacco did it one time.  Revis has done it in 3 consecutive seasons."
jrg114,"**1. Brady gets 10 game suspension, reduced to 8**

**2. The Dolphins win the division going 11-5**

**3. Jets Clinch a wildcard going 10-6**

**4. Pats missing Brady and their secondary substantially make it to 8-8**

**5. Bills fall hard right out of the gate, going 5-11**"
jrg114,"Love:

- Rams

- Colts

- Packers

Hate:

- Patriots

- Dolphins

- Seahawks


Edit: This is of course assuming we don't include our favorite team"
jrg114,Only problem with that is in that situation you have 3 DT's because in a 3-4 Sheldon is a DE but in a 4-3 he is a DT
jrg114,He forced his ground n pound style on all his oc's which was not right for cj2k
jrg114,"He's definitely very good, but 1st? Let's be honest with ourselves here. I'd take Poe or Suh over him in a heart beat and probably faster if my heart rate was down at that moment."

jrg114,They're all better and considerably more versatile than Desean
jrg114,"As long as I know that my soul will remain content, lol.

Seriously though, that's all I meant by needing to be reminded of the dark ages"
jrg114,"I want to agree with you,  I just don't. IMO Geno will win the starting job and he'll be pretty good. Not great and not terrible. However I do see us winning significantly more than Buffalo and a couple less than Miami"
jrg114,You already know 19-0 
jrg114,Exactly.
jrg114,"While they're at it they probably combine our teams' name with the other NY team and make us the ""Giant Fucking Jews"". Just so they appease all the fans of course.

Edit: Another possibility of course is...

Giants ----&gt; Giant Noses"
jrg114,"but, but, but, his motor..."

jrg114,and how exactly do you see **this** jets roster becoming the #1 pick?
jrg114,"I didn't say he was good, actually read my comment. 

I said someone will take a look at his abilities and believe in their developing skills enough to add him to their roster."
jrg114,"Because I don't believe in the QB, I really am sorry, but he was a major reach"
jrg114,"As a jets fan, that seems very ""cuz it's the Jets"" ish, and I don't appreciate it because damn it if nothing else Mac Daddy is a god damn Savior. 

Also 4-12 + FA/draft/trade aqcuisitions = 3-13? "
jrg114,I counter you're Laken Tomlinson with my Russel Wilson
jrg114,"So personally it's Devin Smith because I'm hoping and preying he is or develops into more than just a deep threat, also Smith to Smith could be some great TD call in the future (assuming they both improve).

Non-homer pick: OBJ. He has taken the ~~city~~ NFL by storm, as much as I wanted him to be a Jet, I can't be upset the Giants took him first and I think he will be great."
jrg114,"Hey man, you gotta do what you gotta do, I mean we never wouldve got here if it wasn't for...

- The Tuck Rule

- Spy Gate

- Deflate Gate

- Our coach signing with another team and immediately leaving

- Purposely injuring manning all those times, ""What do you mean they don't know about those Bill?"""
jrg114,Agree to Disagree then
jrg114,where the guy started crying is what I assume you're talking about

Honorable Mentions:

Brandon Marshall - got bumped out after a down year last year, hopefully he bounces back

Demario Davis - I feel like He's up there and doesn't get enough respect because of how good our D line is, He's the QB of the D and my fav player. Not quite top 5 *yet*

Damon Harrison - If were going by DT then he isn't quite there. As a nose tackle I think he is second only to Dontari Poe (feel free to correct me)"
jrg114,"Wait... Are you telling me a Pats fan can't take a lil ball busting?

If you prefer them deflated they come in that size as well"
jrg114,maybe.. but I look at those 3 guys and I just think meh which is the same for me as Andy which makes them the Dalton line for me
jrg114,I was fucking furious

because 19-0 hype train  coming into the station

2. Fish because I don't think I could stand BB and Brady winning after this offseason. Also if Rex wins with *that* squad which is not even close to as good to '09 '10 I will be pissed for quite a while. Also someone has to stay in the AFC Beast basement, Bills seem like a prime choice

"

readonlypdf,"What I would give for a safety with those measurements, oh and I do have a question how good are you in reactive situations. 

Do you react well and make quick decisions. 

A WR would work well, safety might be a bit well... difficult at first.

CB (corner back you cover WR's or wide receivers) would be a good introduction to learning both sides of the ball, Zone schemes (where you cover an area of the field) will be good for teaching the skills necessary to play safety, and Man schemes where you attempt to match the WR's movements. Safety is a position where you are the last line of the defense. Your goal is to stop the offense from scoring. you do this by using your brain (something that seems counter intuitive at first) you are essentially playing a mental chess game with the opponents Quarterback (the guy who runs the offense, he makes the decision to throw or run the ball and where it goes). A good way to do this is to adjust coverages PRE Snap. after the snap you have to read the Quarterback. this is judging what the Quarterback is doing. You have to match the QB's movements but you have to be very careful because the quarterback will try to ""look you off"" or make you go where he wants you to be and then put the ball in the other direction. A good way to counter this is to Ignore the eyes. follow the hips, they will square up with the receiver during the actual throw. its harder to see because of the offensive and defensive lines, but you can generally tell whats going on with the QB's body by looking for his Jersey number. this will tell you how his body is oriented. I know this is very complex, but a lot of this becomes instinctual quickly (and is already somewhat there if you played a lot of zone as a CB). Now to be a safety you have to be arguably the Surest Tackler on the team. 

Apologies if this is too in depth.

He pulls a comeback out of his ass. So I have about a minute left with the score 22-20. I run off tackle with Adrian Peterson. Break it into Field Goal Range. Kick the chip shot with 30 seconds left. Brother gets the ball back. He throws a pick. Run out the clock.

While our defense took a step back I think due o a change in scheme it will not be as bad as people think and we still have Belichick, and we will have Brady for AT LEAST 12 games more than likely 14+ (I highly doubt he loses his appeal).

Not only that, but we face the AFC South, the only possible losses I see there are to the Texans and the Colts (tempted not to list the colts for various reasons)

Divisional games possible losses include in Miami and in Buffalo.

NFC games possible losses are to the Cowboys and Giants.

Possible losses amongst Division winners, Steelers, and Broncos. 


I think we lose only one of our Division games (in Buffalo).

We lose to the Texans (its in Huston and they are a pretty good team overall provided their QB situation is straight at the start of the season)
I think we win vs Pittsburgh, lose vs the Broncos


and we lose our game to the Giants but beat the Cowboys.

12-4. of course this could change and we could lose games i have as wins or win games I have as loses. or have ties.

I think Kubiac does a good job of adapting. Another Coach who I think Adapts well is River Boat Ron.

He hands over all of them. All of his private conversations with family get leaked guaranteed.

Turns some of them over. ""This is only the stuff he wants us to see ergo he's guilty"" even if he does hand over anything relevant to the investigation.

readonlypdf,well except for injure people. We will annihilate the Colts though.

readonlypdf,Hey Eagles your game is after the suspension. Bend over
readonlypdf,"Well a Drop Kicked Field goal IMO depending on range can be a better option than a place kick.

Since you don't need a holder you can set up in such a way that you can run a fake drop kick which could be more successful than a fake field goal if you QB can kick. So it might be something coaches might invest some time in simply because it is another weapon."
readonlypdf,"if we are talking execution, then probably Denver or Cincinatti or Either Indy Game or Chicago. If Significance is what you are looking for. well unless you didn't know Super Bowl."

They only had 2 shut outs and the most points they allowed was 23. I assume it worked partially because the Idea of sending that many players into the Backfield as often as they did (it wasn't every down, but it was pretty often) was unexpected, but the fact it worked throughout the season and not just the first few weeks is testament to its soundness as an idea. That said, it was a one year thing and the defense fell back down to earth in 78. "

The punishment is Way excessive.

4 games is the same as Ben Rapelessberger's preappeal suspension and TWICE Ray Rices Pre-media blow up suspension.

The Fine is the same fine that the Saints were handed for PURPOSEFULLY Attempting to Injure players. The Draft Picks are just.... words can't describe that.

Did Brady Deserve Punishment, yes, You won't get argument there from me. But The next time someone tampers with game balls I want a similar level of punishment handed out. 

If I were commissioner I would have fined Brady 275,000 and said I'll double it if it happens again. the 275k comes from x*25,000 where 25,000 is the fine for equipment violations, and x is the number of instances which I'll go with the widely reported number of 11.

completely fair has grounding in the rule book and no undue interference from the media. I also would have done it quickly so the media would shut up about it and not call into question the league's control of the situation."

readonlypdf,The Love Boat part 2 electric bugaloo redux
readonlypdf,GnR good way to start a day.
readonlypdf,"&gt; Brady suspended full season, appeals to ten games, returns to face The Broncos.
&gt; BB suspended indefinitely with chance to apply for reinstatement after SB 50.
&gt; Max fine.
&gt; Loss of Draft Picks.

Ok lets address your guesses one by one shall we

1. That would really make people hate the NFL (well except teams in the AFC East they would love it). and it would be like saying hey Brady we know you didn't hurt anyone, but we're gonna give you the same penalty as if you did, except unlike that one person we won't mention we'll let you appeal it down to about the equivalent of a 2nd time weed offense. So no you are going way too far there. hell any suspension is too far because its like saying he is taking PED's or smoking dope. A fine is more than sufficiant and is the penalty described in the rule book (25 k for each instance would more than suffice, trust me it adds up real quick)

2. The report pretty much says BB was not involved. so yeah glad you live in Colorado where the cause of you reaching this conclusion is legal.

3. A decent fine would work but not a max fine like something serious like cheating the IR system (which many teams have done) would net you.

4. in addition to number 3 if you go with a lighter fine you might be able to get away with taking a 4th rounder or even a 3rd rounder."

needs to bulk and strengthen up, but he's versatile and good in coverage. a bit raw in technique, but that's coachable. 

should make the panthers the best LB corp if he turns out well.

"
sunstersun,"&gt; These guys are the real casualties in all this. Brady and Kraft will survive financially. I wish they got suspended with pay at least.

maybe that's why they insisted on having a legit reason for a 5th interview. "
sunstersun,"&gt; I asked why wouldn't Brady turn over his phone if he didn't have anything to hide. 

Because you shouldn't have to turn over your private phone? The NFLPA called Brady and told him not to? Any communication between mcnally, the manager and brady would be on their company phones?


"
sunstersun,"I think it would just be funny to watch the NFL squirm over it.

although i'd think that small town markets would get shafted.

"

He allowed 0 TD's and had a 47.8 pass rating when thrown to. Revis allowed two TD's and had a 72.6 passer rating when thrown to. 

Revis allowed 557 yards on 79 throw attempts, while

CHJ allowed 356 yards on 89 throw attempts.

CHJ had 3 ints while Revis had two.

CHJ YPC is 7.7, while Revis's was 13.6

this is probably inflated by Revis's relatively bad start to the season, but that is included.



is there anything else you would like to know?

sunstersun,"well, if you could find it. i'd be interested in looking at it.
"
sunstersun,"accuracy - brees

mental - brady

arm strength - stafford

legs- vick

body - luck or newton

footwork - rodgers

touch - manning"
sunstersun,"karma then?
"
sunstersun,It's a reference to Ray rice video 
sunstersun,"I seriously don't see what's wrong with chips moves.

Demarco Murray is basically a push for McCoy 

Kiko for free basically 

Fletcher for maxwell 

Losing maclin does suck, but algohor is a replacement. 

And finally Sam for foles is a wash since foles played like 7 games "
sunstersun,"cool, always good to know you can reason with people on reddit.

I think some teams would give a 2nd for cobb though since the packers would absorb the signing bonus.
"
sunstersun,"the sterotypical reason is wisconsin running backs bust.
"
sunstersun,"dude, the report cleared him.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; because of the history the pats have and him lying and tryin to cover up

this is what you made it out to be.

i stated before this case, there wasn't an incident at all of covering up / lying.

"
sunstersun,"If i were the colts, I'd take brown just to deny him to the patriots if all else.
"
sunstersun,"I dunno, i just think the league is suspect to media and fan pressure when determining punishments that aren't written down strictly.
"
sunstersun,"Tre Jackson, Jay Ajayi, Clemmings and anyone not mocked in the 6th round.
"
sunstersun,I can assure you goodell will not be the judge in a federal court case
sunstersun,"pls tom.
"
sunstersun,"tell him andy dalton is a pro bowler.
"
sunstersun,I doubt Albert since his injury. He only played like 8 games
sunstersun,"well yes, because the points would be based on stats.
"
sunstersun,"well, why would you not want more money?
"
sunstersun,"Yanda is insane.
"
sunstersun,"2013 - 2014 my bad.

it's not fair to compare the lions and seahawks since the lions pass more.
"
sunstersun,"4th quarter tim tebow has a better QBR than tom brady - skip
"
sunstersun,"because there is legal consideration right now ?

"
sunstersun,"they replace mccoy with murray, and replaced maclin with algholor and upgrade their defense with kiko and  maxwell.
"
sunstersun,"so? inflated passing stats are a thing ya know? 

also doesn't take into consideration the amount of sacks he takes in comparison.
"
sunstersun,"the only thing i can say about kap last season is he took a lot of sacks. still he had a pretty good year against everyone but the seahawks.

"
sunstersun,"wes welker for the newer patriot fans.

people act like he was some scrub and edelmans better.

"
sunstersun,"well no i'm saying you didn't read that i admitted and fessed up.
"
sunstersun,how did you know T_T
sunstersun,"Dude it's one downvote, you bring up a good point "
sunstersun,"rip packer fans.
"
sunstersun,"he might be a decent fullback.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; I just think Luck deserves a ring.

really?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Damn you guys sound deflated already

"
sunstersun,"this isn't a media conference.
"
sunstersun,"I'm guessing you just aren't used to the rich style of decorating.

Like, these guys stare at this shit every day, and we stare at normal houses, what seems abnormal for us, is normal for them.
 "
sunstersun,"Bryan Stork.

He did amazing for a rookie, but in the grand scheme of things he was slightly below average.
"
sunstersun,"besides not turning over his cell phone, which he was fully allowed to, and potentially lying to the press(which isn't relevant to the investigation) 

what did he do?
"
sunstersun,"none of the phone records would be released to the public.
"
sunstersun,"because the intent isn't to cheat, it's to abuse a stupid rule, there is a difference.
"
sunstersun,"I wish we drafted Cann at 2.32
"
sunstersun,"if he wins another superbowl is the important part you left out.
"
sunstersun,"yup, no arguments from me.

Joe Thomas top 3 LT and Haden's still underrated as a corner for some reason.
"
sunstersun,"you're right.

tim duncan is probably the most uninspiring player ever. 

just solid fundamentals.

"
sunstersun,"well our perception is also skewed by dining with people that don't decorate the same exact way either.
"
sunstersun,"shut up
"
sunstersun,"it was total horseshit how screwed over the panthers were from the handling of hardy's case.
"
sunstersun,"mobile qbs, good defenses, terrible receivers, bad o-lines.
"
sunstersun,"while all the previous superbowl mvp's montana manning honor him.
"
sunstersun,"his name has been cleared and the new cba has a cap for UDFA

basically he will go to whatever team he wants, money is not a factor.
"
sunstersun,panthers 
sunstersun,"td/int % is where it's at baby.
"
sunstersun,"uh, i don't think charles woodson is a top 5 fs anymore despite him being awesome for his age.
"
sunstersun,"I'm just gonna go ahead and say brady something asked for the balls to be deflated.

but deflated doesn't mean under the legal limit.
"
sunstersun,"ben had one of his best stat career.

"
sunstersun,"panthers seahawks.
"
sunstersun,\m/
sunstersun,"&gt; Better at rushing the ball

wrong.

Peyton has had five 1000  yard rushers while Brady has had two.

also one season where the previous season had maybe on of the best teams in nfl history going 11-5 is a huge drop off. especially considering the strength of schedule.

"
sunstersun,"too bad their defenses are that great.
"
sunstersun,"he tried to suspend the players, but once it got to court they were overturned instantly, the investigation was pretty badly done, a lot of people though payton getting suspended was too much."
sunstersun,"the worst argument you could possibly choose.


when we're talking about offensive stats, peyton manning has thrown to two HOF receivers for the majority of his career.
"
sunstersun,"oh yeah, that was bad.

slugfest of a game.

both defenses went ham as fuck.


"
sunstersun,"SD 3-13 seems insane.
"
sunstersun,"his main problem is the DUI's.

everyone seems to skip over these like they are nothing.

"
sunstersun,"we'll see since brady's lawyer kept a copy of the requested scope and he said he would release it.
"
sunstersun,"after welker dropped the ball.
"
sunstersun,"what the fuck is this friendly fire.
"
sunstersun,"it was a joke.
"
sunstersun,"shane vereen draw play.

"
sunstersun,"there's a lot better words to describe what he's trying to say.

""victim complex."" persecution complex. using martyr complex is misleading. 

&gt; a person who is killed because of their religious or other beliefs

is the google definition of martyr.





"
sunstersun,"so? we had like 10 corners.

granted none of them were revis, but the point is the cuts were expected.
"
sunstersun,C+ 
sunstersun,"wtf i can't see the comments
"
sunstersun,"the question is basically will rodgers be better than manning and will luck be better than farve.

"
sunstersun,"CAUSE WE'RE THE....



\o"
sunstersun,"Moss, Moss, and Randy Moss.
"
sunstersun,"right, now go and find me a piece of evidence to suggest that the ball boy deflated the balls after the refs performed their inspection.

or find evidence brady asked the balls to be deflated below 12.5
"
sunstersun,"PED's?

"
sunstersun,"that means Eli wins over Peyton.
"
sunstersun,"well recency bias = http://www.gfycat.com/DarlingIncredibleAllosaurus

not recency bias = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eawwO1moIIE"
sunstersun,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONdLEqzhXOI
sunstersun,"maybe but i wouldn't say cassel is better than orton like the other guy said.
"
sunstersun,"no, disprove the source i posted, not repost some other source.
"
sunstersun,"Can he play corner?
"
sunstersun,"carolina vs patriots 2013 season was pretty infuriating.
"
sunstersun,"No he didn't say that, he said he didn't know any of the ball boys, Jastremski is the general manager of equipment.

"
sunstersun,"Uh, Patriot fans prefer to not acknowledge Eli at all.

Like I get a twisted joy when i see him fail, then I get all sad again when I realize ""how the fuck did we lose to this guy who threw almost 30 ints in a season.""

"
sunstersun,"hyped for the movie!
"
sunstersun,"so that means brady bought him new shoes? news flash it doesn't, i'm sure people joke about this stuff all the time.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; What do emotions have to do with this?

perhaps some of the texts like outlined in the report could be jokes?
"
sunstersun,"which makes perfect sense since the ref testified the patriot balls were all 12.5 and the colts balls were around 13
"
sunstersun,"same with calvin, he's still a great route runner, but compared to  jordy, brown, and ty, he's not as good.
"
sunstersun,"lol, we aren't talking about the HOF.

also it's a bit early to say who's better between watkins and odell.
"
sunstersun,"duh, black widow is such a heroic, strong and useful character.
"
sunstersun,"yeah i guess, but can we beat the giants this time?

3rd times the charm right?
"
sunstersun,"I mean, i should have clarified. There are some other factors.

did amazing for a 4th round pick who missed training camp due to injuries.
"
sunstersun,"i hope people realize how inflated passing stats are through the different generations.

"
sunstersun,"nice pick, protect the QB!
"
sunstersun,"la'el collins.
"
sunstersun,"every one thinks they have a fantastic draft lol.

that being said, i think the lions go 10-6.
"
sunstersun,"well, anything can be taken out of context and made to look bad.

wouldn't you want to talk to the equipment guy after you were accused of tampering with the footballs?

"
sunstersun,"I'd rather have brandon lafell who we signed for 3 million from free agency than cobb who i would suffer a 10 mil cap hit and have to give up a 2nd.

"
sunstersun,"superbowl hangover because they cut a bad corner?
"
sunstersun,"well they actually did the same thing the patriots did.
"
sunstersun,"everyone improves with their first rounder.

by not improving you got worse.
"
sunstersun,If this was a court case it would be tossed out since we can't use the refs testimony on the psi levels since he didn't record them 
sunstersun,"never change Rex.

"
sunstersun,"slightly less than a franchise QB, slightly more than a non-franchise QB.
"
sunstersun,"Not a movie, but blue mountain state is fucking hilarious.

Movie: remember the titans or invincible.
"
sunstersun,"never plays out because the FO always folds.
"
sunstersun,"no.

if nothing happened for bounty gate or the broncos cap violations then no.
"
sunstersun,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU TRAITOR.


"
sunstersun,"No, injuries are bad for the NFL's profits. if they could do something they would.
"
sunstersun,"anyone with a brain could tell kuechly was gonna be good, the only knock were his stats in college were inflated. he was technically sound who had a beast of a pro day. people were concerned with his pass rushing ability as well, i don't think he's that good of a pass rusher though.

hightower i was too biased to cover since he went to the pats. but i thought he was physically unsuited for a linebacker, he struggled hardcore in the first 2 years.


wagner i didn't expect him to turn out this good the 2nd best MLB. i really missed the mark with him. i thought he was mostly undersized.



borland i thought he would be bad, i didn't pay that much attention to him since he was 3rd round/4th round prospect.


"
sunstersun,"Okay then since it's more probable than not right you won't mind answering some questions about the report since I'm probably massive homer bias.

""Is there evidence of tom brady ordering the balls to be deflated lower than 12.5?""

""Is there evidence that brady ordered the balls to be deflated after the ref inspection.""

the only two rule violations are listed above, can you prove that brady violated them?
"
sunstersun,"taylor swift or emma watson.
"
sunstersun,"no one is the GOAT. too subjective and rules/era is constantly changing.
"
sunstersun,"why the delay? 

"
sunstersun,"umm.... andre johnson had the numbers of reggie wayne, do you think he was a top 100 player last year?
"
sunstersun,"how about the text, ""now deflate and get rid of that jacket."" 

or something like that.

doesn't that sound like lose some weight and lose the jacket?

"
sunstersun,"bail him out of 4 turnovers, not that many defenses.
"
sunstersun,Stork was VERY good for a rookie.
sunstersun,"Baldwin is not garbage lol.

he had the same stats as golden tate 2013-2014 season when they were both on the seahawks.

"
sunstersun,"what's the idea with people discrediting QB's with the term ""System.""

"
sunstersun,"patriots pick QB's based on handsomeness not based on skill.

"
sunstersun,"Sorry man. at least ya'll got vic beasley who was my top pass rusher this class.

"
sunstersun,"i have a bigger beef with the officiating that game.
"
sunstersun,"you're off by a bit.

i don't think stork or nink would approach top 10, we have hightower, and collins who were beast linebackers last year, Vollmer who was a top 5 RT,"
sunstersun,"Okay, lets go through it. 

where did he not cooperate besides refusing to hand over his phone, which the NFLPA called him and told him not to do.
"
sunstersun,"9 mil is still 9 mil, it might mean different to you or me compared to reed, but 9 mil is still a lot of money, and it would be perfectly reasonable to want to collect 9 mil.
"
sunstersun,WTF????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
sunstersun,"i'm a raptors fan so what?

YOU GOT NOTHING ON US.

WE'RE THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME DIFFERENTLY.

even though we got swept :/

"
sunstersun,"paying off and reaching a settlement are different.

even innocent people settle all the time to avoid long court trials.

"
sunstersun,"watch him for the broncos in the 4th quarter.

literally shut sanders down 3 straight plays.
"
sunstersun,"nfc is so stacked man.

cards (healthy palmer), cowboys, packers, and seahawks are gonna be titans next year.
"
sunstersun,no
sunstersun,Giants because coughlin won't be in the hot seat!
sunstersun,"here's the real value of draft picks versus proven players.

cheap ass rookie contracts.
"
sunstersun,"fuck it, we'll take him.

might as well run up the score.
"
sunstersun,"why is no cornerbacks being brought up ?

also good, fuck hernandez.
"
sunstersun,"alright shut up, this is a stupid conversation i don't know why i bothered with a troll.

"
sunstersun,"Wouldn't people just take the 15 yards to take out a receiver near the end of game ? since concussion tests take more than one play.

"
sunstersun,http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2464426-insider-buzz-goodell-gaining-owners-support-from-strong-deflategate-punishment
sunstersun,"yeah! i expected trent richardson here.
"
sunstersun,"it's illegal to tamper with balls after ref inspection so yes.

heating balls would raise the psi also and make the ball less cold to catch.

"
sunstersun,WTFFFFFFFFFFF
sunstersun,"you shouldn't, joe thomas and jason peters are better than him right now.

long term because of age yes.
"
sunstersun,"please no.
"
sunstersun,"What the fuck? No.

He should go out and get angry.
"
sunstersun,"hey man, bill's innocent in this. call brady a cheater for this if you must, but he had nothing to do with this.
"
sunstersun,do the broncos have a historically top 3 defense ?
sunstersun,he's not below average are you crazy?
sunstersun,"you mean before the rule change that allowed teams to prepare their own footballs?
"
sunstersun,"prophecy
"
sunstersun,"what did you see? was there some information or something?
"
sunstersun,"funny enough the colts besides davis don't have a lock top 5 player.
"
sunstersun,"well, I do have consideration for loyalty, I just don't consider it when it comes to deserving a ring.

but the point is i don't really buy the bad team = deserve ring argument.
"
sunstersun,"it's not anxiety issues.

what do you call skipping 3 meetings?
"
sunstersun,"Sigh, the sad truth.

I wish he would have just came out and accepted it, it would look better than flip flopping.
"
sunstersun,"you need a life.
"
sunstersun,"well I was highly entertained with the colts and bengals first round choices.
"
sunstersun,"don't post shit from manish mehta.

even jet fans can't stand him.
"
sunstersun,"nah you don't mean that.
"
sunstersun,Not all cheating scandals are the same. The saints punishment is the baseline for bounties 
sunstersun,"we haven't seen what wilson can do with a legit weapon like graham.
"
sunstersun,"just play for the patriots ! /s

"
sunstersun,"right, but it's the most straight forward for the eagles.

since the contract expires.
"
sunstersun,"Lotta steelers games.
"
sunstersun,"which is why we are so good at collecting gates.

"
sunstersun,"10/10 exactly who I wanted, and in fact in the mock drafts I did we wanted to trade up for this guy. 

Also, http://imgur.com/URCG6o9"
sunstersun,"O-guard.

marpet, cann or jackson.

"
sunstersun,Mack should make it but if he isn't there before the roty I doubt it 
sunstersun,"no i get it, but it really is misleading for most people.

since most people relate martyr to religion.

"
sunstersun,"no chance, and lord knows if the steelers would have 7.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; and the investigation showed a guy calling himself the fucking deflator.

let me give you a very good example of taking things out of context to make people seem bad.


Have you ever called someone a ""fucking bitch, or gay."" on a text message or in a real life conversation.

Now, if i didn't understand the context of the situation. aka a joking situation I'd assume you'd be a homophobic.
"
sunstersun,"well they did interview all the previous ref crews, and it was the first time that the balls were taken out of the ref's sight.
"
sunstersun,"bears would take hightower.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; because that's a phrase

No it's a statement.

"
sunstersun,"palmer injury, age 35 isn't easy to come back from acl.
"
sunstersun,"linsanity was bonkers.

something like 12 games of superstar production and outplaying kobe  with 38.
"
sunstersun,"they interviewed the ref squad of every game for the past 3 years or something and this was the only night they broke protocol when it comes to entering the bathroom. i just wanted to go along with it to disprove the fumbling theory.
"
sunstersun,"biggest difference is the dmac signing and that would be HUGE.

honestly it would be an A+ off season if they could have gotten dmac, maxwell, and re-signed maclin but i think they would need to spend 11 mil on the safety.

the best season in my mind if they would be fine with foles would be murray, maxwell, dmac and re-sign maclin(if not draft algholor) 


"
sunstersun,"&gt; It's a win-win.

except we lost our first.

"
sunstersun,"For the 500th, time this is a joke site.
"
sunstersun,"fuck you in the butt.
"
sunstersun,"don't act like this is unique to patriot fans.

i remember 3 weeks before the mccoy trade, an eagles guy brought up trading mccoy and signing murray and eagle fans shot it down hard.
"
sunstersun,"i mean i guess that would be true, but i'd think the ideal time to release it to take the pressure off(joke intended) would be last friday.
"
sunstersun,No
sunstersun,"&gt; Peyton Manning has more 4th quarter comebacks than any QB in history, and by a huge margin.

that's a useless stat if i've ever seen one, % of 4th quarter comebacks is way more important.

"
sunstersun,"eh, he's got a pretty good rep for playing against manning.
"
sunstersun,"Steelers vs Cards might be the best superbowl ever.
"
sunstersun,"i mean i would have liked it to be conclusive....
"
sunstersun,"that doesn't mean he gets in, his counterpart Marvin Harrison hasn't gotten in and he's got a better chance then Wayne does.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; The intentional circumvention of the rules

I have asked every single person who brings this up to answer the following questions.

1) Where in the report does it say Brady asked the ball boy to deflate the balls below 12.5

2) Where in the report does it say Brady wants the balls to be readjusted after the ref checking.
"
sunstersun,"yeah that was a misleading contract restructure.
"
sunstersun,"can you relax about the patriots for a second, i wasn't even talking about the patriots. i was talking about the principle when it comes to hiding stuff.

"
sunstersun,"pls.

we need you lael, and we've dealt with murderers before! /s

"
sunstersun,"okay that makes more sense.
"
sunstersun,"is nick foles the goat because he had 27-2 season?

"
sunstersun,"wait why is this guy deciding the punishment?
"
sunstersun,moss
sunstersun,"giants, because giants.
"
sunstersun,"gotta say the bills fell a notch this draft.

jets had the best overall i think and dolphins had a pretty good draft too.
"
sunstersun,"Gronk, Brady, Dmac, Vollmer, Hightower, Slater, Collins, and Ghost.


"
sunstersun,"with that much money, anyone is a hooker. 

who do you buy ?
"
sunstersun,"I'd be very conflicted.
"
sunstersun,"i think we should just roll with fate and let garappolo face the giants.
"
sunstersun,"Yeah better stats because he has more weapons and the team is built around him.

"
sunstersun,"well, i wouldn't say it was the best show of all time, but i enjoy it alot.
"
sunstersun,"No one doesn't think the tuck rule is fucking wack as fuck, we go with it because it's the reason we won.
"
sunstersun,http://lolpats.tumblr.com/image/100083208139
sunstersun,"poor speed?

"
sunstersun,"Cooper/Fowler.
"
sunstersun,"i think you overestimate how much defence the patriots are going to be doing here.

since tom brady is suing the NFL, they have to prove is the NFL violated the cba.
"
sunstersun,"i think he has to have at least 100 passes.

"
sunstersun,"I love when people bring up the history of cheating point.

One incident of cheating =/= history.

if we go by that, then the steelers, broncos, 49ers, cowboys, redskins saints, falcons, and browns have a history of cheating. 

it's absurd to call it history one there is one instance of being punished for violating the rules.



"
sunstersun,"i know, but it really does screw the player.

career ending injuries occur all the time, and the rookie wage + franchise tag is basically 5 years of no real long term financial commitment to a player if he's not drafted in 1st round.
"
sunstersun,Aaron Donald twice ?
sunstersun,"i hope he just retires a colt though, sign a one day contract.

it sucks watching him get hurt.
"
sunstersun,"Not your personal phone nope.
"
sunstersun,"This isn't a press conference.
"
sunstersun,"what are you trying to say here?

"
sunstersun,"it's not the bad season, he's just an easy person to hate.
 

he's had a better season than Cam, yet no one gives him flack.
"
sunstersun,"bruh, we gave you hoyer, mallet, wilfork, BOB, and this is how you repay us?

"
sunstersun,"there is no history on the patriots organization of lying and trying to cover up scandals outside of this incident.

&gt;  because of the history the pats have and him lying and tryin to cover up

you can't mix cheating and covering up now. originally you stated they would get punished for the history of covering shit up, i ask you where in history have they covered shit up, then you reply with they ""cheated."" which isn't your original point.




"
sunstersun,"why does he do this every time, make some random 7th/udfa DB pick in the 2nd.
"
sunstersun,Ray Lewis as the 3rd best of all time?
sunstersun,"right, but i'm asking is why the weather explanation doesn't fit in the wells report.

a starting pressure of 12.5 psi, a starting
temperature of between 67 and 71 degrees and a final temperature of 48 degrees), the Ideal Gas
Law predicts that the Patriots balls should have measured between 11.52 and 11.32 psi at the end
of the first half, just before they were brought back into the Officials Locker Room. 

both of these experiments conclude it's very plausible the ideal gas law caused the deflation in the footballs by half time.

especially the khan explanation.

those are numbers that strictly contradict well's findings.

also if you note the differences between the drops of temperature between the two measurements across the board, it is mostly consistent with a drop of 0.3-0.5 psi.

thus if you go with the undropped PSI, the patriots only had 3 balls underinflated what the gas laws state would be fine.


"
sunstersun,"is there anywhere in the report that supports the balls were deflated after the ref check?

"
sunstersun,"not what i meant, they cleary low ball the shit out of him.

the cap hit for a 22mil/year deal would be the same as the franchise tag, then next year you have to sign him again.
"
sunstersun,"i don't know why we're talking about this lol.

he might get suspended, i seriously doubt a full season.

"
sunstersun,"which is fucking retarded since the NFLPA called him and told him not to do so.
"
sunstersun,"no one has any questions about the colts passing offence, what people consistently cite is the lack of a defense for the past 10 years. 

they've given manning and luck very very good weapons on the offensive side of the ball which give great passing stats, but aren't great in the playoffs.

that being said, the only reason i could see this selection is if they don't want to pay TY hilton next year.
"
sunstersun,"so where's that article that links the patriots covered it up ?

"
sunstersun,"salary cap is a bitch.
"
sunstersun,"If they won it all sure, rivers deserves a ring "
sunstersun,"only 3 of the balls were outside of the atmospheric conditions and since we didn't get a decent comparison to the colts balls ( only 4 balls were tested for some odd reason) there could be a whole bunch of reasons why those balls were under.


"
sunstersun,"He's got so many problems in staying healthy, his ankles have been bothering him for a while, while a cliche everything depends on his health, I'd say megatron is past his prime, but that doesn't mean he still can't be a fucking great receiver.
"
sunstersun,"t.j clemmings and lalel collins.
"
sunstersun,"Texans and Browns.
"
sunstersun,Choke 100%
sunstersun,"I mean I won't call Sanchez a full on bust, but he was serviceable this year in philly, although it could just be chips system.

"
sunstersun,"in all fairness, QB passer rating doesn't take into sacks, running stats and receiver mistakes.

"
sunstersun,"they don't it's just a joke.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; I think the difference is they confessed when they were caught.

yeah bullshit, they got fined for trying to cover it up.


http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000091683/article/san-diego-chargers-fined-20k-by-nfl-in-towel-case"
sunstersun,"&gt; He owes the organization so much

wut?


"
sunstersun,"a shitty QB?

gtfo.
"
sunstersun,"yes he's free to choose whatever team he wants.
"
sunstersun,"oh yeah, i think it's important to add context to stats. 

for example wilson has only 3000 some passing yards, but he has 11 rushing tds and 700 rushing yards.

that doesn't show up on passer rating.
"
sunstersun,"yeah, i think he busts as hard as ryan leaf.
"
sunstersun,"how do you interpret that from me asking what the point of playing psychologist was?

"

"
sunstersun,"probably because the pats don't know the entire story at the start either, and it's just simpler to suspend them.

it's not like it really matters since they aren't doing any work in the offseason anyways."
sunstersun,"I'm gonna put the table back up.

┬─┬ノ(ಠ益ಠノ)
"
sunstersun,"because we got punished a 1st on not cooperating i guess.
"
sunstersun,"because lower round draft picks can turn into gold versus the nba has 2 rounds with any pick outside the top 10 is purely luck based.
"
sunstersun,"bucs have some under appreciated defensive pieces.

"
sunstersun,"Yes, and I called dibs.

But realistically probably a contender and the saints have a shot.
"
sunstersun,"did you read the OP?
"
sunstersun,"pls i'll take the fine, the suspension the draft pick punishment if goodell is gone.
"
sunstersun,"you are some next level of dumb homer.

"
sunstersun,"giants meet the ravens.

who's da more elite post season QB.

other wise I'd be happy with eli vs peyton with eli winning.

"
sunstersun,"do you like the patriots?
"
sunstersun,"no problem, i think it's probably a good idea to get the fanbase's interpretation for a 6-10.

cause the top 5 players for really good/well known teams are general knowledge.

like packers, clay, rodgers, cobb, jordy, sitton.
"

this has nothing to do with marrone though.

he can't hit an open receiver.
"
sunstersun,"nobody wants the overrated QB.

/s"
sunstersun,"yes openly admitting it probably helped, but I stick to my guns when I say the main reason the falcons got off so light were the lack of public outrage.
"
sunstersun,"they are 1a and 1b, i'd give the nod to jason peters by a hair, but both are basically equal.
"
sunstersun,"I mean if you out extra weight into that post season game, but looking at the season as a whole he was placed correctly IMO "
sunstersun,"that's fine, because in the courts they couldn't prove more than 50% that brady ordered the balls to be deflated below 12.5 psi after the ref inspection

they're only argument in the wells report is no ball boy deflates a ball without his QB's knowledge.

that's it.
"
sunstersun,"what the fuck ?
"
sunstersun,"can't trust people with moustaches like that.
"
sunstersun,"&gt;  I like the idea in theory but as a fan sitting at home I don't really like it.

sunstersun,"it's fucking good for goodell, his approval rating since wacking the patriots has gone up with fans and the owners.
"
sunstersun,"not my future imaginary points!


I will say this though, it's clear it wasn't systemic from the patriots organization, which i doubted from the start.

But, Brady is more probable than not, a cheater.
"
sunstersun,"Injuries too.
"
sunstersun,"can you explain why this would be a bad idea for future cases?
"
sunstersun,"think jj watts contract for reference. i'd be interested to see if the jets would do ty for wilkerson straight up, i'd like to think the colts would have to sweeten the deal with some picks.

"

"
sunstersun,"eh....
"

"
sunstersun,"The wells report stated clearly that bill and the organization had nothing to do with it yet we got blasted with a mil fine and 2 picks including a first rounder. 

Also why doesn't the ignorance isn't an excuse apply here ? 

The falcons got off piss easy and it wasn't because they fully cooperated its because public opinion didn't give a shit.

If the patriots blasted fake noise they would be crucified."
sunstersun,"stat wise he isn't the most accurate, but there isn't a kicker that i trust more to take the tying FG.

that raiders game kick was insane.
"
sunstersun,"gotta go with champ over reed imo.

troy is 3rd for sure though.

"
sunstersun,"Eli, no questions asked.

When he's in the zone, he's incredible.

Outside of the zone, eh...
"

"
sunstersun,"fucking oiler fans.
"

I'm not rationale right now.
"

"
sunstersun,"not like the bills QB situation is any better.
"
sunstersun,"while there is a law suit, the pats lawyers would file for an injunction, which would nullify the suspension until the case got settled

the risk is the suspension holds around playoff time.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; I just don't see defensive players worth a lot of money

Ye so you gonna let wilkerson walk when he asks for 6 years/100 mil right?

"
sunstersun,"is he mariota?
"
sunstersun,"&gt;  But the report shows pretty clearly that he was giving those 2 clowns memorabilia to as payment

Are you sure the report says this. please point out the pg number. and it's pretty normal to provide memorabilla to the staff.

And as usual, no one can answer the two questions above.
"
sunstersun,We take the ball from goal to goal
sunstersun,"&gt; The Patriots will still be charged with the previously mentioned draft picks.

how about a two nights?

"
sunstersun,"cheating is cheating, fine.

prove that they cheated.


go through that 243 page document and find me evidence 

that the patriots employee without a doubt deflated the ball and that brady ordered it.

"
sunstersun,"i'm gonna guess under.
"
sunstersun,"well first, i think there is a rule against that, i'm not sure. second the player wouldn't believe you. 3rd a team would never do that, what if he turns out to be a massive bust?
"
sunstersun,"his run blocking is good, his pass blocking is bad.
"
sunstersun,"your post doesn't make sense.
"
sunstersun,Okay that's some wack 
sunstersun,"pls, if the patriots can't win, the evil must prevail.
"
sunstersun,"that's one throw, it means nothing.

brock would go under ""never seen him play more than 30 snaps, backup qb."""
sunstersun,"i dunno, i didn't mean this as a direct comparison.
"
sunstersun,"lol, this is the same logic the nsa is based on.

innocent? got nothing to hide? then you won't mind me looking.
"
sunstersun,"we mostly play nickle, so they would both be ILB's.

sunstersun,"He's supposed to, this isn't a media conference this is a university public speaking.
"
sunstersun,"I mean, I do find it annoying that you have to find conclusive evidence that the call on the field was wrong, refs make a lot of mistakes here, and sometimes if the on the field call was different, the overall call would be different.
"
sunstersun,"I'm not sure what your point is

the game between the patriots and packers was close, and the seahawks nearly lost the 2nd time.

"
sunstersun,"they win because andrew luck.

"
sunstersun,"it also shows how lax the refs are on the inspections, but yeah i get your point.


&gt; Why then the focus on Brady?

you know exactly why.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; This kid just short changed himself on $20-30M? Does that sound realistic to you he just loves Denver that much?

Yes it is? Some people probably don't care between the difference of 50 to 70 million. most people do, but there are some people who don't

&gt;I know I could have got more out in the (free-agent) market. I could have been someone else's No. 1 corner, but I decided it was best for me and my family to stay. I love it here. I love the fans. I love to come to work here. Everything about the city I love. The coaches I love. I'm just thankful to John [Elway] and the Broncos for giving me an opportunity to come in and play and show them what I've got and then blessing me with this.

"
sunstersun,"lolbrowns in every thread......
"
sunstersun,"probably, but that doesn't change my original point.
"
sunstersun,"The AFC teams during the Montana era were heavily underdogs when compared the the NFC freight trains of the 49ers,giants and cowboys.

the nfc championship was the real superbowl pretty much.
"
sunstersun,they're both black!

"
sunstersun,"ye but we wouldn't have won back to back.
"
sunstersun,"well yes, but he aien't cam newton slippery.
"
sunstersun,"You realize if goodell actually punishes brady on not handing over his cell phone, it would get appealed to nothing in 2 seconds.
"
sunstersun,"i'd be okay if he retired after winning the superbowl again.
"
sunstersun,"did you even click on the link?

"
sunstersun,"i prefer to spell it malcolm.
"
sunstersun,"well, some acl surgeries actually make the knee stronger, tommy john surgeries sometimes actually boost arm strength.
"
sunstersun,"he doesn't deserve it, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have the negotiation power to get it.
"
sunstersun,"vinateiri isn't the most accurate stat wise.
"
sunstersun,"also got points for punt returning i think.
"
sunstersun,"eh our corners are bad on outside.

at least arrington is.

"
sunstersun,"why didn't they check all the colts balls so there would be a consistent comparison point?
"
sunstersun,"seahawks got off to a slow start, didn't they beat the cards when palmer was playing?"
sunstersun,"I gave up on trying to convince people he didn't lie.
"
sunstersun,"okay, multitude offences go!

1) spygate.

what else?
"
sunstersun,"eh the fanbase would probably hate it more even if they got a decent haul since they can't get a replacement in the draft.
"
sunstersun,"alts =/= pro bowler.
"
sunstersun,"oooooh can we be the 4th reich that lasts for 1000 years?

"
sunstersun,"""what was unrealistic about the draft day movie?""

is the title of the thread i believe.
"
sunstersun,"maybe not, but i think we all know ware's gone after this season.

barely any dead money and he slowed down the 2nd half of the season.

talib getting cut would be weird imo. take a decent amount of dead money.
"
sunstersun,"yeah well they are being stupid.
"
sunstersun,Edelman did miss like 2 games so that would account for 150 yards
sunstersun,"incognito was average at best, and he's been out of the league for 2 years and he's 32.
"
sunstersun,"i mean he does raise other issues, it's just this one seems a lot more idk, out there.
"
sunstersun,"isn't part of it the injuries to the eagles o-line?
"
sunstersun,"no one really cared since kaep was winning.
"
sunstersun,"he's clearly making a joke.

sunstersun,"i'm not comparing it to the nsa.
"
sunstersun,"oh this gonna be good.
"
sunstersun,"newer fan correct?
"
sunstersun,"it's actually not close at all in my opinion.

in terms of play, absolutely, but if you look at the contracts, and age.

then you pick the jets 10/10.
"
sunstersun,"i don't know why people think the nfl can or should punish people for lying to the media. it's hilarious. not cooperating fine, but people bring up the lying since it's the only reasonable proof people have of wrongdoing.



"
sunstersun,"owners actually mostly support goodells decision to wack the patriots.
"
sunstersun,"Can a science major or someone explain what's wrong with the findings of these two experiments? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxsXFX3tDpg

I'll gild whoever first explains both of them wrong.

"
sunstersun,"how about you try stopping our run game?

15 rushing tds in 4 games.
"
sunstersun,"well his defense has nothing to do with his offensive production or qb stats.

infact he has some of the worst receivers for a top team.
"
sunstersun,"literally no way manning would go first anymore.

"
sunstersun,"&gt; Just a roster spot?

achilles injuries are no joke i guess.
"
sunstersun,"can you imagine charles with the cowboys or ravens o-line?
"
sunstersun,"i'm too confused and sad right now to reply with a comment that makes sense.
"
sunstersun,"no sorry, he isn't accurate and that's the biggest problem.

sanchez makes bone headed decisions but can still lazer it.
"
sunstersun,"the pats are, brady is not.
"
sunstersun,more money?
sunstersun,"i wouldn't be surprised one bit.

the 16mil/year is a difference of 9 million per year between what he can get.
"
sunstersun,"according to the emails, the nfl didn't provide the reason?

"
sunstersun,"Sam Bradford hasn't proved anything in the NFL, he has the potential, but he hasn't shown it while Tannehill has.

also injuries.
"
sunstersun,"it is, but why the hell would be discussing wr's that could very well not be in someone's top 10.

"
sunstersun,"if i were you guys, i'd prefer brady to geno smith
"
sunstersun,"i bet they would restructure that cap hit.
"
sunstersun,"yeah we got no fucking defense or boards lol.
"
sunstersun,Super Bowl win 
sunstersun,"uh, watt isn't worth more than like 3 other QBs I can name off the top of my head.

Flacco, Ryan, Wilson, "
sunstersun,"bobby hart.
"
sunstersun,"i meant 2013-2014 season.
"
sunstersun,"You're melodramatic as fuck. Bill and Kraft have been cleared of all wrong doing, so how the fuck could this be worse than spygate which was an organizational thing? 

also if you bothered to read the report, it said it's not surprising the psi levels were lower, the problem was how much lower.

since the ref testified that all patriot balls were 12.5 originally, the report specifically states it should lose 0.45 to 1.00 psi. so yes, the psi in the balls would be weird not to be under the limit.

did you read the report?"
sunstersun,"oh right.

yeah it was on paper really really good.

shame welker and moss weren't 100%. gronk and hernandez were still rookies.

"
sunstersun,"yup no tds.

although i think td's are overrated as stats.
 "
sunstersun,"you do realize if this was taken to civil court, it wouldn't fly at all right?

"
sunstersun,"&gt; I live in St. Louis and I'll be damned if I head down to my local bar wearing a Pats jersey unless I like having bullets in my chest cavity.

the bitterness of a superbowl loss never goes away"
sunstersun,"hopefully an rg3 resurgence.
"
sunstersun,"jets, kyle and mario williams are both getting up there in age.
"
sunstersun,http://imgur.com/gallery/c7NJRa2
sunstersun,"well, in all fairness, the 2014 class was pretty bad or heavily injured.
"
sunstersun,"honestly manning gets way too much crap, but rodgers deserved way more crap for that game. 

it's mostly masked by the bad seahawks performance and the onside kick.
"
sunstersun,"yes, have you ever made a joke calling someone gay, when he isn't gay.

&gt; They joked about receiving needles to deflate balls?

deflating balls is fine, we don't know if it was deliberately deflated below 12.5
 "
sunstersun,"no they didn't, they got two first round talents in the draft.
"
sunstersun,"what do you think about the gauges? 

how the ref testified he used guage A which explains the deflation level the patriots, but the report goes with guage B?
"
sunstersun,"unrealistic expectations are apart of being overrated, i'm not saying it's fair to luck, but the hype from his potential is part of why he's overrated to some people.

"
sunstersun,"No.

reddit is not for reading.
"
sunstersun,"if bowman can return to 75% of what he was, that's already pretty lucky.

just such a nasty injury.
"
sunstersun,"it broke salary cap rules.
"
sunstersun,"4 game suspension, with chance to be appealed down to 2 sounds right too.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; If someone gets downvoted and gets replied to by a pats fan who gets upvoted....

or that fan could be another fanbase, but please keep insisting it's the patriots circle jerk that's disagreeing with you.


"
sunstersun,No downvoting too right ?
sunstersun,"i mean probably.
"
sunstersun,"fuck ILB's right?
"
sunstersun,"well yes, but there isn't conclusive evidence that brady did anything wrong either.

"
sunstersun,"Brees &gt; Stafford &gt; Tannehill.
"
sunstersun,"eh, calvin is an underrated route runner, but i don't think he is top 5.
"
sunstersun,"i was counting 11, when i realized the FB position was extra.
"
sunstersun,"better yet, where are all the seahawk fans who said wilson is a top 5 qb.

"
sunstersun,"""I think it's very important for the integrity of the game to investigate the text messages between you and Gisele.""
"
sunstersun,"wut? farve won two superbowls?
"
sunstersun,"ah thats fair enough, never mind.
"
sunstersun,"lebron james.

"
sunstersun,"bowman is probably better than him before he got injured.
"
sunstersun,"right, so you can't answer the questions that are actually important to whether a rule violation occurred?

"
sunstersun,(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
sunstersun,"&gt; You totally did, as did we. Stop being so salty.

because video taping signals isn't illegal.
"
sunstersun,"*grabs popcorn*

might as well and enjoy the drama. it's better than talking about qb sandwiches.
"
sunstersun,"so i provide you with answers for two of your questions regarding the patriots, and your response is to speculate further?

Retractions happen all the time, and usually it's because the writer can't provide any evidence or sources, like in this case.

&gt; any sing the song that it was just that one game, which is just not true

no one is saying this, like the wikipedia link states, they were punished for violating the rules in one game, no one said spygate tapes were for one game, i'm saying they violated the rules one game.


i wish we could go back to discussing fun stuff.
"
sunstersun,"could be a middle suspension.
"
sunstersun,"not cool bro, not cool.
"
sunstersun,"well deflator comments were in the offseason of 2014.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; taping a teams practices 

Nope, never happened, read up on spygate.
"
sunstersun,"Brady Montana Manning.

"
sunstersun,"&gt; Not too mention Seattle is really only one injury away from being irrelevant.

nah... that's overstating it a bit.
"
sunstersun,"Because 90% of people didn't read the report. 

There are still people who believe that Brady knew Mcnally because he texted him before the investigation started.
"
sunstersun,"i don't think he's good or average, i think he's better than cassel.
"
sunstersun,"welcome to the cotton fields.
"
sunstersun,"need a solid ILB, who's athletic enough and capable of running a spy

"
sunstersun,"nice pick.

"
sunstersun,"right, and he's deflecting questions like he should.
"
sunstersun,"peoples thoughts on house?
"
sunstersun,"everyone says that ""I'M NOT GIVING UP A PROVEN PLAYER FOR AN UNPROVEN PLAYER! (draft pick)"" The truth is, in the limited salary cap era, you are trading a cobb who comes with a 10 mil / year price tag for a rookie who's on a dirt cheap deal. 


Best defensive player obviously varies from team to team, but cobb isn't the best offensive player on his team by any stretch, he's probably not the best offensive player on 50% of the teams.

also bengals while dalton is average or bad, is better than the free agent QB's.
"
sunstersun,"stress fracture in his foot.

"
sunstersun,"This is huge, I hope the NFL invests in this stuff.
"
sunstersun,"4th round was decent.
"
sunstersun,"Luck goes #1
"
sunstersun,"not really, we signed a brandon lafell in free agency who managed to get 900 yards after not having a single catch for the first 3 games.
"
sunstersun,"shorter deal is fine, anything under 23 mil a year is not.
"
sunstersun,"fair enough, but most GM's would take Luck for money purposes as well I think.
"
sunstersun,"Higher Bob Kraft to be the owner.
"
sunstersun,"because comebacks no matter how small are always a possibility.
"
sunstersun,http://awesomegifs.com/2012/07/12/beating-a-dead-horse/
sunstersun,"i agree, they need a good receiver for carr's development.

injury concerns with williams sealed the deal imo.
"
sunstersun,Too soon man :/
sunstersun,"Manning, than Brady.
"
sunstersun,"absolutely, what I don't understand is why the NFL didn't record the PSI of the balls in a game where the they were warned ahead of time.



"
sunstersun,"no, but people blast the patriots for suspending these guys before the report, while also blasting them for not cooperating.

gotta pick one. and stick to it.
"
sunstersun,"hey man, it's just optimism.

"
sunstersun,"idk man, have you seen how clutch the man is in playoffs? even when he loses, he makes the big shot.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Make Brady seem inordinately committed to workouts.

idiot.

"
sunstersun,"Come to play with Brady.
"
sunstersun,"not a passing league back then.
"
sunstersun,"do they really? 

/r/nba seems to hate them.
"
sunstersun,"I also don't understand why the colts balls are being used as the generally accepted deflation range when not all the balls were tested.

whatever though, punish and move on.
"
sunstersun,"no it's how you did in 2014 i think.
"
sunstersun,"i know logically 4 games of brady vs 1st round pick you should take the 1st rounder, but i just can't stand the idea of brady being suspended.
"
sunstersun,"well edelman is a huge contributor on special teams too, i'd probably rank cobb and sanders ahead tho.
"
sunstersun,"meet you guys there?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; We often don't arrive for kickoff

but it's still pretty loud.
"
sunstersun,"oh yeah, he totally won the ray rice case and the bountygate case.




"
sunstersun,"shit i meant all 16 games.
"
sunstersun,"Prime Colts - prime gore and johnson, mathis and cole (no wayne though)

Cards would be pretty good with prime palmer and fitz.

"
sunstersun,"lol the afc east front 7.


but regarding o-line it would be vollmer, mangold and albert, guards all suck.


"
sunstersun,"&gt; Honoring servicemen is a method of recruiting?

Sadly yes.

&gt; And doing it at an NFL game? 

Lotta males watch football. 

&gt; In a way that costs millions of dollars? 

well yes, advertising isn't cheap and running a commercial would probably be more expensive. 
"
sunstersun,"have you seen him when he was 12?
"
sunstersun,"Harris, Roby, and Talib.
"
sunstersun,New Jersey Jets 
sunstersun,"yeah because the league will take away trophies for 0.4 psi in 3 balls but not take away trophies for cap violations over 26 million dollars.
"
sunstersun,ya'll would get smacked around by the seahawks and 49ers
sunstersun,"yeah so the nfl added new rules to the bylaws.
"
sunstersun,"lol we're fucked.
"
sunstersun,"i'm so out of it right now lmao.
"
sunstersun,"i think you underestimate the 49ers.

that defense was just as good.

you also still had the patriots to beat.
"
sunstersun,"wouldn't it be hilarious if garrappolo turns out to be a hof QB?

THE THOUSAND YEAR REICH.
"
sunstersun,"this is a bad soap opera at this point.
"
sunstersun,"Jerry's World is a hilarious nickname.
"
sunstersun,Not if we cloned brady and bill 
sunstersun,"just google this shit man
"
sunstersun,"shit was added because the video popped.
"
sunstersun,"troll account.
"
sunstersun,"Spygate is different since the patriots organization came out and said they did something wrong.

&gt; Also remember had this played out in the courts, Brady would've had to turn over all relevant text messages and would've been subject to a deposition under duress of perjury.

if this was actual case, the evidence would be dismissed instantly based on not having the psi readings at the time of the referee checks. 
"
sunstersun,"In some legal cases, what Wells did was malpractice.
"
sunstersun,"where did he lie in the investigation?
"
sunstersun,"well Ronnie Lott, one of the best safeties ever, consensus top 3 has said that Reed is better than him.

Polamalu in comparison to reed isn't as good.
"
sunstersun,"ej manuel eh....
"
sunstersun,"It's a light hearted joke man.
"
sunstersun,"well I know the giants won, i'm just asking why it's so funny.
"
sunstersun,"neither of those players will be head coaches i think.
"
sunstersun,"how could we possibly be the worst draft when we had one of the best steals in the 1st round and great picks in the 4th?
"
sunstersun,"i wouldn't mind one bit honestly.
"
sunstersun,"100% broncos vs ravens 42 seconds 2 timeouts, one of the goat qb's and you take a knee?
"
sunstersun,"as in you made shit up.

"
sunstersun,this isn't really performance enhancing though. 
sunstersun,"Do you know how serious his injury is? He might not be able to play the game actually, his knee is injured to the point that any more injuries will end his to play the game for sure. Do you know how many players go through some sort of knee injury? Beyond that he hasn't played a snap.

He's not a steal until he can play a game.
"
sunstersun,"i mean it's a subjective opinion.
"
sunstersun,"I mean, I think most people have a general idea of the top 5 players of most teams, but what about 6-10?

"
sunstersun,"how about the ref saying he used one gauge that explains the deflation level of the patriots, but the wells report concluding that the ref switched gauges contrary to the ref's testimony?

"
sunstersun,"i totally agree that this would be dumb, but it's not the organization giving him the money.


"
sunstersun,"yes his agent should not go into conspiracy theories when trying to defend tom brady.

"
sunstersun,"Just move on until the punishment is decided.

"
sunstersun,"That's perfectly subjective and considering some people put him in the top 10, it's not EGREGIOUSLY HOMER to put him the top 5.
"
sunstersun,"lol, the patriots haven't lost a fumble at home in the past 25 years, they don't control the balls being transported to the stadium in away games.

sunstersun,"Wilson could force 25 mil/year and the seahawks couldn't do shit about it.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Not as satisfied if this means we get rid of Wilkerson.. in that case, Kevin White would have been a better pick.

You save yourself a 6 year/100 mil deal with this route.

"
sunstersun,"well they did break the rules.

i know they didn't sign any players they wouldn't, but didn't they delay like 26 million dollars in payment? not under the table money, they just went overboard in the backlog payments.

"

"
sunstersun,Solder is not overrated because of one down year. 
sunstersun,"he might have been had he went 19-0, but he's always a viking honestly.
"
sunstersun,"i wouldn't give a first pick for cobb no way.

best defensive player? are you crazy? 

bengals would be stupid to trade dalton for cobb.


"
sunstersun,"this is a speculative article.
"
sunstersun,"""none of his teamates went to his birthday party!""

could they not use realistic stuff like rape allegations or getting free stuff?
"
sunstersun,gates?
sunstersun,"probably should just give him 14-0.
"
sunstersun,"eh. he clearly violates the terms they agreed on based on negligence. 

i just read somewhere that it could be considered malpractice.
"
sunstersun,"nice looks good. just gotta not default to the old position under the stress of a game.
"
sunstersun,"i'll fucking have a heart attack if we don't draft tre jackson.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; No one's trading him

"
sunstersun,"they are better than the south and give better competition to the patriots for sure.
"
sunstersun,"it's random who's thread gets selected, i remember the threads for the draft.
"
sunstersun,"be dropped the ball near FG range.
"
sunstersun,"he's talkin about spygate and he isn't wrong.
"
sunstersun,"I have to say, the browns did amazing this draft.

Cam Erving can play anywhere and Shelton is the best NT in the draft.

"
sunstersun,"isn't it his job to deflate/inflate balls?

"
sunstersun,"eh, JPP shouldn't be there imo.
"
sunstersun,"Innocent people get suspended during investigations all the time.

In a malpractice suit that you very well might win, hospitals suspend their doctors all the time. Teachers during sexual harassment allegations aren't allowed to continue to teach while there is a trial going on."
sunstersun,"If i got a 21 year old charles woodson, i'd die happy.
"
sunstersun,"I'm just saying when everyone cites a good draft or improving team, i like to bring up that every team improves as well.

also the QB situation for the Browns is probably worse than last year, i don't expect the writer to be right, but I can see the rationale.
"
sunstersun,"he's only had 1 healthish season.

it's hard for me to just assume bradford is way better when foles actually did a lot better. now granted this is probably 70% due to the team's differences.
"
sunstersun,"which doesn't matter since smoking weed is illegal and is tested for in the NFL.
"
sunstersun,"probably had more to do with the cap.

"
sunstersun,"yeah, his injuries were just misfortunate though. i wouldn't blame it on the rams o-line specifically.
"
sunstersun,"is it really? 

what does the texts prove? please keep in mind half of the texts are in joking context like the report outlined.
"
sunstersun,"yeah winning changes everything even if it's a dumb decision.

like the saints onside kick would be considered fucking retarded if they recovered and lost by a possession.
"
sunstersun,"it's kinda sad and funny this isn't a joke.
"
sunstersun,"dat route running tho.
"
sunstersun,"not totally fair since the injury.

we missed out on the prime of brady's career and he spent the next year trying to recover from the knee injury.
"
sunstersun,"have they ever met in the playoffs?

because that's when Eli is on his best game.
"
sunstersun,"running backs are the most variance in all time lists.

really hard to compare.

"
sunstersun,"we all know the packers don't sign free agents, draft for life.

"
sunstersun,"lol would they really give up manuel right now?

his value is worth a 6th at best.
"
sunstersun,"no, but most people aren't claiming wilson is better than luck
"
sunstersun,"in full hindsight he was worth it, but at the time i thought he was taken a bit too early, nothing the dolphins could do though especially if they thought he was their guy and he was.
"
sunstersun,"We don't know what he told tell wells, what he tells the media is different.

"
sunstersun,"4 superbowls in a row would be insane.
 "
sunstersun,"No one could predict the knee injuries, before he destroyed his knee, he was better than luck.
"
sunstersun,"donald for martin.

deal or no deal.
"
sunstersun,"what's funny about this answer?
"
sunstersun,"Old England Patriots?
"
sunstersun,"3/11 balls were inexplicable by 0.3 psi, the rest of the patriot balls checked out.

also, since the nfl stupidly decided to not test the other colts balls it's a very sketchy thing to use it as the basis to determine how much a ball should deflated by gas laws.

if you average the balls of 11/11 versus 4/12, chances are you aren't gonna get an accurate reading.

"
sunstersun,"blame the patriots circlejerk for giving an answer that most fanbases agree with.
"
sunstersun,"I want a 150 mil/ 6 year deal.

what are the seahawks gonna do about it?
"
sunstersun,"no.

"
sunstersun,"eh unless it was a bit of a discount, signing him and dmac would cause a serious cap problem in the future when trying to sign jones, hightower, collins and solder.
"
sunstersun,"gonnna assume it's a good receiver and cb.

5 receptions 70 yards on 8-9 yargets.
"
sunstersun,"i kinda want manuel to succeed since he's such a great character, but he sucks as a QB.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; No on is taking anything away from Demarco...

the statement ""anyone will do well behind the cowboys o-line,"" is inherently taking away from murray's contribution.

like /u/jesperishere said, some cowboy fans aren't giving murray his credit. not you. you're tagged a cool cowboys fan.

&gt;  Im not sure where you got that. 

irrational cowboy fans who hate the eagles.


 "
sunstersun,"first two years he was not worth a 1st rounder, this year absolutely.

i thought he was taken a bit high since he was still a highly developmental project, but he's developed nicely.
"
sunstersun,"which thread will get deleted the fastest?
"
sunstersun,"that's only the tip of the iceberg for me. 

the other thing that pissed me off, is how dramatic they made the scouting seem. 

this is the nfl draft. there isn't panic scouting 10 minutes before your pick.


"
sunstersun,"i'd do away with the picks if brady's suspension goes away. i don't want brady to have a black mark on his career.
"
sunstersun,"uh, haven't you heard of the bountygate guy who sued the nfl and won?
"
sunstersun,"they can't even prove with 100% certainty the balls were deflated after the ref inspection.

"
sunstersun,"I'm going to sleep, while I don't agree with your POV, i do admire your conviction.

Good night, if you're still up for it, i'd like to continue this discussion.
"
sunstersun,"Yes, i'm asking what if the balls the refs were handed were lower than the accepted PSI when they handed the refs the balls and they didn't properly check/record said findings.

Wouldn't that explain the under inflated footballs at half time?




"
sunstersun,"your lol browns pot stirring is now second place two patriots are cheaters pot stirring.
"
sunstersun,"I mean none of us know really had to interpret the report since 243 pages is insane amount, he lied to the media, but we don't know if he lied to ted wells.

If i were to choose with as little bias as possible, 2-4 games.

"
sunstersun,"me?

"
sunstersun,"lol, you can't do that in an appeal.
"
sunstersun,"i'll bet you again
"
sunstersun,"nothing, if the ray rice scandal can't.
"
sunstersun,"spoiled.
"
sunstersun,"Except there isn't clear evidence that the balls were deflated. 

"
sunstersun,"and they would be wrong.
"
sunstersun,"you got the old post? does sound like me, but i don't remember the terms.

"
sunstersun,"wonder who will blink for first? raiders, chargers or rams
"
sunstersun,"i don't understand....

why not just pick him up later...
"
sunstersun,"lets scrap bro.
"
sunstersun,"i'm so sad.
"
sunstersun,"sigh, i mean i guess patriot fans deserve it.
"
sunstersun,"such an awesome nickname.

it flows really well when naming games too.

""The Mile High Miracle.""

"
sunstersun,"OH YEAH??????????????????????????????????????????

my dad can beat up your dad, and my brother is bigger than your brother, and my^penis^is^smaller^than^yours"
sunstersun,"**Patriots** vs Packers
"
sunstersun,"okay, maybe i should stfu since i'm not well educated on the matter.
"
sunstersun,"No you don't. I'm just going to assume you referring to knowing the ball boy. 

The only texts brady sent to the ball boy before the investigation started were to the general equipment manager. He also works with 100s of employees, it's very plausible to not know someone by name, but know their job. 

Also, calling someone after the investigation makes sense since you're trying to figure it out too.
"
sunstersun,"ah, picking one sentence out of 20,000 words is always a fun argument.
"
sunstersun,"so fucking stupid.
"
sunstersun,"It's hilarious how much flipflopping people use in arguments.

""The dallas o-line is so good it can make anyone look good. Therefore murray is overrated!""

""omg cowboys suxs, no running game without murray.""
"
sunstersun,"it's perriman...
"
sunstersun,Connor Cook.
sunstersun,"Brady, Lewis, LT. 
"
sunstersun,"probably reed, lewis TB12 and moss for me then.

although moss didn't really show up in the 2007 playoffs, so i dunno.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; I think Rodgers has the ability to be considered the GOAT at his position

longevity stats are gonna hurt him man, especially if he doesn't win another superbowl.

"
sunstersun,"nah, our real plan is not to raise the banner until brady's home opener.
"
sunstersun,"don't be stupid. 

"
sunstersun,"&gt; All Patriots game balls are found to be under inflated after the game. Colts balls are not under inflated.

What were the PSI of each ball when the refs checked them? 

If you can't answer this definitively, all the points after become moot.

"
sunstersun,"cause if he wants it badly enough it will happen.
"
sunstersun,"I mean in all fairness, there is stat correlation to support their claim.
"
sunstersun,"the players would be dead.
"
sunstersun,"can you link the article or twitter instead of just giving us a picture?

"
sunstersun," it's really confusing.

it's part of why Eli is so frustrating.

He's bloody brilliant in the post season and some seasons, then he's the worst QB in the league some seasons.

gotta tip the hat tho.

"
sunstersun,"yes it is. he took less money than talib, and i know you aren't gonna argue talib is better.
"
sunstersun,"I know, it's been 3-4 months since our last superbowl win.

"
sunstersun,"we weren't asked.
"
sunstersun,"AT LEAST HE PEES WHILE SITTING.

wait what?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; People don't hate Wes over the SB drop

Are you sure about that?"
sunstersun,"Yes I can say he didn't deserve a ring. If you're on a bad team then leave.
"
sunstersun,"The Brady effect.
"
sunstersun,"either could be fine.
"
sunstersun,"i guess, i'm just not against it if it protects against injury or stuff.
"
sunstersun,"you're exaggerating it so much. 

it's personal preference on grip.  it's also 0.4 psi which is the equivalent of a dollar bill weight.
"
sunstersun,"more probable that not something happens.
"
sunstersun,"i think they are equal too.

we don't need to mention the giants okay? they work their voodoo magic on rodgers and the 49ers in the post season too.
"
sunstersun,"how about rahim moore landing infront of jacoby jones.

:P
"
sunstersun,"this is actually a pretty interesting idea.

i guess jets, colts, broncos, bills, dolphins and raider fans would be immediately scratched off the list.
"
sunstersun,"yes he's better, but better to warrant 7 mil cap hit higher and a 2nd round pick?
 
nahhhh
"
sunstersun,"&gt;  probably because the Patriots tried to cover it up.

more shit made up.
"
sunstersun,"it's gonna end

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

"
sunstersun,"and... you made the shoe part up didn't you? signing autographs doesn't mean you know the person's name.

"
sunstersun,"Maybe, my perception of reed is distorted in fear "
sunstersun,"the comish isn't going to recuse him self.

every time he's put an arbitrator on the appeal, his suspensions have been over turned.

if he lets brady's appeal get overturned, it would look bad.
"
sunstersun,Cowboys
sunstersun,"lol, those comments in the vikings game.

This one stood out to me.

http://gyazo.com/bbad7e93dcefd4730c69ca151d480d83

No one gives a fuck about the integrity of the game.
"
sunstersun,"click bait title.
"
sunstersun,"i mean, there's been two instances of rape allegations with ben i guess.
"
sunstersun,"well your original comment was ""lol the nflpa"" so i assumed you thought neutral arbitration was a bad idea.
"
sunstersun,"http://www.nfl.com/player/mattcassel/2506562/careerstats

http://www.nfl.com/player/kyleorton/2506444/careerstats

stat wise higher career passer rating, and a way better year. cassel looked bad last year on the vikings.
"
sunstersun,"oh yeah?

o/ 

I just highfived myself mother fucker. 

oh and Wade is overrated and Lebron is better in Cleveland.

now what.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; How anyone can look at all of this and come to the conclusions Goodell is the problem is beyond me.

His lack of consistency like the Ray Rice and Bountygate punishments? 



"
sunstersun,"fuck this survey

where is the most handsome QB? Jimmy Garappolo "
sunstersun,"&gt;  Anderson also has been said to have a shotty memory. And the other gauge used would still put a lot of the balls under the psi limit. Not by much but still under the limit

okay, so shotty memory. we trust his testimony on the psi levels of the balls, since it fits the narrative, but we don't trust his memory when it fits the pats narrative.


&gt; . And the other gauge used would still put a lot of the balls under the psi limit

actually, if i recall the science investigation company said that the other gauge would make scientific sense of the patriot balls.


"
sunstersun,"vision is something nearly impossible to teach.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; And she was ugly.

deal breaker"
sunstersun,"instead of making a post that they will just delete, why not pm them.
"
sunstersun,"the devil.
"
sunstersun,"No one, at least not after one season.
"
sunstersun,"""We're both retiring so the eagles can win the nfc east.""
"
sunstersun,"No he just took a hometown paycut to stay in Denver. is he worth less than pat pete?


anyways, this is a pointless argument, because the stats need context and the context needs hours of viewing tapes.

I still don't think you can conclusively say CHJ isn't even close to Revis.
"
sunstersun,"I mean, regardless of guilty, Goodell appointing himself arbitrator for this case is pretty stupid.

and yes i do understand it's fully in his cba rights.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Hope he can find someone to take him, doesn't seem to have been much interest :(

I mean we need a receiver I think.
"
sunstersun,"colt fan who's switched to pats flair lol.
"
sunstersun,Because the nfl told the pats to suspend the employees ?
sunstersun,You absolutely know why. He's the best Rb in the game besides ap 
sunstersun,"lol. this is a joke site...
"
sunstersun,"so you have one instance of actual discipline i'm guessing?

"
sunstersun,"nothing i just wanted to know. 

i'm not accusing you of bandwagoning or something, i just know some adult dolphin fans who hate the jets more than NE.
"
sunstersun,"Browns.
"
sunstersun,"antonio gates.
"
sunstersun,"Eagles, bradford's 13 mil cap hit is off the table.
"
sunstersun,"Depends on your definition. But I'd bet at least brady did not order the balls to be deflated below 12.5.


There isn't evidence that brady ordered the balls to be deflated below 12.5

there isn't even evidence that the balls were deflated below 12.5 after the ref inspection. "
sunstersun,"houston is better imo.

"
sunstersun,"no, reason for the punishment from spygate was one game.

http://gyazo.com/64ce77dc48ed16f3b65626bc7aae151c

"
sunstersun,"No it doesn't ? 

The texts only start after brady complains in the aftermath of the jets patriots game.
"
sunstersun,"Pass it on the 1 yard line.
"
sunstersun,"i think romo is a better qb by a hair.
"
sunstersun,"well he totally destroyed wilfork in the divisional.
"
sunstersun,"what were the PSI of each ball when the refs tested them? could the balls have been been under psi before and the refs didn't check properly? i'm guessing the ref will say it's 12.5 psi, how do we trust his word when we know his rep/job is on the line? 



"
sunstersun,"u oke joker?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; t. Do you honestly believe in the minute 10 seconds that idiot had the balls in the bathroom with just a needle he was carefully measuring the PSI of each ball both before and after he deflated them? 

No I believe he was using the washroom.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Is there actually a reasonable basis to believe the AFCCG was the only time this happened?

sorry for the downvotes.

http://i.imgur.com/s7yn7DR.jpg"
sunstersun,"&gt; He can't play against the run! He's too one dimensional IMO.

are you just repeating what the critics say about him?

have you watched him play?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; He respects tables

so a traitor.

this isn't time for rationale thought okay?

"
sunstersun,"yeah, some patriot fans are dumb.
"
sunstersun,"uh....

dunno about that.
"
sunstersun,"deflategate?
"
sunstersun,"why the fuck would you not call the guy getting investigated to ask what happened? 

also not giving your cell phone over is a moot point, since any communication between the two would have a copy on the ball boys or general manager's phone.


"
sunstersun,"okay, in the eyes of the public is total bullshit
"
sunstersun,"i added it after.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; are you just making one now to justify Brady?

obviously, i'm a patriots homer.

"
sunstersun,"yes lost ending sucked, so did dexter's ending.
"
sunstersun,"there is a possibility that brady and kraft take it to court.
"
sunstersun,"yes he has.

0.3-4 psi will be brought up with brady's name for years. even if he wins his appeal.

"
sunstersun,This will get deleted 
sunstersun,"No, they interviewed every single ref officiating crew for patriot games for the past years and never once besides the afc championship game were the balls taken out of the refs sights.

&gt; Instead he covered it up and tried to hide evidence. That's what he is in trouble for.

i love how everyone just assumes thats what he's in trouble for.

"
sunstersun,"can you imagine gates and gronk in the redzone?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; And how about you release the information that would prove you were innocent?

What information could prove he's innocent? the information on his cell phone ? there are copies of what he sent to the two relevant people in this case in the cell phones.


"
sunstersun,"i know you're not gonna say it's because of cheating, because i know for a fact you didn't give this much shit to falcons or browns fans this season.
"
sunstersun,"There is no evidence that he ordered the balls to be deflated, there isn't even sure fire evidence the balls were deflated .

They didn't record the psi of the patriot balls and they only tested 4 colts balls "
sunstersun,"but his job is to deflate/inflate balls.

"
sunstersun,"you could maul the shit out of a receiver. while offences nowadays are entertaining, back 7 points was a lot harder.
"
sunstersun,"Yes, they would have a chance?

didn't they beat seattle?
"
sunstersun,"&gt; He was very consistent with the Rice punishment, it wasn't until the PR nightmare cropped up that they deviated from 

so he wasn't consistent.
"
sunstersun,"what do you mean the patriots lost a supernowl to the packers?
"
sunstersun,"Wasn't this disproven with the patriots fumble rates in comparison from home to away games considering i highly doubt they could deflate the the balls in away games for 7 something years and get away with it?
"
sunstersun,"nah....  the luck negotiations will go.

i want the highest paid contract.

oke luck don't leave us pls.
"
sunstersun,Carson Palmer
sunstersun,"well, i was gonna make a joke about collecting rings, then i saw your flair and quickly decided to avoid the subject.
"
sunstersun,"ya, but we're supposed to get cap relief for his bullshit.
"
sunstersun,"the disrespect marino gets on this sub is insane.

http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Recency_effect"
sunstersun,"push/under.

"
sunstersun,"yeah, the colts took a receiver.


"
sunstersun,"i guess, but we're talking about what's unrealistic.
"
sunstersun,"whatever about the nfl sting operation.

what i want to know, is if the nfl cared so much about integrity, why didn't they actually go through the proper means to make sure if the patriots cheated, they were caught red handed with verifiable information. specifically, they didn't log the PSI of the balls during the routine check up."
sunstersun,"i'm talking about his opinion that 4 games isn't a lot or a big deal.
"
sunstersun,"collect gates
"
sunstersun,"oooh, yeah i'd have to give the game to the broncos then.
"
sunstersun,"no one can beat the elite dragon.
"
sunstersun,"10-1 before palmer went down.
"
sunstersun,"lol as much as it's fun to discredit other teams due to cheating, that scandal was overblown, they didn't sign anyone they couldn't afford, they didn't promise money under the table to skirt the salary cap, they just pushed the payments for the salary too far back.
"
sunstersun,"Tom Brady 250 yards 2-3 tds 1 int 

"
sunstersun,"&gt; I have to wonder that if he did, does BB pony up for Revis?

we actually had the cap space to afford Revis, the only thing we didn't agree on was the guaranteed dollar.

I doubt that changes if dmac leaves.

"
sunstersun,"&gt; go to website **besides reddit**

i don't you know how this works... reddit is life.


"
sunstersun,Probably from brady but Kraft and bill were innocent 
sunstersun,"well do you disagree with any of the information the wikipedia stated?

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/sports/football/16spy.html?_r=0

here you go, the tapes were destroyed to ensure a level playing field, so the signals filmed might not give teams an advantage if it became available to the public.

also, we as fans are probably really biased when it comes to anything related to sports, we might see something and interpret it wrongly without enough context or knowledge of the situation.
"
sunstersun,"fair enough.
"
sunstersun,"i think you overestimate the impact of a one game suspension.
"
sunstersun,"no it isn't, your driving record has nothing to do with your job unless you're a professional driver.

"
sunstersun,Gronk
sunstersun,"absolutely, the only thing i have a pet peeve is with manning's performance in said superbowls.
"
sunstersun,you act like no one get's caught with PED's 
sunstersun,"titans have mariota, i'll take mariota even if he's unproven over cassel.
"
sunstersun,"whats the point of asking this before brady's ruling?

"
sunstersun,"except the guy said they should have dealt the punishment already, which means you didn't read shit. and you jump into a thread looking to whine about the patriots?
"
sunstersun,"duron carter shouldn't be listed there.
"
sunstersun,"right, in this case it wasn't a big deal, but in general you never know if you need to return to your old job.
"
sunstersun,"Brady, Tillman, Steve Smith, Woodson.

all i got off the top of my head.
"
sunstersun,"people forget cassel was a pro bowler after leaving to the chiefs.

&gt; But the team being built around Manning also helps Manning when it comes to stats as it isn't balanced at all.

this is an important point.
"
sunstersun,reputation 
sunstersun,"they are investing heavily into the last year before they have to pay luck, ty and fleener.
"
sunstersun,"there's a QB more dalton than dalton?

"
sunstersun,"there's literally no way lesean or fred jackson make it.

"
sunstersun,"&gt; Cassel &gt; Orton

nah.... also the bills will have a shit ton of o-line issues.
"
sunstersun,"nah you're stupid. they won the superbowl with properly inflated balls, they did better in the 2nd half with inflated balls.

you're just dumb and a troll.
 
"
sunstersun,"&gt; But bro it looks shady! It's the insinuation!
 is what i was comparing to.
"
sunstersun,"well yeah, i get downvoted too for a pro pats opinion.
"
sunstersun,"Rodgers, Brady, Manning
"
sunstersun,"&gt; It would also include outright lying about not knowing McNally

Everyone needs to stop looking at this from your own perspective. Look at it from Brady's perspective.

You work with 100's of employees, you know the functions of said employee, but you probably wouldn't be able to match names and faces.

there are no text messages between brady and mcnally before the investigation started."
sunstersun,"did you know anthony davis used to play basketball ?
"
sunstersun,"fuck the offesason.
"
sunstersun,"&gt;  I don't think Brady instructed them to deflate to underneath 12.5 PSI but I do think he wanted them to deflate to 12.5 PSI after the refs inspected.


this isn't proof of shit. this is your personal opinion or speculation.

"
sunstersun,"-_- i thought it would be different after selecting malcom brown.
"
sunstersun,"he had a decent season last year, surprising he was released.
"
sunstersun,"honestly, he's been robbed of decent quarterback play, he easily could have had top 5 WR stats if he didn't have 10 different quarterbacks in 3 years.
"
sunstersun,"i care more about brady's legacy.

how many high profile QB's get suspended?
"
sunstersun,"that still speaks volumes about how the ref check isn't properly done all the time.
"
sunstersun,"it was the old nickname for gronk and hernandez.

it's one of my favourite nick names. historical flavoured.
"
sunstersun,"see? you're not a giants fan and you're bring up giants accomplishments.
"
sunstersun,"well, i kind of expected it to be less of a big deal...

i guess patriots news just blows shit up and brings out the worse in people.
"
sunstersun,it's going to be hard to compare since rodgers won't touch a lot of QB longevity stats. 
sunstersun,"yeah it sucks.

i remember the 3 missed holding calls during the helmet catch too.
"
sunstersun,"because that doesn't support the argument duh.

"
sunstersun,"brady would never play for the patriots.
"
sunstersun,"it will probably burst after luck since there is literally 0 chance he doesn't get every penny he wants.
"
sunstersun,"oh honey...
"
sunstersun,"people just like to freak out over chip's off season moves, but i have full confidence the eagles will improve.

the only question mark is sam's health and algohor as a replacement for maclin.
"
sunstersun,"probably tate since he proved he could play the WR1 and doesn't have manning throwing to him
"
sunstersun,"he isn't even close to manning yet. and i'm a huge manning hater.
"
sunstersun,"if manning doesn't retire next season, they'll lose either DT or Von.
"
sunstersun,"pff is a better eye test than anyone here gives.
"
sunstersun,[I think you know it better than him](http://www.gfycat.com/DarlingIncredibleAllosaurus)
sunstersun,"eh the discount wasn't that much, NE was only 250k from 10 mil.
"
sunstersun,"&gt;  Also how do you hate them?

this

&gt;Because Rex Ryan"
sunstersun,they don't agree with logic or physics okay?
sunstersun,"nothing is wrong with brady telling them to deflate the footballs to 12.5 psi which in the text indicates.

the only illegal part would be deflating the ball after the ref inspection.

"
sunstersun,"why ...

"
sunstersun,"he's a rookie, he might out out performed some vets, but it's hard to put him higher since he's a rookie.
"
sunstersun,"i thought it was marioto?
 "
sunstersun,"&gt; I don't see why Brady should be entitled to an independent arbitrator

lol.


&gt;  No other player is

while true, other cases like ray rice have had 3rd part arbitrators.

&gt;  and a 4 game suspension isn't that egregious.

completely subjective.



"
sunstersun,"yes, a subpoena will be issued for brady's phone.

so will a subpoena for the nfl communications.

it will get ugly.
"
sunstersun,"that isn't against the rules though.
"
sunstersun,"eh, it's not the top tier competition.

ill check out the #1 qb in a game maybe, but that's mostly for the draft.
"
sunstersun,"that'd be fun to watch, wilson on the eagles with chip's system.
"
sunstersun,"you don't think that's a joke statement?

if you don't give me new shoes i'll tell espn ? does that seem reasonable to you ?


"
sunstersun,"why are you posting this in /r/nfl ?

"
sunstersun,"&gt; pats have and him lying and tryin to cover up

horseshit. we fully 100% co-operated with spygate. bill immediately came out and said he made a mistake.

so if we exclude this example from your history what else is there?
 

"
sunstersun,"Agreed, they've added mccoy who struggled behind the best o-line, harvin who's an injury mess and they have less options at the QB position.

"
sunstersun,"i actually wonder what the reaction would be like if luck was traded for a 1st.

never would happen, but what the fuck would you do if you were a fan lol.
"
sunstersun,"oh i know, but the guy seems to think tampering deserves fines or something, i just wanted to explain it's not a big deal.
"
sunstersun,"if i'm the texans i say no way.
"
sunstersun,"well why the fuck would you budge.

""I'm not here to answer questions about this.""

let me ask more questions about this.
"
sunstersun,"people just discount that 2012-2013 seasons like nothing after one bad season.

"
sunstersun,Bens suspension made no sense either 
sunstersun,"you're gonna ask the football sub about who they know more? a football player on one of the most popular teams versus a ""Female,"" MMA fighter, first of all it's not sexiest when I say female athletes are less known. Second MMA isn't mainstream at all at least in comparison to football. 

I'd say this is a pretty dumb question to ask here, try /r/AskReddit, the answer is probably Ronda.
"
sunstersun,"he also gets his receivers murdered.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; How does a bottom of the barrel team retain homegrown talent?

offer a market deal? 

abuse he comp system i guess.
"
sunstersun,"my gut feeling was telling me the seahawks were a better team.
"
sunstersun,"idk, it would seem like a jets thing to do.
"
sunstersun,"No it does, but there isn't a history of covering up and lying to the investigators like you make it out to be.

"
sunstersun,"How is the organization's fault if Brady and two ball boys break the rules? It's hilarious how people are actually blasting kraft and bill for this when the report cleared them. If Brady did deflate the balls, it's hardly their fault that they made ball handling jokes. 

also what the patriots say to the media should have no impact on the punishment. it has no impact on the integrity of the game at all.

failing to cooperate is such a vastly overstated term. they rejected a 5th interview after 4 interviews.
 
beyond that, nothing.


also patriot fans bring up ray rice because it's fucking clear the nfl didn't give many shits until the public gave a shit. "
sunstersun,"&gt; I will downvote ""garopologoat"" or whatever every time I see it

aren't you a martyr "
sunstersun,"yeah boston sports are insanely successful.

sox, celtics, patriots, and bruins combine for close to 10 championships in the past 15 years.
"
sunstersun,"okay, this debate is very off topic.
"
sunstersun,"100% of the video. even though what ap did was worse, rice is treated differently because it was made publicly.
"
sunstersun,"The Miami Fish

The New Jersey Jets.

The Buffalo Cattle.




"
sunstersun,"Reed, just give me Reed.
"
sunstersun,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugA8G4rv_8g

gives me chills every time.

hopefully megatron can STAY HEALTHY.
"
sunstersun,"if he had his last season 5 seasons in a row, i'd be hard pressed to say he isn't up there.
"
sunstersun,"there's literally no way paying 7500 dollars in any way to tamper with footballs is allowed.
"
sunstersun,"motherfucker, that last photo WHY.....
"
sunstersun,"yes. yes it does.
"
sunstersun,"best game i watched was ravens chargers or chargers 49ers
"
sunstersun,"if it aien't broke don't fix it.

"
sunstersun,"it's 10 seasons to 9 seasons.

he's entering his 10th with the colts.
 "
sunstersun,"wow
"
sunstersun,"I call playing the role of tom brady, and in order to better simulate him, i require some examination time with gazelle.
"
sunstersun,"okay there, he's not worth a 1st, but he's worth more than a 5th.

i'd give a 2nd for him.
"
sunstersun,"turnovers =/= exciting game.

unless it's like solid defense, it was mostly grossman throwing INTS.
"
sunstersun,"The patriots 2nd rounder made no sense.
"
sunstersun,"well we know willis was better.
"
sunstersun,"always could go the nuclear option: injunction and waste time in court.
 "
sunstersun,"&gt; They did, but didn't gain a competitive advantage in doing so. That's what the NFL ruled as well. 

i doubt that since they fined the broncos pretty hard with cash and picks.

do you have a link for it ?
"
sunstersun,"There is a good chance.
 
sure some teams might cite improvement, but every team improves.
"
sunstersun,"megathreads are stupid as fuck
"
sunstersun,"superbowls - cards steelers is one of the best even though i hated the result.

"
sunstersun,"""Deflator comments,"" - joke, perfectly reasonable since it's their job to deflate balls and making jokes about their job makes sense.

""going to espn,"" doesn't refer to deflating footballs, it could literally be anything. 

mcnally breaking protocol - bad.

also, one important part you forget is there isn't solid proof the balls were deflated, only 3 of the patriot balls tested 0.4 psi below the supposed psi of the ball due to gas law. and it's actually explained by the gauge that anderson testified he used.

"
sunstersun,"ngata chance ngata is top 5 anymore.
"
sunstersun,"lol are the packers gonna get an ILB this draft?
"
sunstersun,"Lol anyone that says pff is bad based on its objectivity is right, but at the same time I doubt anyone watches nearly the same amount of tape these guys don"
sunstersun,"mostly because the bears had no chance of winning because grossman was tossing the game away. also peyton is sloppy as hell in rain/bad conditions.

"
sunstersun,"wilfork pushed the lineman into him i think.
"
sunstersun,"What would you rank his status in the top receiver category ? Like megaton Julio DeZ and brown, ...?

He's around 10-12 for me so it's reasonable where he's stated "
sunstersun,"&gt;  I think we edge them out slightly due to a stronger defense outside of the DL. 

Jets have a better secondary.
"
sunstersun,"yup it's very sad.

maybe if he was a 3 time superbowl champion, but oh well.

"
sunstersun,"yes and the patriots beat the toughest team in the nfc.
"
sunstersun,"The leagues punishment system is based on public opinion.

Ray rice beats his wife? 2 games

Ray rice beats his wife on video where public outrage happens ?

Suspended indefinitely "
sunstersun,"should relax man, it's not serious lol.
"
sunstersun,"yeah and there is a debate about whether the earth is round or flat.
"
sunstersun,"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000091683/article/san-diego-chargers-fined-20k-by-nfl-in-towel-case

here you go.


""However, NFL game officials are charged with protecting the integrity and competitive fairness of the games and club staff members, like players and coaches, have a clear obligation to cooperate in this effort and comply with the direction of game officials. As a result of the failure of club staff to follow the directive of a game official to immediately surrender the towels when directed to do so, and to attempt to conceal the towels, the Chargers have been fined $20,000.

attempted to conceal the towels rather than immediately surrender them.

"
sunstersun,"lol, the timing is too convenient.
"
sunstersun,"very true, still had a very down year.

"
sunstersun,"JT doesn't make it imo. 

Peyton, Von DT, and CHJ are locks.  

Ward has no chance imo, Ware probably doesn't either.
"
sunstersun,"this is 2014.

we're talking about 2013.
"
sunstersun,"well his statement isn't wrong. he's a homer and a bro.
"
sunstersun,"right because the falcons had soooo much media coverage.
"
sunstersun,300mil of tax payers dollars 
sunstersun,"yeah it's alot, but it's not as much as you guys make it out to be.
"
sunstersun,"right, i don't deny he had a great effect on our line, i'm just saying some patriot fans overrate his individual play.
"
sunstersun,"i mean I could post the 3 ints on 8 passes if you wanted.
"
sunstersun,"no one knows.
"
sunstersun,"i think it was a hyper extension.
"
sunstersun,"better but not garbage.
"
sunstersun,Comeback IMO 
sunstersun,"


&gt; It was illegal during the game and the refs didn't call it.

so why do the patriots deserve an asterisk over it?  it's up to the ref to call it.

if i commit holding on every down like most o-line men do, does that mean everyone deserve an asterisk?

are you a panthers fan or something?

"
sunstersun,"in all fairness, it's not always because of stats.

remember stats are always inflated. but still, the main reason harrison might not get in is the absurd backlog of WR's that should get in.
"
sunstersun,"2010 was pretty great too.

but yeah 0-4 was stacked both sides.
"
sunstersun,"okay, this is just a joke list.

"
sunstersun,:(
sunstersun,"only 4 footballs were tested, it's honestly a shame they weren't all tested since it would clear up a lot of discrepancies.
"
sunstersun,No this relationship is dead 
sunstersun,"holy shit this thread is a shit show.
"
sunstersun,"maybe you haven't, but it's more common, and as an example, not everything should be taken literally.

"
sunstersun,"it would be a fair deal, but no way would i do it for sentimental purposes.
"
sunstersun,"pro bowls mean nothing. especially if Lavonte david doesn't make the probowl despite being on pace with kuechly in terms of stats.


his stats that year certainty didn't warrant a pro bowl invite.
 "
sunstersun,"you're putting words into everyone's mouth here.

i think belichick is a creative genius, but i don't think he does more to help the patriots win than brady.


seriously, you've warped the arguments and made non related points like 5 times this thread.
"
sunstersun,"you can appeal punishment.
"
sunstersun,"Started from the bottom and now we're here.
"
sunstersun,"who else is in the running for best MLB?

urlacher? Lambert? "
sunstersun,"he'll make it. vinateri is a lock.
"
sunstersun,"i'm not saying he's a WR1, but he's plenty fine for a WR3.

"
sunstersun,"\o 

INTERCEPTED "
sunstersun,"i did, my source specifically counters your source. "
sunstersun,"we also collect gates.
"
sunstersun,"injured too often, his numbers weren't that great and didn't play enough games imo.
"
sunstersun,Yeah my bad 
sunstersun,"The underrated aspect of the Jets 2009/2010 afc championship game runs were how good that o-line was. 

The bills have a below average line, and i'd take sanchez over manuel anyday.


"
sunstersun,"how to stop seahawks in the redzone.


http://www.gfycat.com/DarlingIncredibleAllosaurus"
sunstersun,"Malcolm Brown.
"
sunstersun,"that's fine, i agree it makes sense.

just don't use the integrity of the game bullshit reason then.
"
sunstersun,"no, i understand he may have lied to the public but thats a terrible explanation for a suspension
"
sunstersun,"sucked after trinity.

"
sunstersun,"no no you don't understand, the stats I use are perfect for ranking QB.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; Most GMs (Really all but Jerry) 

Bill could probably do it.
"
sunstersun,"We're not talking about cheating, I'm talking about the incompetence of the league when it comes to investigations.
"
sunstersun,"4th an 2
"
sunstersun,"it is, but that doesn't mean it doesn't factor into the HOF committee.
"
sunstersun,brady
sunstersun,"lol 2 superbowl losses fuck that.
"
sunstersun,"because you want him to bust.
"
sunstersun,"fuck me, gregory is gonna go to the jets isn't he?
"
sunstersun,"i guess i would too and that's evidenced by the pick they had to give up.
"
sunstersun,"very steep.
"
sunstersun,"well the bills were 9-7 and the jets were 4-12 last year, regardless of the jets additions it's hard to ignore that gap in W/L"
sunstersun,"his name is lord bridgewater.
"
sunstersun,"i think ted's been pretty hit or miss when it comes to defense.

offence wise he's got the receiver thing down.
"
sunstersun,"i'm guessing he's talking about the 5th year option that seattle didn't take.
"
sunstersun,"brady didn't do great the first 4 games.
"
sunstersun,"lol, you guys have the easiest division by far...
"
sunstersun,"lol, why are you a fan if you have no faith ?
"
sunstersun,"chris matthews line up with browner so kearse doesn't get jammed at least.
"
sunstersun,"it's okay haha, he's been there quite a while.
"
sunstersun,"&gt; But look, that doesn't matter. Thanks for playing the game, and here's to a good, injury free, season to us both. Cheers.

cheers!

"
sunstersun,Tom Brady
sunstersun,"ya, although in all fairness, this seems more complicated than most of us expected like usual.
"
sunstersun,"oh yeah, i'm sure mcnally walked into the bathroom and deflated 3 footballs by  0.4 psi, since all the other balls checked out.
"
sunstersun,"I'm curious what bengals fans think of dalton?

do they need to draft a QB next year?
"
sunstersun,"at least raider fans i saw on there sub wanted williams. 

especially since he's a raiders fan.
"
sunstersun,"isn't this statement a bit rash since the league could come out and not suspend Brady?
 "
sunstersun,"fair point, but it shouldn't take a leaked video to get a fair punishment,"
sunstersun,"i have you tagged as if the jets go 4-12, you'll punch your grandma.
"
sunstersun,"he also has like 10 tds rushing and 700 yards rushing.

"
sunstersun,"eh, i'd put grimes at #6

CHJ, Revis, Sherman, Haden, and Davis.
"
sunstersun,"Very good point about demarco as well.

it's just how it is.

ps: i hate you
"
sunstersun,"uh, well yes he should probably be careful with his words.

he should have probably been more careful with his words at the original press conference."
sunstersun,"well 32/32 teams can't have a good draft.
"
sunstersun,"unless it's the patriots lol.
"
sunstersun,"except, adam schefter just said the nfl told them to suspend the employees. so you can't.
"
